# Logging

{% include [logging-preview](../../_includes/smartwebsecurity/logging-preview.md) %}

{{ sws-name }} enables you to log and analyze data on requests and rules they trigger. You can use this data to configure protection and investigate incidents.

There are two logging options available:

* Logging via {{ sws-name }}.
* Logging via the {{ alb-name }} instance the security profile is connected to.

This section covers logging via {{ sws-name }}. This method provides more advanced analysis compared to logging via {{ alb-name }}. For information on request logging via an L7 load balancer, see [{#T}](../operations/configure-logging-alb.md).

Logs contain information about HTTP requests processed by {{ sws-name }}. You can only log requests that were blocked with a `DENY` verdict or sent to captcha with a `CAPTCHA` verdict. Additionally, you can log some legitimate requests with an `ALLOW` verdict. To reduce the size of logs, specify a sampling rate for such requests between 1% and 100%.

{{ sws-name }} delivers logs in JSON format. Each log entry contains the following structural blocks: 

1. Log system fields that contain service information of the monitoring system. Only one field is significant for analysis: the `time` the event occurred in the protected system, with nanosecond precision.
1. `labels` block: Set of `<name>=<value>` pairs for log identification and quick filtering by different slices. You can also use top-level fields for filtering.
1. `message` block: Short text log message in [Unicode](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) format.
1. `meta` block: Request metadata, which is detailed parameters of triggered rules and request parameters.
   
The description of SWS log fields is given in the table below.

To analyze {{ sws-name }} logs, create requests with the required fields and their combinations. Check the examples of ready-made requests in [Examples of preset log filters](../operations/configure-logging.md#filtration).

## Using logs when setting up protection {#log-uses}

To ensure {{ sws-name }} does not disrupt your service availability while maintaining an adequate level of protection:

1. Enable logging in your security profile.
1. Set all rules to **{{ ui-key.yacloud.smart-web-security.overview.column_dry-run-rule }}** mode.
1. Check the logs for correct traffic filtering.
1. After checking, disable the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.smart-web-security.overview.column_dry-run-rule }}** mode.

Each time you update or add security profile, WAF, or ARL rules, enable the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.smart-web-security.overview.column_dry-run-rule }}** mode. Activate a rule only after the logs confirm that it works correctly.
