# Autoscaling of subclusters


{% note info %}

Autoscaling of subclusters is supported for {{ dataproc-full-name }} clusters version 1.4 and higher.

{% endnote %}



{{ dataproc-full-name }} supports autoscaling of [data processing subclusters](../concepts/index.md) based on metrics received by [{{ monitoring-full-name }}](../../monitoring/concepts/index.md):


* If the metric value exceeds the specified threshold, new hosts are added to a subcluster. You can use them in a YARN cluster running Apache Spark or Apache Hive as soon as the host status changes to **Alive**.
* If the value of the key metric falls below the specified threshold, the processes of [decommissioning](decommission.md) and removing redundant hosts are started sequentially in the subcluster.

Read more about autoscaling mechanisms in the [{{ ig-name }} documentation](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#auto-scale).

You can choose the scaling method that best suits your needs:

* **Default scaling**: Scaling based on the `yarn.cluster.containersPending` metric.

    This is an internal YARN metric that shows the number of resource allocation units that pending jobs in the queue expect to be assigned. It's a good fit for clusters that have lots of relatively small jobs managed by Apache HadoopÂ® YARN. This scaling method doesn't require additional configuration.

* **Target CPU utilization level**: Scaling based on the vCPU usage metric. Learn more about this type of scaling in the [{{ ig-name }} documentation](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#cpu-utilization).

To set up autoscaling of your cluster based on other metrics and formulas, [contact](../../support/qa.md) support.

You can set the following autoscaling parameters:

* The initial (minimum) size of the group.
* [Decommissioning](decommission.md) timeout. Set in seconds. The maximum value is `86400` seconds (24 hours). The default value is `120` seconds.
* Type of VM instances: standard or preemptible.
* Maximum group size.
* The time period used when calculating the average load on each VM instance in the group.
* Instance warmup period. The interval during which instance metrics are not used after it starts. Average metric values for the group are used instead.
* Stabilization period (minutes or seconds): The interval during which the number of instances in the group can't be decreased.
