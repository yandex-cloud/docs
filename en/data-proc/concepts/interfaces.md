# Working with component network interfaces

{{ dataproc-name }} enables you to create clusters accessible from the internet or only from a cloud network. However, we recommend making service component interfaces inaccessible from outside {{ yandex-cloud }} in any configuration. To connect externally to components like HDFS NameNode and YARN ResourceManager, you can route traffic via an intermediate VM with a public IP address.

## Port forwarding {#routing}

To access the network interface of a component from the web, [create](../../compute/operations/vm-create/create-linux-vm.md) an intermediate virtual machine in {{compute-full-name}}.

Requirements for an intermediate VM:

* An assigned public IP address.
* Hosted in the same network as the required {{ dataproc-name }} cluster.
* [Security group settings](network.md#security-groups) that allow traffic exchange with the cluster via the corresponding components' ports.

For step-by-step instructions on how to configure security groups for port forwarding, see [{#T}](../operations/connect.md).

To connect to the desired {{ dataproc-name }} host port, run the following command:

```bash
ssh -A -J <VM public IP address> -L <port number>:<FQDN of Data Proc host>:<port number> root@<FQDN of Data Proc host>
```

You can find the FQDN of the {{ dataproc-name }} host on the {{ dataproc-name }} cluster page, in the **Hosts** tab, under the **Hostname** column.

The port numbers used for {{ dataproc-name }} components are given below.
