# Backups

{{ dataproc-name }} does not automate cluster data backups. You can protect your data from loss and corruption with standard Hadoop tools for creating backups and store them using [{{ objstorage-full-name }}]({{ link-cloud-services }}/storage).

{{ objstorage-name }} services are [charged separately](../../storage/pricing.md).
