# Pricing for {{ dataproc-name }}

{% include [currency-choice](../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}

## What goes into the cost of using {{ dataproc-name }} {#rules}

Price calculations for the usage of  {{ dataproc-name }} takes into account the use of host computing resources, storage and egress traffic:

* vCPU or GPU usage time,

* amount of RAM used per unit of time (GB×hour),

* {{ compute-full-name }} platform that is specified when creating hosts,

* storage type and size for each host (disk space),

* The amount of outgoing traffic.

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### Use of computing resources {#rules-compute}

The cost is calculated for each hour of operation of the host in accordance with the requested computing resources. Prices of computing resources are calculated based on [prices for similar resources for {{ compute-name }}](../compute/pricing.md#prices), with a markup for using {{ dataproc-name }} images.

The minimum billing unit is one hour (for example, the cost of 1.5 hours of operation is the same as the cost of 2 hours of operation). You are not charged for time when the {{ dataproc-name }} host is not performing its main functions.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

What's charged is the amount of storage allocated for each of the cluster hosts.

The cost is specified for one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per hour (for example, the cost of storing 1 GB for 1.5 hours is equal to the cost of storage for 2 hours).
