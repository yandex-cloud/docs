# Connecting to {{ dataproc-name }} clusters

After creating a {{ dataproc-name }} cluster, you can connect to hosts of subclusters:

* Over the internet, if you have public access configured for your subcluster.
* From a {{ yandex-cloud }} [virtual machine](../../compute/operations/vm-create/create-linux-vm.md) located on the same cloud network.

## Configuring security groups {#configuring-security-groups}

{% include [security-groups-note](../../_includes/vpc/security-groups-note-services.md) %}

Security groups might block cluster connections. If this happens, edit the group rules.

{% note alert %}

When setting up security groups, don't change the [rules for service traffic](./cluster-create.md#change-security-groups). This may cause the cluster to fail.

{% endnote %}

Settings of rules depend on the connection method you select:

{% list tabs %}

- SSH

   * To connect to your subcluster hosts from cloud networks and the internet, [set up security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) for your cluster to allow incoming traffic from any IP address on port `{{ port-ssh }}`. To do this, create the following rule for incoming traffic:

      * Port range: `{{ port-ssh }}`.
      * Protocol: `TCP`.
      * Source: `CIDR`.
      * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

   * To connect to a cluster from an intermediate VM:

      1. [Configure the security group](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) where the VM is located to allow connections to the VM and traffic between the VM and subcluster hosts. To do this, create the following rules:

         * For incoming traffic:

            * Port range: `{{ port-ssh }}`.
            * Protocol: `TCP`.
            * Source: `CIDR`.
            * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

         * For outgoing traffic:

            * Port range: `{{ port-ssh }}`.
            * Protocol: `TCP`.
            * Destination type: `CIDR`.
            * CIDR blocks: Address range of the subnet where the hosts of the cluster are located. If subclusters are in different subnets, create this rule for each subnet.

      1. [Configure security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) in the cluster to allow incoming traffic from the security group where the VM is located on port `{{ port-ssh }}`. To do this, create the following rule for incoming traffic:

         * Port range: `{{ port-ssh }}`.
         * Protocol: `TCP`.
         * Source: `CIDR`.
         * CIDR blocks: Address range of the subnet where the hosts of the cluster are located.

- UI Proxy

   To use [**UI Proxy**](../concepts/interfaces.md), [add](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) rules to the subcluster host's security group to allow incoming traffic via port `{{ port-https }}`:

   * Port range: `{{ port-https }}`.
   * Protocol: `TCP`.
   * Source: `CIDR`.
   * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

   If the connection is established via an intermediate VM, [add](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) rules to the subcluster host's security group to allow connections via this VM:

   * For incoming traffic:

      * Port range: `{{ port-https }}`.
      * Protocol: `TCP`.
      * Source: `CIDR`.
      * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

   * For outgoing traffic:

      * Port range: `{{ port-https }}`.
      * Protocol: `TCP`.
      * Destination type: `CIDR`.
      * CIDR blocks: Address range of the subnet where the host of the subcluster is located.

- Connecting with port forwarding

   When using [port forwarding](../operations/connect-interfaces.md#routing), [add](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) rules to the intermediate VM security group that allow incoming and outgoing traffic via the required components' ports:

   * Port range: `<component port>`.

      Port numbers for {{ dataproc-name }} components are shown in the table:

      {% include [ports-table](../../_includes/data-proc/ports-table.md) %}

   * Protocol: `TCP`.
   * Source: `CIDR`.
   * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

{% endlist %}

{% note info %}

You can set more detailed rules for security groups, such as allowing traffic in only specific subnets.

Security groups must be configured correctly for all subnets where cluster hosts will be located.

{% endnote %}

For more information about security groups, see [{#T}](../concepts/network.md#security-groups).

## Connecting to a {{ dataproc-name }} host via SSH {#data-proc-ssh}

To connect to a {{ dataproc-name }} host, make sure the SSH key that you specified when creating the {{ dataproc-name }} cluster is accessible on the local machine or the VM. You can copy the key to the machine from which the connection is performed to the cluster, or connect to it with an SSH agent.

1. (Optional) [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the intermediate virtual machine via SSH.

1. Launch the SSH agent:

   ```bash
   eval `ssh-agent -s`
   ```

1. Add the required key to the list of those available to the agent:

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/example-key
   ```

1. Open an SSH connection to the {{ dataproc-name }} host by specifying its FQDN or IP address if public access is enabled for the host.  For image 2.0, specify the `ubuntu` user, for image 1.4 — `root`. For example:  

   ```bash
   ssh ubuntu@rc1b-dataproc-m-fh4y4nur0i0uqqkz.{{ dns-zone }}
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   ubuntu@rc1b-dataproc-m-fh4y4nur0i0uqqkz:~#
   ```

1. Make sure that Hadoop commands are executed, for example:

   ```bash
   hadoop version
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   Hadoop 2.8.5
   Subversion https://github.yandex-team.ru/mdb/bigtop.git -r 78508f2a4b4f3dc8b3d295ccb50a45a4d24e81b5
