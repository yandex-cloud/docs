# Connecting to {{ dataproc-name }} clusters

After creating a {{ dataproc-name }} cluster, you can connect to the host of the main subcluster.

Cluster hosts cannot be assigned a public IP address, so you need to use a VM from the same {{ yandex-cloud }} network to connect to them.

1. [Create a new VM](../../compute/operations/vm-create/create-linux-vm.md) if necessary.
1. Connect to the VM via [SSH](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md).
1. You should also use SSH to connect to the host of the main subcluster from your VM.

{% note alert %}

When you [configure security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-update.md), don't change the [rules for service traffic](./cluster-create.md#change-security-groups). This may cause the cluster to fail.

{% endnote %}

* SSH

    1. Add the rules to the intermediate VM security groups:

        * For incoming traffic:
            
			* Protocol: `TCP`.
            * Port range: `{{ port-ssh }}`.
            * Source type: `CIDR`.
            * Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`.

        * For outgoing traffic:
            
			* Protocol: `TCP`.
            * Port range: `{{ port-ssh }}`.
            * Source type: `CIDR`.
            * Purpose: the address range of the subnet where the hosts of the main subcluster are located.

    1. To connect to main subcluster hosts with an intermediate VM, add rules to the main subcluster host security groups that allow incoming traffic via port `{{ port-ssh }}`:
        
		* Protocol: `TCP`.
        * Port range: `{{ port-ssh }}`.
        * Source type: `CIDR`.
        * Purpose: the address range of the subnet where the hosts of the main subcluster are located.

* UI Proxy

    To use [**UI Proxy**](../concepts/ui-proxy.md), add rules to the main subcluster host security group that allow incoming traffic via port `{{ port-https }}`:
    
	* Protocol: `TCP`.
    * Port range: `{{ port-https }}`.
    * Source type: `CIDR`.
    * Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`.

    If the connection is performed via an intermediate VM, add rules to the main subcluster host security group that allow the appropriate connections:

    * For incoming traffic:
        
		* Protocol: `TCP`.
        * Port range: `{{ port-https }}`.
        * Source type: `CIDR`.
        * Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`.

    * For outgoing traffic:
        
		* Protocol: `TCP`.
        * Port range: `{{ port-https }}`.
        * Source type: `CIDR`.
        * Purpose: the address range of the subnet where the hosts of the main subcluster are located.

* Connecting with port forwarding

    When using [port forwarding](../concepts/interfaces.md#routing), add rules to the intermediate VM security group that allow incoming and outgoing traffic via the required components' ports:

    * Protocol: `TCP`.
    * Port range: `<component_port>`.

        Port numbers for {{ dataproc-name }} components are shown in the table:

        {% include [ports-table](../../_includes/data-proc/ports-table.md) %}

    * Source type: `CIDR`.
    * Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`.

{% endlist %}

{% note info %}

You can set more detailed rules for security groups, such as to allow traffic in only specific subnets.

Security groups must be configured correctly for all subnets where cluster hosts will be located.

{% endnote %}

## Connecting to a {{ dataproc-name }} host via SSH {#data-proc-ssh}

To connect to a {{ dataproc-name }} host from your VM, make sure the SSH key that you specified when creating the {{ dataproc-name }} cluster is accessible on it. You can copy the key to the VM or connect to it with an SSH agent.

1. Run the SSH agent locally:

    ```bash
    $ eval `ssh-agent -s`
    ```

1. Add the required key to the list of those available to the agent:

   ```bash
   $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/example-key
   ```

1. Open an SSH connection to the {{ dataproc-name }} host for the `root` user, for example:

   ```bash
   $ ssh root@rc1b-dataproc-m-fh4y4nur0i0uqqkz.mdb.yandexcloud.net
   
   root@rc1b-dataproc-m-fh4y4nur0i0uqqkz:~#
   ```

1. Make sure that Hadoop commands are executed, for example:

    ```bash
    ~# hadoop version
    
    Hadoop 2.8.5
    Subversion https://github.yandex-team.ru/mdb/bigtop.git -r 78508f2a4b4f3dc8b3d295ccb50a45a4d24e81b5
