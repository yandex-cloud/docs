# Editing clusters

After creating a cluster, you can modify its basic and advanced settings.

{% list tabs %}

* Management console

    1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ dataproc-name }}**.

    1. Select the cluster and click **Edit cluster** in the top panel.

    1. To edit the [log group](../../logging/concepts/log-group.md/) that cluster logs are sent to, select a new log group from the list. If necessary, [create a new log group](../../logging/operations/create-group.md).

        To enable this feature, [assign the cluster service account](../../iam/operations/roles/grant.md#access-to-sa) the `logging.writer` role. For more information, see the [{{ cloud-logging-full-name }} documentation](../../logging/security/index.md).

        The `â€”` value in the **Log group** field disables sending cluster logs to {{ cloud-logging-name }}.

    1. Change additional cluster settings:

        **Deletion protection**: Manages cluster protection from accidental deletion by a user.

        Enabled protection will not prevent a manual connection to a cluster to delete data.

    1. Click **Save changes**.

* CLI

    {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

    {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

    1. View a description of the CLI's update cluster command:

        ```bash
        yc dataproc cluster update --help
        ```

    1. To edit the [log group](../../logging/concepts/log-group.md) that cluster logs are sent to, pass the log group ID in the `--log-group-id` parameter:

        ```bash
        yc dataproc cluster update <cluster ID or name> \
           --log-group-id=<log group ID>
        ```

        An empty string (`""`) passed instead of the cluster ID in the `--log-group-id` parameter disables sending cluster logs to {{ cloud-logging-name }}.

        You can request the log group ID with a [list of log groups in the folder](../../logging/operations/list.md).

    1. To protect a cluster from accidental deletion by a user of your cloud, set `--deletion-protection` to `true`:

        ```bash
        yc dataproc cluster update <cluster ID or name> \
           --deletion-protection=<protect cluster from deletion: true or false>
        ```

        Enabled protection will not prevent a manual connection to a cluster to delete data.

    You can query the cluster ID and name with a [list of clusters in the folder](./cluster-list.md#list).
