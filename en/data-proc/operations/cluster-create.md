# Creating a {{ dataproc-name }} cluster

The minimum required role for creating a {{ dataproc-name }} cluster is `editor`. For more information, see the [role description](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles#editor).

## Configure a network {#setup-network}

In the subnet that the subcluster with master host will connect to, enable [egress NAT](../../vpc/operations/enable-nat.md). This will enable the subcluster to interact with {{ yandex-cloud }} services or hosts on other networks.

## Configure security groups {#change-security-groups}

{% note warning %}

Security groups must be created and configured before creating a cluster. If the selected security groups don't have the required rules, {{ yandex-cloud }} disables cluster creation.

{% endnote %}

1. [Create](../../vpc/operations/security-group-create.md) one or more security groups for cluster service traffic.
1. [Add rules](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md):

   * One rule for inbound and outbound service traffic:

      * Port range: `{{ port-any }}`.
      * Protocol: ``Any``.
      * Source: `Security group`.
      * Security group: `Self` (`Self`).

   * A separate rule for outgoing HTTPS traffic:

      * Port range: `{{ port-https }}`.
      * Protocol: `TCP`.
      * Source type: `CIDR`.
      * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

      This will enable you to use [{{ objstorage-full-name }} buckets](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md), [UI Proxy](../concepts/interfaces.md), and cluster [autoscaling](../concepts/autoscaling.md).

If you plan to use multiple security groups for a cluster, enable all traffic between these groups.

{% note info %}

You can set more detailed rules for security groups, such as allowing traffic in only specific subnets.

Security groups must be configured correctly for all subnets that will include cluster hosts.

{% endnote %}

You can set up security groups for [connections to cluster hosts](connect.md) via an intermediate VM after creating a cluster.

## Create a cluster {#create}

A cluster must include a subcluster with a master host and at least one subcluster for data storage or processing.

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you want to create a cluster.

   1. Click **Create resource** and select ![image](../../_assets/data-proc/data-proc.svg)Â **{{ dataproc-name }} cluster** from the drop-down list.

   1. Name the cluster in the **Cluster name** field. Naming requirements:

      * It must be unique within the folder.

      {% include [name-format.md](../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

   1. Select a suitable [image version](../concepts/environment.md) and the services you would like to use in the cluster.

      {% include [note-light-weight-cluster](../../_includes/data-proc/note-light-weight-cluster.md) %}

      {% note tip %}

      To use the most recent image version, specify `2.0`.

      {% endnote %}

   1. Enter the public part of your SSH key in the **SSH key** field. For information about how to generate and use SSH keys, see the [{{ compute-full-name }} documentation](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md).
   1. Select or create a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) to be granted cluster access.
   1. Select the availability zone for the cluster.
   1. If necessary, configure the [properties of cluster components](../concepts/settings-list.md), jobs, and the environment.
   1. If necessary, specify the custom [initialization scripts](../concepts/init-action.md) of cluster hosts. For each script, specify:

      * **URI**: Link to the initialization script in the `https://`, `http://`, `hdfs://`, or `s3a://` scheme.
      * (Optional) **Timeout**: The script execution timeout (in seconds). If your initialization script runs longer than this time, it will be terminated.
      * (Optional) **Arguments**: The list of arguments of your initialization script, enclosed in square brackets `[]` and separated by commas, for example:

         ```text
         ["arg1","arg2",...,"argN"]
         ```

   1. Select the name of a bucket in {{ objstorage-full-name }} to store job dependencies and results.
   1. Select a network for the cluster.
   1. Select security groups that have the required permissions.

      {% note warning %}

      When creating a cluster, security group settings are verified. If a cluster cannot function with these settings, a warning is issued. A sample functional configuration is provided [above](#change-security-groups).

      {% endnote %}

   1. Enable the **UI Proxy** option to access the [web interfaces of {{ dataproc-name }} components](../concepts/interfaces.md).
      
   1. Cluster logs are saved in [{{ cloud-logging-full-name }}](../../logging/). Select a log group from the list or [create a new one](../../logging/operations/create-group.md).

      To enable this functionality, [assign the cluster service account](../../iam/operations/roles/grant.md#access-to-sa) the `logging.writer` role. For more information, see the [{{ cloud-logging-full-name }} documentation](../../logging/security/index.md).

   1. Configure subclusters: no more than one subcluster with a master host (called **Master**) and subclusters for data storage or processing.

      Storage and processing subcluster roles are different: you can deploy data storage components on data storage subclusters and computing components on data processing subclusters. Storage on a data processing subcluster is only used to temporarily store processed files.

   1. For each subcluster, you can configure:

      * The number of hosts.
      * [Host class](../concepts/instance-types.md): The platform and computing resources available to the host.
      * [Storage](../concepts/storage.md) size and type.
      * The subnet of the network where the cluster is located.

      NAT to the internet must be enabled in the subnet for the subcluster with the master host. For more information, see [{#T}](#setup-network).

      1. To access subcluster hosts from the internet, select **Public access**. In this case, you can only connect to subcluster hosts over an SSL connection. For more information, see [{#T}](connect.md).

      {% note warning %}

      After you create your cluster, you can't request or disable public access to the subcluster. However, you can delete a data processing subcluster and then create it again with a relevant public access setting.

      {% endnote %}

   1. For data processing subclusters, you can specify the [autoscaling](../concepts/autoscaling.md) parameters.

      {% include [note-info-service-account-roles](../../_includes/data-proc/service-account-roles.md) %}

      1. Under **Add subcluster**, click **Add**.
      1. In the **Roles** field, select `COMPUTENODE`.
      1. Under **Scalability**, enable **Automatic scaling**.
      1. Set autoscaling parameters.
      1. The default metric used for autoscaling is `yarn.cluster.containersPending`. To enable scaling based on CPU usage, disable the **Default scaling** option and set the target CPU utilization level.
      1. Click **Add**.

   1. If necessary, configure additional cluster settings:

      **Deletion protection**: Manages cluster protection from accidental deletion by a user.

      Enabled protection will not prevent a manual connection to a cluster to delete data.

   1. Click **Create cluster**.

- {{ TF }}

      {% include [terraform-definition](../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}

   To create a cluster:

   1. Using the command line, navigate to the folder that will contain the {{ TF }} configuration files with an infrastructure plan. Create the directory if it does not exist.

   
   1. If you don't have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and create a configuration file with provider settings](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   1. Create a configuration file describing the [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) and [subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).

      The cluster is hosted on a cloud network. If you already have a suitable network, you don't need to describe it again.

      Cluster hosts are located on subnets of the selected cloud network. If you already have suitable subnets, you don't need to describe them again.

      Example structure of a configuration file that describes a cloud network with a single subnet:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_vpc_network" "<network name in {{ TF }}>" { name = "<network name>" }

      resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "<subnet name in {{ TF }}>" {
        name           = "<subnet name>"
        zone           = "<availability zone>"
        network_id     = yandex_vpc_network.<network name in {{ TF }}>.id
        v4_cidr_blocks = ["<subnet>"]
      }
      ```


   1. Create a configuration file with a description of the [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) to be granted access to the cluster as well as a description of the [static key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/access-key.md) and [{{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) to store jobs and results.

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_iam_service_account" "<name of service account in {{ TF }}>" {
        name        = "<service account name>"
        description = "<service account description>"

        secret_key = yandex_iam_service_account_static_access_key.<static key name in {{ TF }}>.secret_key
      }
      ```

   1. Create a configuration file with a description of the cluster and its subclusters.

      If necessary, you can also use it to specify the [properties of cluster components, jobs, and the environment](../concepts/settings-list.md).

      Sample structure of a configuration file that describes a cluster consisting of a subcluster with a master host, a data storage subcluster, and a data processing subcluster:

      {% include [deletion-protection-limits](../../_includes/mdb/deletion-protection-limits-db.md) %}

      {% include [note-light-weight-cluster](../../_includes/data-proc/note-light-weight-cluster.md) %}

      {% note tip %}

      To use the most recent image version, set the `version_id` parameter value to `2.0`.

      {% endnote %}

      To access {{ dataproc-name }} [component web interfaces](../concepts/interfaces.md), add a `ui_proxy` field to the cluster description:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_dataproc_cluster" "<cluster name in {{ TF }}>" {
        ...
        ui_proxy            = <enable UI Proxy: true or false>
        ...
      }
      ```

      To configure [autoscaling](../concepts/autoscaling.md) for data processing subclusters, add a section called `autoscaling_config` with the required settings to the description of the relevant `subcluster_spec` subcluster:

      ```hcl
      subcluster_spec {
        name = "<subcluster name>"
        role = "COMPUTENODE"
        ...
        autoscaling_config {
          max_hosts_count        = <maximum number of VMs in group>
          measurement_duration   = <load measurement interval (seconds)>
          warmup_duration        = <VM warmup time (seconds)>
          stabilization_duration = <stabilization interval (seconds)>
          preemptible            = <use preemptible VMs: true or false>
          cpu_utilization_target = <target vCPU workload, %>
          decommission_timeout   = <VM decommissioning timeout (seconds)>
        }
      }
      ```

      For more information about resources you can create using {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/dataproc_cluster).

   1. Check the {{ TF }} configuration files for errors:

      {% include [terraform-validate](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/validate.md) %}

   1. Create a cluster:

      {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

      {% include [explore-resources](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/explore-resources.md) %}

- API

   To create a cluster, use the API [create](../api-ref/Cluster/create) method and pass the following in the request:

   * ID of the folder to host the cluster, in the `folderId` parameter.
   * The cluster name in the `name` parameter.
   * Cluster configuration in the `configSpec` parameter, including:
      * [Image version](../concepts/environment.md), in the `configSpec.versionId` parameter.

         {% include [note-light-weight-cluster](../../_includes/data-proc/note-light-weight-cluster.md) %}

         {% note tip %}

         To use the most recent image version, specify `2.0`.

         {% endnote %}

      * Component list, in the `configSpec.hadoop.services` parameter.
      * Public portion of the SSH key, in the `configSpec.hadoop.sshPublicKeys` parameter.
      * Subcluster settings, in the `configSpec.subclustersSpec` parameter.
   * Cluster availability zone, in the `zoneId` parameter.
   * Service account ID, in the `serviceAccountId` parameter.
   * Bucket name, in the `bucket` parameter.
   * Cluster security group IDs, in the `hostGroupIds` parameter.
   * Cluster deletion protection settings in the `deletionProtection` parameter.

      {% include [Deletion protection limits](../../_includes/mdb/deletion-protection-limits-data.md) %}

   To assign a public IP address to all subcluster hosts, pass the `true` value in the `configSpec.subclustersSpec.assignPublicIp` parameter.

   
   To create a cluster deployed on [groups of dedicated hosts](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md), pass a list of host group IDs in the `hostGroupIds` parameter.

   {% include [Dedicated hosts note](../../_includes/data-proc/note-dedicated-hosts.md) %}


   To use [initialization scripts](../concepts/init-action.md) for the initial configuration of cluster hosts, specify them in the `config_spec.hadoop.initialization_actions[]` parameter.

{% endlist %}

After your cluster's status changes to **Running**, you can [connect](connect.md) to subcluster hosts using the specified SSH key.

### Creating a lightweight cluster for Spark and PySpark jobs {#creating-a-light-weight-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   Create a {{ dataproc-name }} cluster to run Spark jobs without HDFS and data storage subclusters and set the test characteristics:

   * Cluster name: `my-dataproc`.
   * With a bucket named `dataproc-bucket`.
   * In the `{{ zone-id }}` availability zone.
   * With a service account named `dataproc-sa`.
   * With image version `2.0`.
   * With `SPARK` and `YARN` components.
   * With the SSH key's public part path: `/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
   * With the `master` subcluster for master hosts and a single `compute` subcluster for processing data:

      * Of the `{{ host-class }}` class.
      * With a network SSD storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`) of 20 GB.
      * In the `{{ subnet-name }}` subnet.
      * With public access.

   * In the security group `{{ security-group }}`.
   * With protection against accidental cluster deletion.

   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-dp }} cluster create my-dataproc \
      --bucket=dataproc-bucket \
      --zone={{ zone-id }} \
      --service-account-name=dataproc-sa \
      --version=2.0 \
      --services=SPARK,YARN \
      --ssh-public-keys-file=/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
      --subcluster name="master",`
                  `role=masternode,`
                  `resource-preset={{ host-class }},`
                  `disk-type={{ disk-type-example }},`
                  `disk-size=20,`
                  `subnet-name={{ subnet-name }},`
                  `assign-public-ip=true \
      --subcluster name="compute",`
                  `role=computenode,`
                  `resource-preset={{ host-class }},`
                  `disk-type={{ disk-type-example }},`
                  `disk-size=20,`
                  `subnet-name={{ subnet-name }},`
                  `assign-public-ip=true \
      --security-group-ids={{ security-group }} \
      --deletion-protection=true
   ```
