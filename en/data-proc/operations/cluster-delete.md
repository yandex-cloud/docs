# Deleting clusters

You can delete a cluster along with all the data stored in it. Note that data backups are not created automatically: if you want to save data for cluster recovery or future use, you can do that, for example, using [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](https://cloud.yandex.ru/services/storage).

## Before deleting a cluster {#before-you-delete}

[Disable deletion protection](./cluster-update.md) for the cluster if it is enabled.
