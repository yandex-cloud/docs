# Logging

{{ sf-name }} automatically captures an application's standard output streams and sends them to the centralized logging system available in {{ yandex-cloud }}. In addition to the application run history, the system logs request execution events.

Additional messages are logged using standard language constructs:

1. `Console.Write`: Outputs a message to the standard output stream, `stdout`.
