# Using the SDK

The runtime doesn't have a pre-installed library that lets you access the [{{ yandex-cloud }} API](../../../api-design-guide/). To use the library, add a [dependency](dependencies.md) to your application. See the library's source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/dotnet-sdk).

[Software development kits (SDK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) let you interact with {{ yandex-cloud }} services using the [service account](../../operations/function-sa.md) specified in the function.
