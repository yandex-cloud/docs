# Managing dependencies

{% note info %}

This section describes the functionality that is only available in the `python37-preview` runtime environment.

{% endnote %}

{{ sf-name }} can automatically install dependencies necessary for a function to run. To do this, when creating a new [function version](../../operations/function/version-manage.md#func-version-create), it executes the `pip install` command in the project root (folder with the function).

To specify the necessary function libraries, list them in the `requirements.txt` file. For more information about the `requirements.txt` file format, see the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files).

Sample `requirements.txt` file:

    ```
    boto3==1.13.15
    attrs=19.3.0
    ```

The dependency installation process has some restrictions. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/limits.md). You can view the dependency installation log using the link that appears in the list of operations.
