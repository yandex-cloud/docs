# Logging

{{ sf-name }} automatically captures standard application output streams and sends them to the centralized logging system available in Yandex.Cloud. In addition to the application run history, the system logs request execution events.

Additional messages are logged using standard language constructs:

1. `console.log`: Outputs a message to the standard output stream, `stdout`.
1. `console.error`: Outputs a message to the standard error stream, `stderr`.
1. `console.time` / `console.timeLog`: Outputs the action duration.
