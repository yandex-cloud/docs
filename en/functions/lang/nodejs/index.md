# Development on Node.js. Overview

With {{ sf-name }}, you can run applications written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/). The service provides several [runtime environments](../../concepts/runtime/index.md) with different versions:

| Name | Node.js version | {{ yandex-cloud }} <br>SDK version | Operating <br>system | Preloaded |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| nodejs12 | 12.22.10 | 1.3.3 | Ubuntu 18.04 LTS | No |
| nodejs14 | 14.19.0 | 1.3.3 | Ubuntu 18.04 LTS | No |
| nodejs16 | 16.14.1 | None | Ubuntu 18.04 LTS | Yes |

{% note info %}

Function behavior in preloaded and normal runtime environments may differ. Review the features of function behavior in [{#T}](../../concepts/runtime/preload-runtime.md).

{% endnote %}

Some runtime environments have an SDK library installed by default to work with the {{ yandex-cloud }} API. For more information about how to use the SDK, see [Using the SDK](sdk.md).

When creating a new [function version](../../concepts/function.md#version), {{ sf-name }} automatically installs all declared dependencies required for the function to run. For more information about requirements and restrictions, see [{#T}](dependencies.md).

The runtime environment automatically loads your code and invokes the [request handler](handler.md) you specified. It receives an incoming request and the [invocation context](context.md) as arguments. The context contains additional information about the function parameters.

{{ sf-name }} automatically captures standard application output streams and sends them to the centralized logging system available in {{ yandex-cloud }}. This system also logs service records about the start and end of each function and any errors that occur during its execution. For more information about the log format, see [{#T}](logging.md).
