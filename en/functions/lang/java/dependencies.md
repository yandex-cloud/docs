# Building and managing dependencies

{{ sf-name }} supports two ways to manage dependencies: automatic installation using `Maven` and manual delivery of dependencies along with the source code.

### Maven

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a system for managing dependencies in `Java`.

To deliver dependencies using `Maven`, just upload your own `Maven` project by configuring dependencies in `pom.xml`. No other actions are required.

If you want to set the order of loading dependencies, upload a file named `classpath.txt` to the project root. This file lists the dependencies one by one in the required order.

{% note warning %}

Make sure the project archive root contains the `pom.xml` file.

{% endnote %}

### Manual delivery of dependencies

To configure dependencies manually, place the `jar` archives of the necessary libraries in the root of the project archive.

The process of installing dependencies has resource and execution time limits. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/limits.md). You can view the dependency installation log using the link that appears in the list of operations.
