# Request handler

_A request handler_ is a method used to handle each function invocation. When creating a function version, you should specify the entry point. It consists of the name of the class that contains the handler (for example, `org.example.Handler`).

At any given time, a single function instance processes only one request. This lets you use global variables without having to provide data integrity control.

Depending on the programming model, the handler can accept and return different data. For more information about this and available ways to set the request handler, see the [Java programming model](model/index.md).
