# Developing in Bash. Overview

With {{ sf-name }}, you can run applications written in [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

The [Bash runtime](../../concepts/runtime/index.md#runtimes) has the following utilities pre-installed:

| Name | Purpose |
|----|----|
| [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) | For working with JSON. |
| [YC CLI](../../../cli) | For working with the {{ yandex-cloud }} API. |
| [AWS CLI version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html) | For using AWS-compatible services. |

For more information about how to use the SDK, see [Using the SDK](sdk.md).

The runtime environment automatically loads and invokes the specified [request handler](handler.md) for each request. The request content is passed to the script via the standard input stream, `stdin`.

{{ sf-name }} automatically captures the script's standard output stream, `stdout`, and interprets it as a response to the request. The standard error output stream, `stderr`, is sent to the centralized logging system available in {{ yandex-cloud }}. This system also logs service records about the start and end of each function and any errors that occur during its execution. For more information about the log format, see [{#T}](logging.md).
