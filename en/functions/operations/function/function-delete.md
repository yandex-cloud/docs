- {{ TF }}

   {% include [terraform-definition](../../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}

   For more information about {{ TF }}, [see our documentation](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   To delete a function created using {{ TF }}:

   1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and delete the fragment with the function description.

      Example function description in the {{ TF }} configuration:

      ```
       resource "yandex_function" "test-function" {
           name               = "test-function"
           description        = "Test function"
           user_hash          = "first-function"
           runtime            = "python37"
           entrypoint         = "main"
           memory             = "128"
           execution_timeout  = "10"
           service_account_id = "<service account ID>"
           tags               = ["my_tag"]
           content {
               zip_filename = "<path to ZIP archive>"
           }
       }
      ```

      For more information about the `yandex_function` resource parameters, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/function).

   1. Check the configuration using this command:

      ```
      terraform validate
      ```

      If the configuration is correct, you will get this message:

      ```
      Success! The configuration is valid.
      ```

   1. Run this command:

      ```
      terraform plan
      ```

      The terminal will display a list of resources with parameters. No changes are made at this step. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Apply the configuration changes:

      ```
      terraform apply
      ```
   1. Confirm the changes: type `yes` into the terminal and press **Enter**.

   You can verify that you have deleted the function in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or using the [CLI](../../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

   ```
   yc serverless function list
   ```

- API

   To delete a function, use the [delete](../../functions/api-ref/Function/delete.md) REST API method for the [Function](../../functions/api-ref/Function/index.md) resource or the [FunctionService/Delete](../../functions/api-ref/grpc/function_service.md#Delete) gRPC API call.

- {{ yandex-cloud }} Toolkit

   You can delete a function using the [{{ yandex-cloud }} Toolkit plugin](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/ide-plugin-jetbrains/blob/master/README.en.md) for the IDE family on the [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) [IntelliJ platform](https://www.jetbrains.com/opensource/idea/).
