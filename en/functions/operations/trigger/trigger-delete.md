- API

   You can delete a trigger using the [delete](../../triggers/api-ref/Trigger/delete.md) API method.

- {{ TF }}

   For more information about {{ TF }}, [see the documentation](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   {% include [terraform-definition](../../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}

   To delete a trigger created using {{ TF }}:

   1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and delete the fragment with the trigger description.

      Example trigger description in the {{ TF }} configuration:

      ```hcl
      ...
      resource "yandex_function_trigger" "my_trigger" {
        name        = "some_name"
        description = "any description"
        timer {
          cron_expression = "* * * * ? *"
        }
        function {
          id = "tf-test"
        }
      }
      ...
      ```

   1. In the command line, go to the directory with the {{ TF }} configuration file.

   1. Check the configuration using the command:

      ```
      terraform validate
      ```

      If the configuration is correct, the following message is returned:

      ```
      Success! The configuration is valid.
      ```

   1. Run the following command:

      ```
      terraform plan
      ```

      The terminal will display a list of resources with parameters. No changes are made at this step. If the configuration contains errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Apply the configuration changes:

      ```
      terraform apply
      ```

   1. Confirm the changes: type `yes` into the terminal and press **Enter**.

      You can verify the changes using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or the [CLI](../../../cli/quickstart.md) command below:

      ```
      yc serverless trigger list
      ```
