# Timer

_Timer_ is a [trigger](index.md) that runs a function on a schedule. The schedule is entered as a [cron expression](#cron-expression). The cron expression uses Coordinated Universal Time, [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).

## Cron expression format {#cron-expression}

The order of fields in the cron expression: `Minutes Hours Day-of-month Month Day-of-week Year`.

### Possible field values {#field-and-value}

{% note info %}

Special characters used, as well as the names of months and days of the week, are case-insensitive: `MON` is equivalent to `mon`.

{% endnote %}

| Field <br>name. | Required <br>field | Acceptable <br>values | Special <br>characters <br>supported |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `Minutes` | Yes | 0-59 | `,`, `-`, `*`, `/` |
| `Hours` | Yes | 0-23 | `,`, `-`, `*`, `/` |
| `Day of month` | Yes | 1-31 | `,`, `-`, `*`, `?`, `/`, `L`, `W` |
| `Month` | Yes | 1-12, <br>JAN-DEC | `,`, `-`, `*`, `/` |
| `Day of week` | Yes | 1-7, <br>SUN-SAT | `,`, `-`, `*`, `?`, `/`, `L`, `#` |
| `Year` | No | empty, 1970-2099 | `,`, `-`, `*`, `/` |

### Special characters {#special-characters}

You can use the following special characters in the cron expressions:

* `*` — Select all values in the field.

    > The `*` character in the `Minutes` field: the trigger starts `every minute`.

* `?` — Select any field value. You cannot fill `Day of month` and `Day of week` at the same time. If you entered a value in one of these fields, enter `?` in the other field.

    > `10` in `Day of month` and `?` in `Day of week`: the trigger is launched every 10th day of the month.

* `` — Select a range of values.

    > The `10-12` range in `Hours`: the trigger runs at 10 a.m., 11 a.m., and at noon.

* `,` — Select multiple values.

    > `MON, WED, FRI` in the `Day of week` field: The trigger runs on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

* `/` — Increment the value.

    > `0/15` in the `Minutes` field: The trigger starts at 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes past each hour.

* `L` — This character functions differently in the two fields where it's used:
    * In the `Day of month` field, it means the last day of the month.
    * In the `Day of week` field, it means the last day of the week, `7` (Saturday, `SAT`).

    > `L` in the `Day of month` field: The trigger runs on January 31, February 28, and so on.

* `W` — Select the weekday nearest to the specified date.

    > `15W` in the `Day of month` field: The trigger is run on the weekday nearest to the 15th day of the month. If the 15th day is Saturday, the trigger runs on Friday the 14th.

    {% note info %}

    The characters `L` and `W` in the `Day of month` field can be also merged into `LW`: The trigger is run on the last weekday of the month.

    {% endnote %}

* `#` — Select the Nth day of the month.

    > The value `6#3` in the `Day of week` field: The trigger runs on the third Friday of the month (6 — Friday, 3 — the third Friday of the month).

### Examples of cron expressions {#examples}

| Cron expression | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `* * * * ? *` | The trigger is run every minute. |
| `0 * ? * * *` | The trigger is run every hour. |
| `15 10 ? * * *` | The trigger is run every day at 10:15 a.m. |

## Roles required for the timer to run correctly {#roles}

- To create a timer, you need a permission for the service account that runs the timer executing the operation. This permission is included in the roles [iam.serviceAccounts.user](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#sa-user), [editor](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#editor), and higher.
- To run a timer, the service account needs the `{{ roles-functions-ivoker }}` role for the folder containing the function called by the timer.

## Timer message format {#timer-format}

After the trigger is activated, it sends the following message to the function:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "event_metadata": {
        "event_id": "a1s41g2n5g0o5p778k4r",
        "event_type": "yandex.cloud.events.serverless.triggers.TimerMessage",
        "created_at": "2019-12-04T12:05:14.227761Z",
