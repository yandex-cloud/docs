# Trigger for budgets that invokes a {{ sf-name }} function

[Trigger](../trigger/) for [budgets](../../../billing/concepts/budget.md) calls a {{ sf-name }} [function](../function.md) when threshold values are exceeded.

A trigger for budgets needs a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) to call the function.

For more information about creating a trigger for budgets, see [{#T}](../../operations/trigger/budget-trigger-create.md).

## Roles required for the proper operation of a trigger for budgets {#roles}

* To create a trigger, you need a permission for a service account that runs the trigger executing the operation. This permission is included in the [iam.serviceAccounts.user](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles#sa-user) and [editor](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles#editor) roles and higher.
* For the trigger to fire, the service account requires the `serverless.functions.invoker` role for the function invoked by the trigger.

## Format of the message from the trigger for budgets {#format}

After the trigger is activated, it sends the following message to the function:

{% include [budget-format](../../../_includes/functions/budget-format.md) %}
