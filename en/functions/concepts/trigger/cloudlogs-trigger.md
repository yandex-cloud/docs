A trigger for {{ cloud-logs-name }} runs a function when messages are received in a log group. The trigger must be in the same folder as the log groups it is subscribed to.

{% note alert %}

Triggers for {{ cloud-logs-name }} may skip messages under increased load. To make sure you don't lose them, in the trigger settings for {{ cloud-logs-name }}, specify [DLQ](../dlq.md) and process messages from there with a [trigger for {{ message-queue-short-name }}](ymq-trigger.md).

{% endnote %}

A trigger for {{ cloud-logs-name }} needs a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) to call the function.

For more information about creating a trigger for {{ cloud-logs-name }}, see [{#T}](../../operations/trigger/cloudlogs-trigger-create.md).

## Batching {#batching}

Batching settings let you simultaneously send multiple messages to a function. They set a top limit on the size of a message group and its accumulation time. For example, if the size of a message group is 3, the function can receive groups that contain from 1 to 3 messages.

## Roles required for the proper operation of a trigger for {{ cloud-logs-name }} {#roles}

- To create a trigger, you need a permission for a service account that runs the trigger executing the operation. This permission is included in the [iam.serviceAccounts.user](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#sa-user) and [editor](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#editor) roles and higher.
- To run a trigger, the service account needs the `{{ roles-functions-ivoker }}` role for the folder containing the function called by the trigger.
