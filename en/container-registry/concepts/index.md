# Concepts {{ container-registry-full-name }}

Yandex Container Registry is a service for storing and distributing Docker images.

It allows you to manage the following objects:

* [Docker image](docker-image.md)
* [Registry](registry.md)
* [Repository](repository.md)

The service supports [Docker Registry HTTP API V2](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/), so you can run commands available in the Docker CLI.
