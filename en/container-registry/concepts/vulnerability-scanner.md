# Vulnerability scanner

Vulnerability scanner is a service that enables you to statically analyze a [Docker image](docker-image.md) and compare its contents with the [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) vulnerability databases.

Vulnerability scanner only works with Docker images from {{ container-registry-name }}. At the same time, you can scan Docker images that you have access to as a user.

For scanning, a Docker image is unpacked, and a search is performed for installed package versions (deb). The package versions identified are then checked against a database of known vulnerabilities.

Currently, Docker images are available and built for the following supported operating systems:
* Debian 7
* Debian 8
* Debian 9
* Debian 10
* Debian 11
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Ubuntu 20.04
* Ubuntu 20.10
* Ubuntu 21.04
* Ubuntu 21.10
* Ubuntu 22.04
