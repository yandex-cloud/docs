# {{ sf-full-name }} triggers

A {{ sf-name }} [trigger](../../functions/concepts/trigger/index.md) launches a [function](../../functions/concepts/function.md) when certain events occur with a {{ container-registry-name }} [Docker image](docker-image.md). The trigger must be in the same cloud as the [registry](registry.md) whose events it's subscribed to.
