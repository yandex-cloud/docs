# Questions and answers about {{ container-registry-name }}

#### Why is the `latest` tag missing or why is it assigned to a Docker image that wasn't the last one pushed? {#latest}

The reason is that you specified a different [tag](../concepts/docker-image.md#version) when pushing the [Docker image](../concepts/docker-image.md).

The Docker client assigns the `latest` tag automatically if the Docker image is created and pushed without a tag. You can also specify the `latest` tag explicitly.

{% include [latest-info](../../_includes/container-registry/info-about-latest.md) %}

#### How do I make a registry public? {#public-registry}

You can issue the [container-registry.images.puller](../security/index.md) role for your [registry](../concepts/registry.md) to the [allUsers](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md) system group.

{% note alert %}

This makes all images in the registry available without [authentication](../operations/authentication.md).

Don't assign the `container-registry.images.pusher`, `editor` or `admin` roles to the system group for the registry. This will enable anyone with your registry ID to use the registry.

#### I encountered an error. What should I do? {#error}

See [{#T}](../error/index.md). It lists common errors and ways to solve them.

{% include [logs](../../_qa/logs.md) %}

#### What does the "Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock" error mean? {#permission-denied}

You're not running commands as a `root` user.

You can use `sudo` or configure [non-root access](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

#### How do I diagnose Credential Helper performance? {#cred-helper}

* Check under which OS user and on which host the CLI commands are run. This must be the user that the Credential Helper is configured for and on whose behalf the `yc container registry configure-docker` command was run. The corresponding line must appear in the file `/home/<user>/.docker/config.json`. If you are working on a virtual machine, make sure you have the Credential helper configured there as well.
* Check if the Credential Helper is displayed in `PATH` when running commands. During authentication in {{ container-registry-name }} using the Credential Helper, Docker accesses the `docker-credential-yc` binary file. Make sure this binary file is available in `PATH` for the user working with Docker. For example, if Docker is used with `sudo`, then `configure-docker` must be run with `sudo`, too. You can check this with the `echo {{ registry }} | docker-credential-yc get` command or with `echo {{ registry }} | sudo docker-credential-yc get` if you're running commands with `sudo`. If everything is working, you'll get a response in the format `{"Username":"iam","Secret":"***<iam-token>***"}`.
* If the commands run in interactive mode but fail in non-interactive mode, check the `.bashrc` file. The `yc` and `docker-credential-yc` programs are installed in a directory that is not usually available in the default `PATH`. In this case, the following lines are added to the `.bashrc` file:

   ```
   # The next line updates PATH for {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI
   if [ -f '/home/<user>/yandex-cloud/path.bash.inc' ]; then source '/home/<user>/yandex-cloud/path.bash.inc'; fi
   ```

   The top section of the `.bashrc` file contains a condition preventing its commands from running non-interactively. That's why the commands can run when connecting to the VM manually, but fail to run when doing so via SSH.
