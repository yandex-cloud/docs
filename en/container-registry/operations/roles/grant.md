# Assigning a role for a resource

To provide access to a [resource](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/resources-with-access-control.md), assign a user a [role](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) to the resource itself or a resource from which access privileges are inherited, such as a [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) or a [cloud](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud). For more information, see [{#T}](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md).

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you wish to assign a role for a resource.
  1. In the list of services, select **{{ container-registry-name }}**.
  1. Assign a role for the resource.
     * Assigning roles for a [registry](../../concepts/registry.md):
       1. To the right of the desired registry name, click ![horizontal-ellipsis](../../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **Registry ACL**.
       1. In the resulting window, select a group, a user, or a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) and click **Add**.
       1. In the **Permissions** drop-down list, select the desired roles.
       1. Click **Save**.
     * Assigning roles for a [repository](../../concepts/repository.md):
       1. Select the desired repository.
       1. To the right of the repository name, click ![horizontal-ellipsis](../../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **Configure ACL**.
       1. In the resulting window, select a group a user, or a service account and click **Add**.
       1. In the **Permissions** drop-down list, select the desired roles.
       1. Click **Save**.

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. Choose a role from the [list](../../security/index.md#service-roles).
  1. Assign the role:
     * To add the role to the existing permissions, run the command:

       
       ```bash
       yc <service name> <resource> add-access-binding <resource name>|<resource id> \
         --role <role id> \
         --subject userAccount:<user id>
       ```



     * To add the role and delete all the existing permissions, run the command:

       
       ```bash
       yc <service name> <resource> set-access-bindings <resource name>|<resource id> \
         --role <role id> \
         --subject userAccount:<user id>
       ```



     Where:
     * `<service name>`: Name of a `container` service.
     * `<resource>`: Category of the resource (`registry` or `repository`).
     * `<resource name>`: Name of the resource that the role is assigned for. You can specify a resource by its name or ID.
     * `<resource id>`: ID of the resource that the role is assigned for.
     * `<role id>`: ID of the role.
     * `<user id>`: ID of the group, user, or service account that is assigned the role.

     > Example. Add the role `container-registry.admin` for the registry with the ID `crp0pmf1n68dh715tf02` to the user with the ID `kolhpriseeioo9dc3v24`:
     >

     
     > ```bash
     > yc container registry add-access-binding crp0pmf1n68dh715tf02 \
     >   --role container-registry.admin \
     >   --subject userAccount:kolhpriseeioo9dc3v24
     > ```



- API

  Use the method `updateAccessBindings` for the resources `registry` and `repository`.

- {{ TF }}

  If you don't have {{ TF }}, [install it and configure the provider {{ yandex-cloud }}](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

  1. Describe in a configuration file:
     * The parameters of the `yandex_container_registry_iam_binding` resource to assign a role to the registry:
       * `registry_id`: ID of the registry to which a role is being assigned. You can retrieve the registry ID from the [folder registry list](../registry/registry-list.md#registry-list).
       * `role`: Role ID.
       * `members`: ID of the user, group, or service account the role is being assigned to.

       > Example configuration file structure:
       >

       
       > ```yaml
       > resource "yandex_container_registry_iam_binding" "puller" {
       >   registry_id = "<registry id>"
       >   role        = "<role id>"
       >
       >   members = [
       >      "userAccount:<user id>",
       >  ]
       > }
       > ```



       For more information about the `yandex_container_registry_iam_binding` resource, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/container_registry_iam_binding).
     * `yandex_container_repository_iam_binding` resource parameters to assign a role to a repository:
       * `repository_id`: ID of the repository to which a role is being assigned.
       * `role`: Role ID.
       * `members`: ID of the user, group, or service account the role is being assigned to.

       > Example configuration file structure:
       >

       
       > ```yaml
       > resource "yandex_container_repository_iam_binding" "pusher" {
       >   repository_id = "<repository id>"
       >   role          = "<role id>"
       >
       >   members = [
       >     "userAccount:<user id>",
       >  ]
       > }
       > ```



       For more information about the `yandex_container_repository_iam_binding` resource, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/container_repository_iam_binding).
  1. Run the check using the command:

     ```bash
     terraform plan
     ```

     The terminal will display a list of resources with parameters. This is a test step. No resources are created. If the configuration contain errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

     {% note alert %}

     You will be charged for all the resources created with {{ TF }}. Check the plan carefully.

     {% endnote %}

  1. Apply the configuration changes:

     ```bash
     terraform apply
     ```

  1. Confirm the resource change: enter `yes` in the terminal window and press **Enter**.

     You can check that the role has been assigned using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or the [{{ yandex-cloud }} CLI](../../../cli/quickstart.md) command:
     * Registry:

       ```bash
       yc container registry list-access-bindings <registry id>/<registry name>
       ```

     * Repository:

       ```bash
       yc container repository list-access-bindings <repository id>/<repository name>
       ```

{% endlist %}
