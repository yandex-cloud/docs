# Deleting a registry

{% note info %}

You can only delete an empty registry. Don't forget to [delete Docker images from the registry](../docker-image/docker-image-delete.md) before performing the operation.

{% endnote %}

To access a [registry](../../concepts/registry.md), use its ID or name. For information on how to find the registry ID or name, see [Getting information about existing registries](registry-list.md).
