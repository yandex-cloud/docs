- API

   To delete a policy, use the [Delete](../../api-ref/grpc/lifecycle_policy_service.md#Delete) method for the [LifecyclePolicyService](../../api-ref/grpc/lifecycle_policy_service.md) resource. In the `lifecycle_policy_id` parameter, specify a policy ID.

   You can retrieve a list of policies using the [List](../../api-ref/grpc/lifecycle_policy_service.md#List) method for the [LifecyclePolicyService](../../api-ref/grpc/lifecycle_policy_service.md) resource.
