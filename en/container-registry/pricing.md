# Pricing for {{ container-registry-name }}

{% if product == "cloud-il" %}

{% endif %}

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

{% include [currency-choice](../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}

## What goes into the cost of using {{ container-registry-name }} {#rules}

The cost of {{ container-registry-name }} usage is based on:
* The amount of storage used by your data.
* The amount of outgoing traffic.

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### Using storage {#rules-storage}

Storage usage is measured in GB per month. The volume of data stored during a month is the average value over the month based on granulated per-second data. The minimum billable unit is 1 hour of storing 1 MB of data.

{% note warning %}

If multiple Docker images in the same registry use the same layers, you aren't charged repeatedly for storing each reused layer. A layer's [digest](concepts/docker-image.md#version) indicates whether the layer is unique.

{% endnote %}

## Pricing {#prices}

### Data storage {#prices-storage}

The cost of 1 GB per month is fixed and doesn't depend on the number of days in the month. The storage cost per day is higher for shorter months and lower for longer months.

Example of proportional calculation: let's say the user stores 15 GB of data for 11.5 hours during a 30-day month. The total cost of storage can be calculated using the formula:

```
Storage_cost = Cost_per_GB_per_month * 15 * 12 / 24 / 30
```
