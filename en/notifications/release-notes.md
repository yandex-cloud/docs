# {{ cns-name }} release notes

## Q3 2025 {#q3-2025}

Implemented [topics](concepts/topics.md) to centrally send notifications to multiple endpoints.

In {{ cns-name }}, the topics format is compatible with the [Amazon SNS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/welcome.html).

For examples of commands for topics, refer to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and the [step-by-step guide](operations/index.md#topics) sections.

## Q1 2025 {#q1-2025}

* Added the option to send push notifications to browsers and progressive web applications ([PWAs](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Прогрессивное_веб-приложение)). Browser integration is available in the management console, CLI, API, and SDK.

   For more information, see [{#T}](concepts/browser.md).

* You can now set up push notifications for the [RuStore](https://www.rustore.ru/help/users/about-rustore) platform from the management console. The previously available options were the CLI, API, and SDK.

  The examples will be available after you create a channel on the page with its settings.

## Q4 2024 {#q4-2024}
