## Introduction

This Cloud.IL Systems Supplier LTD (hereinafter – "Cloud.IL Systems") Code of Conduct (hereinafter - "Code") includes the business principles to be followed by all counterparties, including consultants, agents, distributors and other individuals or entities working for any company (or with any company) that is part of Cloud.IL Systems (hereinafter - "suppliers").

We expect that our suppliers will inform all employees and subcontractors that shall interact with Cloud.IL Systems about the contents of this Code.

Cloud.IL Systems is committed to the highest standards of business ethics. Therefore, this Code shall be treated as inextricably linked with the Cloud.IL Systems Code of Business and Corporate Conduct and that Cloud.IL Systems commits to in order to be a reliable and honest partner for their suppliers. We are committed to building mutually beneficial relationships based on openness and mutual respect. We want to have common views and intentions with our partners, including benefiting society and caring about the environment.

## Key principles


### 1. Fair and honest business practices

**Competition** 

Our suppliers must aim to maintain an open, honest, and pro-competitive environment in compliance with applicable anti-monopoly laws. They do not tolerate unfair competition, avoid entering deals that restrict competition, including agreements on market-sharing based on territory, product volume or range, where both buyers and sellers are involved. Our supplier shall not share confidential information with our competitors or use other anti-competition practices.

**Anti-corruption**

Corruption is a criminal offense in all countries where Cloud.IL Systems operates. We strictly prohibit any form of corruption: bribes, payoffs, and other illegal payments to gain or maintain entrepreneurial advantages.   

We select our counterparties impartially, taking into account the competitiveness of provided prices, quality of products or services, and reliability of future supply. We never offer or accept any kinds of illegal or inappropriate payments, gifts, or services. We prohibit such actions, even if in certain Cloud.IL Systems regions of presence such payments are considered acceptable. Our suppliers shall keep in mind that local customs and practices are not an excuse for a criminal offense. 

Our suppliers, their affiliated companies, their employees, representatives and other persons involved in relationships with Cloud.IL Systems may not offer, give, request, or accept money, valuable gifts, services or other payments in order to maintain entrepreneurial advantages or receive more favorable treatment from or on behalf of Cloud.IL Systems. 

If our suppliers suspect an actual or possible violation of the principles set out in this section, they shall immediately report their suspicions to Cloud.IL Systems. To do this, they must send an email to: [hotline@ethics.online](mailto:hotline@ethics.online).

* They comply with local customs and business rules.

* The receiver won't feel obligated to give a return gift.

* They are not extorted by the receiver.

Cloud.IL Systems has approval procedures that we follow when giving or receiving gifts and hospitality.

We never accept any money or cash equivalents (such as gift certificates or e-money cards), regardless of their nominal value, from our business partners.
