# Privacy Policy for Employees, Job Candidates and Former Employees

This Privacy Policy ("**Policy**") is designed to provide Nebius employees, job candidates and former employees ("**Data Subjects**") with information on the processing of their personal data (any information relating to them) in the context of employment relations between Data Subjects and Nebius.

This Policy is based on the provisions of applicable data protection laws, including Protection of Privacy Law 5741-1981 and the Privacy Protection (Data Security) Regulations 5777-2017.

## 1. Owner

Nebius Israel Ltd (94 Yigal Alon Street, 1 Alon Tower, 39 floor, Tel Aviv) ("**Nebius**") is an owner with regard to personal data processed under this Policy. It means that Nebius independently determines the purposes and means of processing of Data subjects' personal data.

Data Subjects can contact Nebius on any questions relating to the processing of their personal data under this Policy by email at [privacy@nebius-israel.com](mailto:privacy@nebius-israel.com), or any other method approved by Nebius and available to the Data Subject.

## 2. Personal Data processing

1. Nebius processes Data Subjects' personal data based on the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the Data Subject prior to entering into a contract. In particular, this is the case when (1) Nebius processes its employees' personal data for the purpose of the performance of contractual obligations under the employment agreement, as well as its conclusion, modification, and termination; and (2) a job candidate applies for a position which is currently available at Nebius as part of the recruitment procedure, and Nebius processes his/her personal data in order to negotiate with such job candidate, check his/her qualification and suitability for a position, make an employment decision and conclude an employment agreement with the successful job candidate.

2. Nebius processes personal data under this Policy when it is necessary for compliance with its legal obligations, namely in accordance with applicable laws.

3. Nebius processes personal data based on its legitimate interest where it overrides the interests/rights of the Data Subject, taking into consideration his/her reasonable expectations. In particular, this is the case when: (1) Nebius directly contacts the Data Subject in order to discuss potential employment with the use of public contact information, and (2) Nebius checks the Data Subject's suitability for a position as part of the conflict and independence check. The legitimate interests of Nebius consist of ensuring effective management of HR relations between Nebius and Data Subject, recruitment of qualified employees who have no legal obstacles to work at Nebius and protecting our statutory rights and interests. Data Subjects can get more information on the legitimate interests pursued by Nebius and relevant balancing tests by sending a request using the contact details specified in section 1 of this Policy.

4. Apart from the purposes mentioned above in this section 2 and where required by law, Nebius will process Data Subjects' personal data based on their valid consent to the processing of personal data. In particular, Nebius always requests the Data Subject's consent to place his/her CV in the personnel reserve.

If applicable data protection laws allow processing of certain personal data only on the basis of your consent or other specific legal ground, we will obtain such consent or respective legal ground. If the above description in this section 2 remains relevant only in part it is compatible with requirements of applicable data protection laws.
