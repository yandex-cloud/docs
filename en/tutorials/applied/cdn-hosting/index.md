You can create an infrastructure for a static website in a bucket with CDN access using one of these tools:
* [Management console, CLI, API](console.md): Create your infrastructure step by step from the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console, CLI, or API.
* [{{ TF }}](terraform.md): Streamline creating and managing your resources using the _Infrastructure as Code_ (IaC) approach. Download a {{ TF }} configuration example from the GitHub repository and then deploy your infrastructure using the [{{ yandex-cloud }} {{ TF }} provider]({{ tf-docs-link }}).
