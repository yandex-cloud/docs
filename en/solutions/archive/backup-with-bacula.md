# Backup to {{ objstorage-full-name }} via Bacula on Centos 7

In these instructions, you'll learn how to create backups in {{ objstorage-full-name }} and recover data via [Bacula](https://www.bacula.org/) on CentOS 7 in the Yandex.Cloud infrastructure.

Bacula consists of several components:

* **Bacula Director**: Controls the backup and recovery process.
* **File Daemon**: Provides access to backup files.
* **Storage Daemon**: Reads and writes files to the hard disk.
* **Catalog**: Maintains the file catalog used for backups. The catalog is stored in an SQL database.
* **Bacula Console**: A management console for interacting with Bacula Director.

To back up and recover your data via Bacula:

1. [Before you start](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create a VM](#create-vm).
1. [Install Bacula and the additional components](#install-bacula).
1. [Configure MariaDB](#configure-db).
1. [Configure backup storage](#configure-storage).
1. [Configure the Bacula components](#configure-bacula).
1. [Create a backup](#run-backup).
1. [Check the backup](#check-backup).
1. [Run the recovery process](#run-restore).
1. [Check the recovered data](#check-restore).

If you no longer need the backup or recovered data, [delete all related resources](#clear-out).

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

{% include [prepare-register-billing](../_solutions_includes/before-begin.md) %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost for backup and recovery includes:

* A fee for a continuously running VM (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing)).
* A fee for data storage (see [{{ objstorage-full-name }} pricing](../../storage/pricing)).
* A fee for using a dynamic or static external IP address (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing)).

## Creating VMs {#create-vm}

To create a VM:

1. On the catalog page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the VM: `bacula-vm`.

1. Select an [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to host the VM in.

1. Under **Public images**, click **Select**. Select a public **CentOS 7** image.

1. Under **Computing resources**, select:
    * **Platform**: Intel Cascade Lake.
    * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 20%.
    * **vCPU**: 2.
    * **RAM**: 2 GB.

1. In the **Network settings** section, select the network and subnet to connect the VM to. If you don't have a network or subnet, create them right on the VM creation page.

1. In the **Public address** field, leave the **Auto** value to assign a random external IP address from the Yandex.Cloud pool, or select a static address from the list if you reserved one in advance.

1. Specify data required for accessing the VM:

    - Enter the username in the **Login** field.

    - Under **SSH key**, paste the contents of the public key file.

       You need to create a key pair for the SSH connection yourself. Learn [how to connect to VMs via SSH](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md).

     {% note alert %}

     The IP address and host name (FQDN) to connect to the VM are assigned on VM creation. If you selected **No address** in the **Public address** field, you won't be able to access the VM from the internet.

     {% endnote %}

1. Click **Create VM**.

Creating the VM may take several minutes.

When the VM is created, it is assigned a public IP address and hostname (FQDN). This data can be used for SSH access.

## Create a bucket {#create-bucket}

To create a bucket for backups in {{ objstorage-name }}:

1. Go to the Yandex.Cloud [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and select the folder where you want to perform the operations.

1. On the folder page, click **Create resource** and select **Bucket**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the bucket: `bacula-bucket`.

1. In the **Bucket access** field, select **Restricted**.

1. In the **Storage class** field, select **Cold**.

1. Click **Create bucket**.

## Create a service account {#create-service-account}

Create a [service account](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) and [assign it the role](../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa) `editor`.

## Create static access keys {#create-access-key}

Create [static access keys](../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md).

Make sure to immediately save the `key_id` ID and `secret` secret key. You will not be able to get the key value again.

## Set up the AWS CLI {#configure-aws}

After `bacula-vm` switches to `RUNNING`:

1. You can learn the IP address of the VM under **Network** on the VM page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM over SSH. You can use the `ssh` tool in Linux and macOS or [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) for Windows.

    The recommended authentication method when connecting over SSH is using a key pair. Don't forget to set up the created key pair: the private key must match the public key sent to the VM.

1. Install the yum repository:

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum install epel-release -y
    ```

1. Install `pip`:

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum install python-pip -y
    ```

1. Install the AWS CLI:

    ```bash
    $ sudo pip install awscli --upgrade
    ```

1. Set up the AWS CLI:

    ```bash
    $ sudo aws configure
    ```

    The command will request values for parameters:
    * `AWS Access Key ID`: Enter the `key_id` ID that you received when [creating the static key](#create-access-key).
    * `AWS Secret Access Key`: Enter the `secret` key that you received when [creating the static key](#create-access-key).
    * `Default region name`: `ru-central1`.
    * `Default output format`: `json`.

1. Check that the `/root/.aws/credentials` file contains the correct `key_id` and `secret` values:

    ```bash
    $ sudo cat /root/.aws/credentials
    ```

1. Check that the `/root/.aws/config` file contains the correct `Default region name` and `Default output format` values:

    ```bash
    $ sudo cat /root/.aws/config
    ```

## Install Bacula and additional components {#install-bacula}

1. Install the Bacula components:

    ```

1. Check that MariaDB is running:

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl status mariadb | grep Active
    ```

1. Enable MariaDB to run at system startup:

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl enable mariadb
    ```

1. Create database tables and configure access rights:

    ```bash
    $ /usr/libexec/bacula/grant_mysql_privileges
    $ /usr/libexec/bacula/create_mysql_database -u root
    $ /usr/libexec/bacula/make_mysql_tables -u bacula    
    ```

1. Configure the database security parameters:

    ```bash
    $ sudo mysql_secure_installation
    ```
    * `Enter current password for root (enter for none)`: Press Enter to skip the field.
    * `Set root password? [Y/n]`: Enter `Y`, set the root password, and confirm it. You will need the password in the next step.
    * `Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]`: Press Enter to accept the default value.
    * `Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]`: Press Enter to accept the default value.
    * `Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]`: Press Enter to accept the default value.
    * `Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]`: Press Enter to accept the default value.

1. Log in to the DB command line and enter the `root` password created in the previous step:

    ```bash
    $ mysql -u root -p
    ```

1. Create the password `bacula_db_password` for the `bacula` user:

    ```bash
    UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('bacula_db_password') WHERE User='bacula';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    exit
    ```

1. Enable the MySQL library for Bacula:

    ```bash
    $ sudo alternatives --config libbaccats.so
    ```

    Enter `1` to select MySQL:

    ```
      Selection    Command

    *+ 3           /usr/lib64/libbaccats-postgresql.so
    
    Enter to keep the current selection[+], or type selection number: 1
    ```

## Configure backup storage {#configure-storage}

### Prepare a backup folder {#prepare-folder}

1. Create the `/tmp/bacula` backup folder:

    ```bash
    $ sudo mkdir /tmp/bacula
    ```

1. Configure access rights to `/tmp/bacula`:

    ```bash
    $ sudo chown -R bacula:bacula /tmp/bacula
    $ sudo chmod -R 700 /tmp/bacula  
    $ sudo semanage permissive -a bacula_t 
    ```

### Mount the bucket to the file system {#mount-bucket}

Mount the bucket to the file system to upload copied files to {{ objstorage-name }}:

1. Mount the bucket using `s3fs`:

    ```bash
    $ sudo s3fs bacula-bucket /tmp/bacula -o url=https://storage.yandexcloud.net -o use_path_request_style -o allow_other -o nonempty -o uid=133,gid=133,mp_umask=077
    ```
    * `bacula-bucket`: The name of the bucket in {{ objstorage-name }}.
    * `uid=133`: The ID of the `bacula` user from the `/etc/passwd` file.
    * `gid=133`: The ID of the `bacula` group from the `/etc/passwd` file.

1. Check the access rights for the `/tmp/bacula` folder:

    ```bash
    $ sudo ls -la /tmp/bacula/
    ```

    The command output should look as follows:

    ```
    drwx------.  2 bacula bacula        31 Sep 18 09:16 .
    drwxrwxrwt. 10 root   root         265 Sep 18 08:59 ..
    ```

1. Check that the `bacula` user can create files in the `/tmp/bacula` folder:

    1. Temporarily enable the `bash` shell for the `bacula` user:

        ```bash
        $ sudo sed -i "/^bacula/ s@/sbin/nologin@/bin/bash@" /etc/passwd 
        ```

    1. Create an arbitrary file in the `/tmp/bacula` folder:

        ```bash
        $ sudo runuser -l  bacula -c 'touch /tmp/bacula/test.test' 
        ```

    1. Make sure that the file `test.test` was created in the `/tmp/bacula` folder:

        ```bash
        $ sudo ls -la /tmp/bacula | grep test.test 
        ```

    1. On the catalog page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), open **Object Storage**. Make sure the file `test.test` is visible in the `bacula-bucket` bucket.

    1. Delete the test file:

        ```bash
        $ sudo runuser -l  bacula -c 'rm -f /tmp/bacula/test.test' 
        ```

    1. Disable the `bash` shell for the `bacula` user:

        ```bash
        $ sudo sed -i "/^bacula/ s@/bin/bash@/sbin/nologin@" /etc/passwd 
        ```

## Configure Bacula components {#configure-bacula}

### Configure Bacula Director {#configure-director}

1. Open the Bacula Director configuration file:

    ```bash
    $ sudo nano /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
    ```

1. In the `Director` configuration block, add the line `DirAddress = 127.0.0.1` to set up a connection with Bacula Director:

    ```
    Director {                            # define myself
      Name = bacula-dir
      DIRport = 9101                # where we listen for UA connections
      QueryFile = "/etc/bacula/query.sql"
      WorkingDirectory = "/var/spool/bacula"
      PidDirectory = "/var/run"
      Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
      Password = "@@DIR_PASSWORD@@"         # Console password
      Messages = Daemon
      DirAddress = 127.0.0.1
    }    
    ```

1. For your convenience, rename the task `BackupClient1` to `BackupFiles`:

    ```
    Job {
      Name = "BackupFiles"
      JobDefs = "DefaultJob"
    }
    ```

1. In the `RestoreFiles` task configuration, add the line `Where = /tmp/bacula-restores` to make `/tmp/bacula-restores` a folder for restored files:

    ```
    Job {
      Name = "RestoreFiles"
      Type = Restore
      Client=bacula-fd
      FileSet="Full Set"
      Storage = File
      Pool = Default
      Messages = Standard
      Where = /tmp/bacula-restores
    }
    ```

1. Under the `FileSet` configuration section named `Full Set` under `Include`:
    * Add the `compression = GZIP` line to the `Options` section to enable compression during backup.
    * Specify `File = /` to back up the entire file system.

    ```
	FileSet {
	  Name = "Full Set"
	  Include {
		Options {
		  signature = MD5
		  compression = GZIP
		}
		File = /
	  }
	  Exclude {
		File = /var/spool/bacula
		File = /tmp
		File = /proc
		File = /tmp
		File = /.journal
		File = /.fsck
	  }
	}
    ```

1. You can find the internal IP address of the VM under **Network** on the VM page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

1. In the `Storage` configuration block, enter the internal IP address of the VM in the `Address` field to set up a connection with Storage Daemon:

    ```
    Storage {
      Name = File
    # Do not use "localhost" here
      Address = <VM internal IP address> # N.B. Use a fully qualified name here
      SDPort = 9103
      Password = "@@SD_PASSWORD@@"
      Device = FileStorage
      Media Type = File
    }
    ```

1. To connect to the DB, in the `Catalog` configuration block, enter the database password `dbpassword = "bacula_db_password"` created when [configuring MariaDB](#configure-db):

    ```
    # Generic catalog service
    Catalog {
      Name = MyCatalog
    # Uncomment the following line if you want the dbi driver
    # dbdriver = "dbi:postgresql"; dbaddress = 127.0.0.1; dbport =
      dbname = "bacula"; dbuser = "bacula"; dbpassword = "bacula_db_password"
    }
    ```

1. Save the file.

1. Check that the `bacula-dir.conf` file doesn't contain any syntax errors:

    ```bash
    $ sudo bacula-dir -tc /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
    ```

    If there aren't any error messages, the configuration is correct.

### Configure Storage Daemon {#configure-storage-daemon}

1. Open the Storage Daemon configuration file:

    ```bash
    $ sudo nano /etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf
    ```

1. You can find the internal IP address of the VM under **Network** on the VM page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

1. In the `Storage` configuration block, enter the internal IP address of the VM in the `SDAddress` field to set up a connection with Storage Daemon:

    ```
    Storage {                             # definition of myself
      Name = BackupServer-sd
      SDPort = 9103                  # Director's port
      WorkingDirectory = "/var/spool/bacula"
      Pid Directory = "/var/run/bacula"
      Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20
      SDAddress = <VM internal IP address> 
    }
    ```

1. In the `Device` configuration block, specify the `Archive Device = /tmp/bacula` folder for backups:

    ```
    Device {
      Name = FileStorage
      Media Type = File
      Archive Device = /tmp/bacula 
      LabelMedia = yes;                   # lets Bacula label unlabeled media
      Random Access = Yes;
      AutomaticMount = yes;               # when device opened, read it
      RemovableMedia = no;
      AlwaysOpen = no;
    }
    ```

1. Save the file.

1. Check that the `bacula-sd.conf` file doesn't contain any syntax errors:

    ```bash
    $ sudo bacula-sd -tc /etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf
    ```

    If there aren't any error messages, the configuration is correct.

### Create passwords for Bacula components {#create-bacula-passwords}

Bacula Director, Storage Daemon, and File Daemon use passwords for inter-component authentication.

To set passwords for Bacula components:

1. Generate passwords for Bacula Director, Storage Daemon, and File Daemon:

    ```bash
    $ DIR_PASSWORD=`date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 33`
    $ SD_PASSWORD=`date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 33`
    $ FD_PASSWORD=`date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 33`
    ```

1. Put the passwords in the configuration files:

    ```bash
    $ sudo sed -i "s/@@DIR_PASSWORD@@/${DIR_PASSWORD}/" /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
    $ sudo sed -i "s/@@DIR_PASSWORD@@/${DIR_PASSWORD}/" /etc/bacula/bconsole.conf
    $ sudo sed -i "s/@@SD_PASSWORD@@/${SD_PASSWORD}/" /etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf
    $ sudo sed -i "s/@@SD_PASSWORD@@/${SD_PASSWORD}/" /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
    $ sudo sed -i "s/@@FD_PASSWORD@@/${FD_PASSWORD}/" /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf

1. Wait for the recovery to complete and exit Bacula Console:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

## Check the recovery {#check-restore}

1. Make sure that the `/tmp/bacula-restores` folder now contains the recovered data:

    ```bash
    $ sudo ls -la /tmp/bacula-restores
    ```

    The command output should look as follows:

    ```bash

    ```

1. Make sure that the `ping` utility is in the `/tmp/bacula-restores` folder:

    ```bash
    $ sudo ls -la /tmp/bacula-restores/bin/ping
    ```

    The command output should look as follows:

    ```bash
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 66176 Aug  4  2017 /tmp/bacula-restores/bin/ping
    ```

1. Copy the `ping` utility to the main file system:

    ```bash
    $ sudo cp /tmp/bacula-restores/bin/ping /bin/ping
    ```

1. Make sure that `ping` works:

    ```bash
    $ sudo ping 127.0.0.1 -c 1
    ```

    The command output should look as follows:

    ```bash
    PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.016 ms
    
    --- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.016/0.016/0.016/0.000 ms
    ```

1. Delete a copy of recovered files to free up disk space:

    ```bash
    $ sudo rm -rfd /tmp/bacula-restores/*
    ```

## How to delete created resources {#clear-out}

To stop paying for data storage, delete the [VM](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md) and [{{ objstorage-name }} bucket](../../storage/operations/buckets/delete).

If you reserved a static public IP address specifically for this VM:

1. Open the **Virtual Private Cloud** in your folder.
2. Go to the **IP addresses** tab.
3. Find the address you need, click ![ellipsis](../../_assets/options.svg), and select **Delete**.
