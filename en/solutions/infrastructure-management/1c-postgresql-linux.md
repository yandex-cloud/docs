# Creating a cluster of 1C:Enterprise Linux servers with {{ mpg-name }}

{{ yandex-cloud }} lets you create PostgreSQL clusters optimized for 1C:Enterprise. To configure the use of 1C:Enterprise, you need to create a working server, a license server, and a {{ mpg-name }} cluster. For 1C servers to run correctly, you should disable security services on them. Therefore the cluster will be accessed via an encrypted OpenVPN server connection, while the 1C servers will have no access to the internet. The 1C servers will be running CentOS 8. The 1C cluster will be configured using the Windows administration console.

{% note info %}

To use 1C:Enterprise, you need a license. For more information about licenses and their installation, see the [1C:Enterprise website](https://its.1c.ru/).

{% endnote %}

To configure 1C:Enterprise servers:

1. [Before you start](#before-you-begin).
1. [Prepare the infrastructure](#prepare).
1. [Create a VM for the 1C:Enterprise server](#create-1c-vm).
1. [Create a VM for the license server](#create-1c-license-vm).
1. [Create a {{ mpg-name }} cluster](#create-pg-cluster).
1. [Set up a Samba server](#set-up-samba).
1. [Install the 1C:Enterprise server](#setup-1c-server).
1. [Set up a Samba server for the license server](#set-up-samba-for-license-server).
1. [Install the 1C:Enterprise server for the license server](#setup-1c-license-server).
1. [Set up a server cluster](#setup-cluster).
1. [Set up an infobase](#setup-infobase).
1. [Connect to the infobase](#connect-to-infobase).

If you no longer need the created resources, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

Before deploying the server, you need to sign up for {{ yandex-cloud }} and create a billing account:

{% include [prepare-register-billing](../_solutions_includes/prepare-register-billing.md) %}

If you have an active billing account, you can create or select a folder to run your VM in from the [Yandex.Cloud page](https://console.cloud.yandex.com/cloud).

[Learn more about clouds and folders](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md).

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The infrastructure support cost for 1C-Enterprise in {{ yandex-cloud }} includes:

* A fee for the disks and continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for the continuously running {{ mpg-name }} cluster (see [pricing for {{ mpg-full-name }}](../../managed-postgresql/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a dynamic or static external IP address (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).

## Prepare the infrastructure {#prepare}

1. Make sure that you install the 1C:Enterprise client to check the performance of the infobase and the 1C administration console to manage the server cluster on your computer.
1. Make sure you have a VM running in your cloud with [OpenVPN configured](../routing/openvpn.md) for a secure connection to the 1C servers.

{% note info %}

You can download the necessary distributions from the [1C:Enterprise website](https://its.1c.ru/).

## Create a VM for the 1C:Enterprise server {#create-1c-vm}

To create a VM:

1. On the folder page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.

2. In the **Name** field, enter the VM name: `server-1c`.

3. Select the [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to host the VM in.

4. Under **Images from {{ marketplace-name }}**, click **Select**. Select a public **CentOS 8** image.

5. Under **Computing resources**:
    - Choose a [platform](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md).
    - Specify the number of vCPUs and amount of RAM:
       * **vCPU**: 4.
       * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 100%.
       * **RAM**: 4 GB.

6. In the **Network settings** section, select the network and subnet to connect the VM to. If you don't have a network or subnet, create them right on the VM creation page.

7. In the **Public address** field, leave the value **No address**. The VM will be accessed via the OpenVPN server.

8. Specify data required for accessing the VM:

    - Enter the username in the **Login** field.

    - In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the public key file.

      You need to create a key pair for the SSH connection yourself. [Learn how to connect to VMs via SSH](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md).

9. Click **Create VM**.

Creating the VM may take several minutes.

## Create a VM for the license server {#create-1c-license-vm}

Install the 1C:Enterprise license on a separate server. This way changes to the configuration of other servers won't affect the installed license.

To create a VM:

1. On the folder page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.

2. In the **Name** field, enter the VM name: `licensing-server-1c`.

3. Select the [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to host the VM in.

4. Under **Images from {{ marketplace-name }}**, click **Select**. Select a public **CentOS 8** image.

5. Under **Computing resources**:
    - Choose a [platform](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md).
    - Specify the number of vCPUs and amount of RAM:
       * **vCPU**: 4.
       * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 100%.
       * **RAM**: 4 GB.

6. In the **Network settings** section, select the network and subnet to connect the VM to. The VM should be created in the same subnet as the OpenVPN server.

7. In the **Public address** field, leave the value **No address**. The VM will be accessed via the OpenVPN server.

8. Specify data required for accessing the VM:
    - Enter the username in the **Login** field.
    - In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the public key file.

9. Click **Create VM**.

Creating the VM may take several minutes.

## Create a cluster {{ mpg-name }} {#create-pg-cluster}

{{ yandex-cloud }} lets you create {{ mpg-name }} clusters optimized for 1C:Enterprise. Cluster settings may vary depending on your project requirements.

To create a {{ mpg-name }} cluster optimized for 1C:

1. On the folder page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **{{ mpg-name }} cluster**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter the cluster name: `1c-pg`.

1. In the **Version** list, select `10-1c`.

1. Under **Host class**, select **s2.small**.

1. Under **Storage size**, enter **local-ssd** and 100 GB.

1. Under **Database**, enter:
    - **DB name**: `1c-database`.
    - **Username**: `user1`.
    - **Password**: The password you'll use to access the database.
    - **Network**: The network where the cluster will reside.
    - **Sorting locale**: `ru_RU.UTF-8`.
    - **Character set locale**: `ru_RU.UTF-8`.

1. Under **Hosts**, select different availability zones for your hosts to ensure their fault tolerance.

1. Click **Create cluster**.

Creating the DB cluster may take several minutes.

## Set up a Samba server {#set-up-samba}

[Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the `server-1c` VM via SSH.

1. Install Samba, the necessary dependencies, and the `nano` text editor:

   ```
   $ sudo yum install nano samba samba-client samba-common, net-utils
   ```

1. Disable IPv6 to avoid server conflicts. To do this, open the file `/etc/sysctl.conf `:

   ```
   $ sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
   ```

1. Add the following lines to the file:

   ```
   net.ip6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
   net.ip6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
   ```

1. Add the following lines to the file `/etc/sysconfig/network`:

   ```
   NETWORKING_IPv6=no
   HOSTNAME=server-1c
   ```

1. Configure a shared directory. Open the Samba configuration file:

   ```
   $ sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
   ```

1. Make the file look like:

   ```
   [global]
           workgroup = WORKGROUP
           server string = Samba Server%v
           netbios name = centos
           security = user
           map to guest = bad user
           dns proxy = no

   ```

1. Disable SELinux. Run `sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/selinux` to open the SELinux configuration file and edit the `SELINUX` parameter:

   ```
   SELINUX=disabled
   ```

1. Add the Samba server service to the startup script and restart it:

   ```
   $ sudo systemctl enable smb.service
   Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/smb.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/smb.service.
   $ sudo systemctl restart smb.service
