# Emergency recovery to Yandex.Cloud using Hystax Acura

You can protect your infrastructure using Hystax Acura. Hystax Disaster Recovery ensures your resources are backed up regardless of where they're located. They can be hosted in private data centers on virtual machines or physical servers, or they can be on virtual machines from a cloud service provider.

Supported platforms:

* Amazon Web Services.
* Google Cloud Platform.
* Microsoft Azure.
* Oracle Cloud.
* Alibaba Cloud.
* VMware.
* Hyper-V.
* OpenStack.
* Physical servers.

To perform disaster recovery, create an auxiliary VM with Hystax Acura in your cloud. This VM will set up and run your disaster recovery scenario. The recovery process is run by the auxiliary VM with Hystax Acura Cloud Agent. It restores your resources to Yandex.Cloud. Once you start the process, replicas are created for deploying the infrastructure. Hystax Acura Cloud Agent also backs up the disaster recovery VM.

To run a disaster recovery scenario:

1. [Before you start](#before-begin).
1. [Required paid resources](#paid-resources).
1. [Create a service account and authorized key](#create-sa).
1. [Create a VM with Hystax Acura](#create-acura-vm).
1. [Set up Hystax Acura](#setup-hystax-acura).
1. [Set up the platform](#set-up-dr-flow).
1. [Prepare and install the agents for disaster recovery](#prepare-agent).
1. [Create a disaster recovery plan](#disaster-recovery-plan).
1. [Start disaster recovery](#start-dr).

## Before you start {#before-begin}

Before deploying the server, you need to sign up for Yandex.Cloud and create a billing account:

{% include [prepare-register-billing](../_solutions_includes/prepare-register-billing.md) %}

If you have an active billing account, you can create or select a folder to run your VM in from the [Yandex.Cloud page](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/cloud).

[Learn more about clouds and folders](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md).

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

{% note info %}

Please note that the infrastructure for Hystax Acura and Hystax Acura Cloud Agent, as well as all migrated VMs, consume quotas and require payment.

* A Hystax Acura VM uses 4 vCPUs, 8 GB of RAM, and a 70 GB disk.
* A Hystax Acura Cloud Agent VM uses 2 vCPUs, 4 GB of RAM, and an 8 GB disk. A single Hystax Acura Cloud Agent VM can serve up to 6 replicated disks at the same time. If there are more than 6 disks, additional Hystax Acura Cloud Agent VMs are created automatically.

{% endnote %}

Resource costs for Hystax Acura and Hystax Acura Cloud Agent include:

* A fee for the disks and continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for storing images (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a dynamic or static external IP address (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).

## Create a service account and authorized key {#create-sa}

[Create a service account](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) with the `editor` and `marketplace.meteringAgent` roles, and an [authorized key](../../iam/operations/authorized-key/create.md). Save the service account ID, private key ID, and the private key. You'll need them when setting up Hystax Acura.

## Create a VM with Hystax Acura {#create-acura-vm}

Create a VM with a boot disk from an `acura` image:

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   In the terminal, run the following command:

   ```
   $ yc compute instance create \
     --name hystax-acura-vm \
     --zone <availability zone> \
     --cores 4 \
     --memory 8 \ 
     --network-interface subnet-id=<subnet ID>,nat-ip-version=ipv4 \
     --create-boot-disk name=hystax-acura-disk,size=70,image-id=<Hystax Acura image ID> \
          --service-account-id <service account ID> \
     --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

{% endlist %}

## Set up Hystax Acura {#setup-hystax-acura}

1. Open the `hystax-acura-vm` VM page in the management console and find its public IP address.

1. Open the `hystax-acura-vm` VM public IP address in the browser. The Hystax Acura initial setup screen opens.

1. On the page that opens, fill in the following fields:
   - **Organization**: The name of your organization.
   - **Admin user login**: The email address for logging in to the Hystax Acura Control Panel.
   - **Password**: The administrator password.
   - **Confirm password**: Re-enter the administrator password.

1. Click **Next**.

1. Set up your Yandex.Cloud connection parameters:
   - **Service Account id**: The ID of your service account.
   - **Key id**: The ID of the authorized key of your service account.
   - **Private Key**: The private part of the authorized key of your service account.
   - **Default Folder id**: The ID of your folder.
   - **zone**: Availability zone.
   - **Hystax Service Network id**: The ID of the subnet that the `hystax-acura-vm` virtual machine is connected to.
   - **Control Panel Public IP**: The public IP address to access the Hystax Control Panel. This field is populated by the VM public IP address by default, so leave it unchanged.

1. Click **Next**.

Hystax Acura automatically checks that it can access your cloud. If everything is correct, you can now log in to the Hystax Acura Control Panel using your email address and password.
