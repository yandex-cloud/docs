# Creating a cluster of 1C:Enterprise Windows servers with MS SQL Server

To configure the use of 1C:Enterprise in {{ yandex-cloud }}, you need to create a working server, a license server, and a database server. 1C servers will be running Windows Server Datacenter 2019 and the DB server will be running MS SQL Server 2016.

{% note info %}

To use 1C:Enterprise, you need a license. For more information about licenses and their installation, see the [1C:Enterprise website](https://its.1c.ru/).

{% endnote %}

To configure 1C:Enterprise servers:

1. [Before you start](#before-you-begin).
1. [Required paid resources](#paid-resources).
1. [Prepare the infrastructure](#prepare).
1. [Create a VM for the 1C:Enterprise server and license server](#create-1c-vm).
1. [Create a VM for the infobase](#create-infobase-vm).
1. [Set up a server cluster](#setup-cluster).
1. [Set up the license server](#setup-license-server).
1. [Set up the SQL Server](#setup-sql-server).
1. [Set up the infobase](#setup-info-base).
1. [Connect to the infobase](#connect-to-infobase).

If you no longer need the created resources, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

Before deploying the server, you need to sign up for {{ yandex-cloud }} and create a billing account:

{% include [prepare-register-billing](../_solutions_includes/prepare-register-billing.md) %}

If you have an active billing account, you can create or select a folder to run your VM in from the [Yandex.Cloud page](https://console.cloud.yandex.com/cloud).

[Learn more about clouds and folders](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md).

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The infrastructure support cost for 1C-Enterprise in {{ yandex-cloud }} includes:

* A fee for the disks and continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for MS SQL Server licenses (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a dynamic or static external IP address (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).

## Prepare the infrastructure {#prepare}

1. Make sure that you install the 1C:Enterprise client to check the performance of the infobase and the 1C administration console to manage the server cluster on your computer.
1. Make sure you have a VM running in your cloud with [OpenVPN configured](../routing/openvpn.md) for a secure connection to the 1C servers.

{% note info %}

You can download the necessary distributions from the [1C:Enterprise website](https://its.1c.ru/).

## Create a VM for the 1C:Enterprise server and license server {#create-1c-vm}

Create two VMs: one for the 1C:Enterprise working server and one for the license server. Install the 1C:Enterprise license on a separate server. This way changes to the configuration of other servers won't affect the installed license.

Create two VMs for the 1C server and the license server:

1. On the folder page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.

2. In the **Name** field enter the VM name `server-1c` for the 1C:Enterprise server and `license-server-1c` for the license server.

3. Select the [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to host the VM in.

4. Under **Images from {{ marketplace-name }}**, click **Select**. Select the **Windows 2016 Datacenter** public image.

5. Under **Computing resources**:
    - Choose a [platform](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md).
    - Specify the number of vCPUs and amount of RAM:
       * **vCPU**: 4.
       * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 100%.
       * **RAM**: 8 GB.

6. Under **Network settings**, select the network and subnet to connect the VMs to. Both VMs must reside in the same subnet. If you don't have a network or subnet, create them right on the VM creation page.

7. In the **Public address** field, leave the value **No address**. The VM will be accessed via the OpenVPN server.

8. In the **Access** section **Password** field, specify the administrator's password to access the VM.

9. Click **Create VM**.

## Create a VM for the infobase {#create-infobase-vm}

The infobase will be running the MS SQL Server DBMS and be located on a separate VM.

To create an infobase VM:

1. On the folder page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.

2. In the **Name** field, enter the VM name: `mssql-1c-server`.

3. Select the [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to host the VM in.

4. Under **Images from {{ marketplace-name }}**, click **Select**. Select the **SQL Server 2016 Standard** public image.

5. Under **Computing resources**:
    - Choose a [platform](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md).
    - Specify the number of vCPUs and amount of RAM:
       * **vCPU**: 4.
       * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 100%.
       * **RAM**: 4 GB.

6. In the **Network settings** section, select the network and subnet to connect the VM to. The infobase VM must be in the same subnet as the 1C server.

7. In the **Public address** field, leave the value **No address**. The VM will be accessed via a bastion instance.

8. In the **Access** section **Password** field, specify the administrator's password to access the VM.

9. Click **Create VM**.
