#  1C-Bitrix Online Store: Site Management

[1C-Bitrix: Site Management](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%D0%A1-%D0%91%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%81:_%D0%A3%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BC) is a content management system (CMS) that lets you create an online store, corporate site, or news portal and easily manage your site structure and content.

In this tutorial, you'll deploy and configure an online store built on the 1C-Bitrix platform. During the configuration, you'll create a VM in Yandex.Cloud, deploy 1C-Bitrix on it, and launch the necessary services. You'll use a failover {{ mmy-name }} cluster as a database.

To deploy and configure 1C-Bitrix:

1. [Before you start](#before-you-begin)
1. [Create a VM in the cloud](#create-vm)
1. [Create a MySQL DB cluster](#create-mysql)
1. [Configure a server to work with 1C-Bitrix](#configure-server)
1. [Configure 1C-Bitrix](#configure-bitrix)

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

Before deploying the server, you need to sign up for Yandex.Cloud and create a billing account:

{% include [prepare-register-billing](../_solutions_includes/prepare-register-billing.md) %}

If you have an active billing account, you can create or select a folder to run your VM in from the [Yandex.Cloud page](https://console.cloud.yandex.com/cloud).

[Learn more about clouds and folders](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md).

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The infrastructure support cost for 1C-Bitrix includes:

* A fee for a continuously running VM (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a dynamic or static external IP address (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a managed MySQL database (see [pricing for {{ mmy-name }}](../../managed-mysql/pricing.md)).

## Create a VM in the cloud {#create-vm}

To create a VM:

1. Go to the desired folder from [management console]({{ link-console-main }}): click on the folder name under **Your resources**.

1. Click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the VM, such as `bitrix`.

   {% include [name-format](../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

1. Select the [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to host the VM in.  If you don't know which availability zone you need, leave the default.

1. Under **Images from {{ marketplace-name }}**, select the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS image.

1. Under **Disks**, select an SSD with 13 GB.

1. Under **Computing resources**, specify the configuration for proper operation of 1C-Bitrix:
   * **Platform**: Intel Cascade Lake.
   * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 20%.
   * **vCPU**: 2.
   * **RAM**: 4 GB.

1. Under **Network settings**:
   - Select the **Network** and **Subnet** to connect the VM to. If you don't have a network or subnet, create them right in this section.
   - In the **Public address** field, leave the **Auto** value to assign a random external IP address from the Yandex.Cloud pool, or select a static address from the list if you reserved one in advance.

1. Under **Access**, specify the information required to access the VM:
   - In the **Login** field, enter a username to create on the VM, such as `ubuntu`.
   - In the **SSH key** field, copy the value of your public SSH key. A key pair for an SSH connection should be [created on your own](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md).

1. Click **Create VM**.

## Create a MySQL database cluster {#create-mysql}

To create a MySQL database cluster:

1. On the folder page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **MySQL cluster**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the VM, such as `bitrix-mysql`.

   {% include [name-format](../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

1. Under **Host class**, select the **Type** of the host: **s2.micro**.

1. Under **Database**, enter:
   - **DB name**. Leave the default value, `db1`.
   - **Username** to connect to the database. Leave the default value, `user1`.
   - **Password** for 1C-Bitrix to access the database.

1. Under **Hosts**, change the **Availability zone** for the host. To do this, click ![pencil](../../_assets/pencil.svg) in the host line and select the appropriate availability zone in the window that opens.

   We recommend selecting the same **Availability zone** as you did when creating the VM. This reduces latency between the VM and database.

   To make the database fault-tolerant, you can add more hosts to the cluster. To do this, click **Add host**, select the availability zone and subnet, and click **Save**.

1. Make sure that no public access is requested for the cluster hosts, otherwise 1C-Bitrix won't be able to connect to the cluster.

1. Leave the other fields as they are.

1. Click **Create cluster**.

Creating the DB cluster may take several minutes.

## Configure the VM to work with 1C-Bitrix {#configure-server}

To configure the VM to work with 1C-Bitrix:

1. Log in to the VM via SSH (using `ubuntu` as the username that you set when [creating the VM](#create-vm)):

   ```bash
   $ ssh ubuntu@<VM-public-IP>
   ```

   To find out the public IP address of your VM:
   1. in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the VM was created.
   1. Select **{{compute-short-name}}**.
   1. Click on the name of your VM (`bitrix` in the example).
   1. In the window with general VM info that opens, you can find the public IP address in the **Public IPv4** field under **Network**.

1. Switch to admin mode:

   ```bash
   ubuntu@bitrix:~$ sudo -i
   root@bitrix:~#
   ```

1. Install the necessary software:

   ```bash
   root@bitrix:~# apt-get update
   root@bitrix:~# apt-get install -y apache2 libapache2-mod-php php-gd php-mbstring php-mysql
   ```

1. Go to the project's working directory:

   ```bash
   root@bitrix:~# cd /var/www/html/
   ```

1. Download the <q>1C-Bitrix: Site Management</q> distribution:

   ```bash
   root@bitrix:/var/www/html# wget https://www.1c-bitrix.ru/download/business_encode.tar.gz
   ```

1. Unpack the downloaded archive and delete unnecessary files:

   ```bash
   root@bitrix:/var/www/html# tar -zxf business_encode.tar.gz
   root@bitrix:/var/www/html# rm -f index.html business_encode.tar.gz
   ```

1. Assign the `www-data` user as the owner of the working directory of the project:

   ```bash
   root@bitrix:/var/www/html# chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
   
   # Make sure that the command worked properly.
   root@bitrix:/var/www/html# ls -l
   total 76
   drwxrwxr-x 6 www-data www-data  4096 May 15 13:50 bitrix
   -rwxrwxr-x 1 www-data www-data  1378 May 15 13:50 index.php

   ...
   ```

1. Specify the necessary PHP parameters in the configuration file `/etc/php/7.2/apache2/php.ini`

   | Previously | Now |
   | :--------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
   | short_open_tag = Off | short_open_tag = On |
   | display_errors = Off | display_errors = On |
   | memory_limit = 128M | memory_limit = 256M |
   | ;date.timezone = | date.timezone = Europe/Moscow |
   | ;opcache.revalidate_freq=2 | opcache.revalidate_freq = 0 |
   | ;mbstring.func_overload = 0 | mbstring.func_overload = 2 |

1. Configure the Apache server using the `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf` file. To do this, add the following block after the `DocumentRoot /var/www/html` line:

   ```
   <Directory /var/www/html>
     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
     AllowOverride All
     Require all granted
   </Directory>
   ```

1. Restart the Apache server to apply all the new settings:

   ```bash
   root@bitrix:/var/www/html# service apache2 restart
   ```

The server is configured for 1C-Bitrix to run properly. Now you need to configure the 1C-Bitrix system itself.
