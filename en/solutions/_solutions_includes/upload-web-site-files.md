1. Go to the VM page of the [management console](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru). In the **Network** section, find the VM's public IP address.

1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-connect-ssh.md) to the VM over SSH. You can use the `ssh` tool on Linux and macOS and [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) for Windows.

   The recommended authentication method when connecting over SSH is using a key pair.  Don't forget to set up the created key pair: the private key must match the public key sent to the VM.

1. Grant your user write access to the directory `/var/www/html`:
