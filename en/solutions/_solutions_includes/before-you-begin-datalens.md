To use {{ datalens-short-name }}, you have to sign up for Yandex.Cloud and create a billing account (without a billing account, {{ datalens-short-name }} is only available in demo mode):

{% include [prepare-register-billing](../_solutions_includes/prepare-register-billing.md) %}

When you activate your billing account, you automatically switch to the **Free** {{ datalens-short-name }} plan. By default, you can create a {{ datalens-short-name }} instance for no more than 1 folder. If you haven't done this yet:

1. Select a folder on the [Yandex.Cloud page](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/cloud).
1. Select the **DataLens** service.
1. Click **Activate DataLens**.

An instance of the service is created in the selected folder and you can go directly to the {{ datalens-short-name }} interface.
