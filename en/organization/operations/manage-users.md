# Managing user accounts

Use {{org-full-name}} to manage your employees' access to {{yandex-cloud}} services.

To provide your employees with access to the organization's services, [connect them using their Yandex](add-account.md) accounts. If your company already uses a different account management system (such as Active Directory or Google Workspace), [configure an identity federation](../concepts/add-federation.md), so that your employees can use their work accounts to access {{yandex-cloud}} services.

In {{ org-name }}, you can create an identity federation with any credential management service (identity provider) that supports the [SAML]({{ link-saml }}) protocol.

* [Add a Yandex](add-account.md) user.
* [Get the user's ID or email](users-get.md).
* [Assign access rights](add-role.md).
* [Edit or delete an employee's account](edit-account.md).
* [Remove an employee from an organization](leave-organization.md).
