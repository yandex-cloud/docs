# Managing user accounts

Use {{ org-full-name }} to manage your employees' access to {{ yandex-cloud }} services.

You can connect your employees using their [Yandex accounts](../../iam/concepts/users/accounts.md#passport), which will give them access to your [organization's](../concepts/organization.md) services.

If your company uses a different credential management system, you can [set up an identity federation](./manage-federations.md). You can also create [local users](../../iam/concepts/users/accounts.md#local) within a [user pool](../concepts/user-pools.md) and use this pool to manage user authentication in third-party services via {{ yandex-cloud }} [IdP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider).
