# Deactivating a user

To suspend a userâ€™s access to organization resources, you can deactivate the user. Deactivation will terminate all the user's sessions, and the user will lose access to the organization's resources until [reactivated](activate-user.md).

{% include [activate-deactivate-passport-user-notice](../../../_includes/organization/activate-deactivate-passport-user-notice.md) %}

## Deactivating a federated user {#deactivate-federated}

To deactivate a federated user account:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- {{ cloud-center }} UI {#cloud-center}

  {% include [deactivate-user-ui](../../../_includes/organization/deactivate-user-ui.md) %}

{% endlist %}

## Deactivating a local user {#deactivate-local}


{% include [note-preview](../../../_includes/note-preview.md) %}

To deactivate a local user account:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- {{ cloud-center }} UI {#cloud-center}

  {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

     ```bash
     yc organization-manager idp user suspend --help
     ```
  1. {% include [cli-list-userpools](../../../_includes/organization/cli-list-userpools.md) %}
  1. {% include [cli-userpool-list-users](../../../_includes/organization/cli-userpool-list-users.md) %}
  1. To deactivate a user, provide their ID in this command:

     ```bash
     yc organization-manager idp user suspend <user_ID> \
       --reason <reason_for_deactivation>

     Where `--reason` states why you want to deactivate the user. This is an optional parameter.
