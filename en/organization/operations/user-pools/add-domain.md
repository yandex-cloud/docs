# Associating a domain


{% include [note-preview](../../../_includes/note-preview.md) %}

You can associate a [domain](../../concepts/domains.md) with a [user pool](../../concepts/user-pools.md) or [federation](../../concepts/add-federation.md), which allows authentication through the [Login Discovery](../../concepts/domains.md#login-discovery) system. When authenticating, a user with your domain will be redirected to your federation or user pool.

To use a domain in a user pool or federation, domain ownership must be [verified](validate-domain.md) via a DNS record.

{% note warning %}

You can only associate each domain with one user pool or one federation.
