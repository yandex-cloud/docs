# Adding Yandex users

If your employees have Yandex accounts (for example, `{{login-example}}`), they can use them to access {{yandex-cloud}} services enabled in your organization.

{% note warning %}

The {{org-full-name}} service is running in [Preview](../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) mode. Managing organization services is unavailable.

{% endnote %}

To add employee accounts to the organization, follow these steps:

1. [Log in]({{link-passport}}) to the organization's administrator account.
1. Go to [{{org-full-name}}]({{link-org-main}}).
1. Go to the left panel and select [Users]({{link-org-users}}) ![icon-users](../_assets/organization/icon-users.png).
1. In the upper-right corner, click **Add user**.
1. Enter the email addresses of the Yandex users you want to invite to the organization (for example, `{{login-example}}`).
1. Click **Add**. This will give the users access to the organization.

To access the organization's enabled services, invited users simply need to log in to their Yandex account.
