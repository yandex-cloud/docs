# Managing clouds and services

Use {{ org-full-name }} to expand the capabilities of your business. Create a [cloud](#cloud) and connect [collaboration and business intelligence services](#collaboration).

Collaboration services and business intelligence tools are available to all organizations. To use [{{ yandex-cloud }} services]({{ link-cloud-services }}), create a cloud.

{% note info %}

All clouds and services can be managed by users with the `organization-manager.organizations.owner` role. For information on assigning roles to users, see [Roles](roles.md#admin).

{% endnote %}

To go to cloud and service management:

1. [Log in]({{link-passport}}) to the organization's administrator or owner account.

1. Go to [{{org-full-name}}]({{link-org-main}}).

1. In the panel on the left, select [Clouds and services]({{link-org-services}}) ![icon-services](../_assets/organization/icon-services.svg).

   The page displays a list of clouds connected to the organization and the following services: {{ tracker-full-name }}, {{ wiki-full-name }}, {{ forms-full-name }}, {{ datalens-full-name }}, and {{ ml-platform-full-name }}.

1. To go to a service, click the service card.

   To open a cloud in the {{ yandex-cloud }} console, click the cloud name.



## Cloud {#cloud}

A cloud is your organization's workspace. All the clouds connected to your organization are displayed in the **Clouds and services** section.

A corporate administrator can create new directories and resources in the cloud, connect {{ yandex-cloud }} services, and manage relevant access. Learn more about using {{ yandex-cloud }} resources in the [{{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation](../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md).

An organization's first cloud will connect automatically when an administrator logs in to the [{{ yandex-cloud }} console]({{ link-console-main }}). To connect an additional cloud, you need to create a [billing account](../billing/quickstart/).

If there are multiple organizations registered in your account, you can [move](../resource-manager/operations/cloud/change-organization.md) clouds between them.


## Collaboration and business intelligence services {#collaboration}

Collaboration services and business intelligence tools are available to all organizations and connect automatically when any organization user logs in for the first time.
