# Managing user accounts

Use {{ org-full-name }} to manage your employees' access to {{ yandex-cloud }} services.

To provide your employees with access to the organization's services, [connect them using their Yandex](add-account.md) accounts. If your company already uses a different account management system (such as Active Directory or Google Workspace), [configure an identity federation](add-federation.md), so that your employees can use their work accounts to access {{ yandex-cloud }} services.

In {{ org-name }}, you can create an identity federation with any credential management service (identity provider) that supports the [SAML]({{ link-saml }}) protocol.

* [Add a Yandex](add-account.md) user.
* [Configure an identity federation](add-federation.md).
* [Edit or delete an employee's account](edit-account.md).
