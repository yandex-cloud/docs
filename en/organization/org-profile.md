# Editing organization data

{% note info %}

Organization data can be edited by users with the `organization-manager.admin` or `organization-manager.organizations.owner` role. For information on assigning roles to users, see [Roles](roles.md#admin).

{% endnote %}

To edit your organization data:

1. Log in to [{{ org-full-name }}]({{ link-org-main }}) using the organization's administrator or owner account.

1. In the left panel, select [Organization information]({{ link-org-settings }}) ![icon-settings](../_assets/organization/icon-settings.svg).

1. To change the organization name and description, click **Edit data** in the upper-right corner.

1. Change the organization name, technical name, or description.

1. Click **Save**.

You cannot delete an organization on your own. If an organization is not in use, [remove](./edit-account.md) all users from it, [create]({{ link-console-support }}) a delete organization request, and submit it to the support team.
