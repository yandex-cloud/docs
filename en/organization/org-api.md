# API {{ org-full-name }}

Yandex 360 has two REST API interfaces for accessing Connect services via HTTP requests: the Directory API and the Tracker API.

Use these interfaces to integrate Yandex 360 features into your web services and applications. This way, you'll automate workflows, and your users will be able to administer the organization and work with Tracker tasks through third-party applications.
