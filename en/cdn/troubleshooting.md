# Troubleshooting in {{ cdn-name }}

Below is the list of the most frequent issues with {{ cdn-name }} and ways to resolve them.

## The CDN responds to file requests with 3xx codes (redirect) {#responses-3xx}

Check that the [resource](concepts/resource.md) settings include:

* The protocol used by the origins as the primary protocol (HTTP or HTTPS). If origins redirect requests from a URI with the `http` scheme to a URI with the `https` scheme, you must select the HTTPS protocol for the resource, and vice versa.
* The value of the HTTP `Host` header from which origins don't redirect requests.

   > For example, if the header value is configured as `www.example.com`, and the origins redirect requests with this value to `example.com`, change the value in the settings to `example.com`.

## The CDN responds to file requests with 4xx codes (client error) {#responses-4xx}

Make sure that:

* End-client access to the content is allowed in the resource settings.
* Origins return files in response to direct requests (bypassing the CDN).
* Origins allow and correctly process requests that match the resource settings:

   * Over the specified protocol: HTTP or HTTPS.
   * With the specified value of the `Host` HTTP header and other headers.

## The CDN responds to file requests with 5xx codes (server error) {#responses-5xx}

Make sure that:

* Origins respond to CDN server requests within 5 seconds.
* Origins allow and correctly process requests that match the resource settings:

   * Over the specified protocol: HTTP or HTTPS.
   * With the specified value of the `Host` HTTP header and other headers.

Also check the {{ cdn-name }} status on the [{{ yandex-cloud }} special page](https://status.cloud.yandex.com/dashboard?service=cloud%20cdn).

## Updated settings aren't applied to the resource {#changes-not-applied}

{% include [after-changes-tip](../_includes/cdn/after-changes-tip.md) %}

## A CDN resource has the Not active status and content is not available to users {#resource-not-active}

Enable the **End-user access to content** option in the basic resource settings. For more information, see the [instructions](operations/resources/configure-basics.md).
