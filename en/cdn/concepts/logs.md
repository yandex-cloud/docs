# Exporting logs

{{ cdn-name }} provides CDN server request logs and, if [origin shielding](origins-shielding.md) is enabled, requests to the shielding servers.

To export logs, you need a bucket in {{ objstorage-full-name }}. Logs are exported for all [CDN resources](resource.md).

Log export is a paid functionality. See [{#T}](../pricing.md) for billing information.
