# CORS

{{ cdn-full-name }} supports cross-domain requests through [CORS]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing){% endif %} (cross-origin resource sharing).

In the resource settings, you can:

* Allow CORS requests with any origins (the `Origin` header values): Select for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, the `*` value or use the same value as in the `Origin` header in the request.
* Allow CORS requests for specific origins: Select for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header the same value as in the `Origin` header in the request, but only if it's listed as allowed in the settings.
* Prohibit CORS requests: Disable adding the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the responses.

CORS settings apply to all files of the resource.
