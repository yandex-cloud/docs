# Getting started with {{ cdn-full-name }}

Configure content sharing via a CDN using a {{ objstorage-name }} bucket as an example:

1. [{#T}](#create-cdn-resource).
1. [{#T}](#upload-content-to-CDN).
1. [{#T}](#setup-cname).
1. [{#T}](#check-cdn-working).

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

1. Make sure that you have a domain name and can access the DNS settings on the site of the company that provides DNS hosting to you. This is usually the company that registered your domain.

1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). Then log in to {{ yandex-cloud }} or sign up if you don't have an account yet.

1. If you don't have a folder yet, create one:

   {% include [create-folder](../_includes/create-folder.md) %}

1. If you haven't activated the CDN provider, activate it:
   1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ cdn-full-name }}**.
   1. Click **Activate provider**.

1. If you don't have a {{ objstorage-name }} bucket yet:
   1. [Create a bucket](../storage/operations/buckets/create.md).
   1. [Enable public access](../storage/operations/buckets/bucket-availability.md) to the objects in the bucket and the object list.
   1. [Upload content](../storage/operations/objects/upload.md) to the bucket.

## Create a CDN resource {#create-cdn-resource}

1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ cdn-full-name }}**.

1. On the **CDN resources** tab, click **Create resource**.

1. Configure your CDN resource as follows:

   * **Content query**: Select **From one origin**.

   * **Origin type**: Select **Bucket**.

   * **Bucket**: Select the bucket created in {{ objstorage-name }}.

   * **Domain names for content distribution**: Specify the primary domain name that you will use in your website's links to content posted on the CDN. Example: `cdn.example.com`.

     {% note alert %}

     You can't change the primary domain name used for content sharing after you have created your CDN resource.

     {% endnote %}

   * In the **Advanced** section:

     1. In the **Source protocol** field, select **HTTP**.

     1. In the **Host header** field, select **Custom**.

     1. In the **Header value** field, specify the domain name from the [Bucket URL](../storage/concepts/bucket.md#bucket-url) in the format `<bucket name>.{{ s3-storage-host }}`. The schema (`http` or `https`) does not need to be specified. For example:

        ```
        my-bucket.{{ s3-storage-host }}
        ```

        {% note alert %}

        If an incorrect `Host` header is configured, {{ objstorage-name }} will return errors in response to CDN server requests.

        {% endnote %}

1. Click **Create**.

## Upload your content to the CDN {#upload-content-to-CDN}

{% note tip %}

We recommend that you preload large content to the CDN (for example, files larger than 200 MB). This is an optional step. If you skip uploading content at this point, it will be uploaded to the CDN automatically when a user tries to access it for the first time.

{% endnote %}

To preload content to CDN servers:

1. Go to the **Content** tab.

1. Click **Preload content**.

1. In the **File path** field, enter the names of the files stored in the bucket, omitting the bucket name, for example:

    ```text
    /index.html
    /static/styles.css
    /static/app.js
    ```

1. Click **Preload content**.

## Set up a CNAME record for your domain {#setup-cname}

1. On the **Overview** tab, under **DNS Settings**, copy the generated URL on the `.edgecdn.ru` domain to the clipboard.

1. Go to your domain's DNS settings on the site of your DNS hosting provider.

1. Edit the desired CNAME record for it to point to the previously copied address in the `.edgecdn.ru` domain. For example, if the domain name you specified when creating your CDN resource is `cdn.example.com`, you need to create or replace an existing record for `cdn` with the following CNAME record:

    ```http
    cdn CNAME cl-.....6bb.edgecdn.ru.
    ```

## Test the CDN {#check-cdn-working}

1. Wait until the DNS records are updated.

1. Make sure that the `cdn` CNAME record in the DNS server's cache points to the URL generated by the service (such as `cl-.....6bb.edgecdn.ru`).

1. Try opening the site's URL in the browser, for example:

    ```http
    http://cdn.example.com/index.html
    ```
