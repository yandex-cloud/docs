# Access management

In this section, you'll learn:

* [What resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [What roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [What roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

## What resources you can assign roles to {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

## What roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

The diagram shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. For example, the `editor` role includes all `viewer` role permissions. A description of each role is given under the diagram.

Active roles in the service:

* Service roles:
    * {% include [cdn.viewer](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/cdn.viewer.md) %}
    * {% include [cdn.editor](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/cdn.editor.md) %}
    * {% include [cdn.admin](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/cdn.admin.md) %}

* Primitive roles:
    * {% include [viewer](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/viewer.md) %}
    * {% include [editor](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/editor.md) %}
    * {% include [admin](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/admin.md) %}

## What roles do I need {#required-roles}

The table below lists the roles needed to perform a given action. You can always assign a role granting more permissions than the role specified. For example, you can assign `editor` instead of `viewer`.
