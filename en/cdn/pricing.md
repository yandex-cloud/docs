* The amount of outgoing traffic from CDN servers, including traffic requested by the user's {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, such as {{ compute-full-name}} [virtual machines](../compute/concepts/vm.md). The incoming traffic received by CDN servers from the {{ yandex-cloud }} services and resources or from the Internet, is not charged.

* Paid features enabled for resources, such as [origin shielding](concepts/origins-shielding.md) and [log export](concepts/logs.md).
