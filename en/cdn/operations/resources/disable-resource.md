# Disabling a resource

You can stop a resource by disabling end-user access to the content. To do this:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder your resource is hosted in.
  
  1. Select **{{ cdn-name }}**.
  
  1. On the **CDN resources** tab, click on the name of the desired resource.
  
  1. In the upper-right corner, click **Edit**.
  
  1. Under **Additional**, disable **End-user access to content**.
  
  1. Click **Save**.

{% endlist %}

{% note info %}

You can't delete a resource using the management console at the moment: to do this, please [contact support](../../../support/overview.md).

{% endnote %}
