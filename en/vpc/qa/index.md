# Questions and answers about {{ vpc-name }}

#### What is {{ vpc-short-name }}? {#what-is-vpc}

{{ vpc-short-name }} ({{ vpc-full-name }}) is a way to connect and organize cloud resources using virtual networks.

#### Which network technologies are available to {{ yandex-cloud }} users? {#available-network-techs}

{{ vpc-short-name }} allows you to assign internal and external IP addresses to VMs and create cloud networks and subnets.

#### How do I create a cloud network? {#create-cloud-network}

When you create a folder through the management console, the service will automatically create a network in it. You can also create a cloud network manually using the management console.

#### How do I create a subnet? {#create-subnet}

Subnets in the default folder will be created automatically. You can create additional subnets using the [management console or CLI](../operations/subnet-create.md).

#### What resources can be assigned IP addresses? {#assing-ip-resources}

Addresses can be assigned to [VMs](../../compute/concepts/vm.md) and hosts in database clusters.

#### How are IP addresses assigned to cloud resources? {#assign-ip}

Public IP addresses are assigned to cloud resources automatically. You can assign internal addresses automatically or manually when creating a VM.

#### How do I make a public IP address static? {#make-ip-static}

You can [make a public IP address static](../operations/set-static-ip.md) using the **IP addresses** tab of the {{ vpc-short-name }} service in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

### What if my email traffic is being blocked? {#if-traffic-blocked}

We [block](../concepts/limits.md#vpc-egress-traffic-filter) only the traffic that is sent from public IP addresses on port 25. The only exception is the traffic that is sent to the Yandex mail servers.


To unblock the traffic, configure your mail server to use the 465 and 587 ports. Set these port as a mail relay and delegate your domain to the (https://yandex.com/support/business/delegate-domain.html) the Yandex servers using [Mail for a domain](https://habr.com/company/plesk/blog/304204/).


If you need to use port 25, assign a public IP address to your VM:

1. [Request]({{ link-console-support }}) a new public IP address with an open port 25. Prepare the following information for the support:
   * ID of the folder in which the address will be used;
   * availability zone;
   * domain for the PTR record if needed.

1. Unassign the current public IP address from your VM. Run the following [CLI](../../cli/) command:

   ```bash
   yc compute instance remove-one-to-one-nat \
     --id=<ID of your VM> \
     --network-interface-index=0
   ```

1. [Assign](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-attach-public-ip.md) the new IP address, that technical support provided you with.

We still can block an IP address or stop a VM if we receive complaints on spam being sent from this address.


#### What limitations apply when creating subnets? {#create-subnet-limits}

Subnets can only use private addresses from IPv4 ranges defined by [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918).
