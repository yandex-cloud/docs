### Public IP addresses {#prices-public-ip}

A public IP address can be in one of the following two states:

1. **Active**: When a _dynamic_ or _static_ public IP address is linked to a running cloud resource.
1. **Inactive**: When a _static_ public IP address is not linked to a cloud resource or is linked to a stopped resource.


All prices are shown without VAT.






{% include [usd-ip.md](../_pricing/vpc/usd-ip.md) %}




The cost of an inactive public static address is calculated by adding the cost of a public IP address to the cost of reserving an inactive public static IP address.

For example, the cost of an inactive public static address will be:


> 
> 
> $0.001920 + $0.002480 = $0.004400
>
> Total: $0.004400 per hour.



Where:

* $0.001920 is the cost of using a public IP address per hour.
* $0.002480 is the cost of reserving an inactive public static IP address for an hour.

### Using security groups {#prices-security-groups}

The [security group](concepts/security-groups.md) functionality is at the [Preview](../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage and can be used free of charge.

Filtered traffic is incoming traffic that the DDoS Protection filtering system passes to the user's cloud resources. Only filtered traffic is charged.

For example, let's assume a user's VM was subject to a typical 10 Gbps DDoS attack generating 75 GB of incoming traffic. During the attack, the user downloaded 2 GB of filtered files from the internet to the VM. When the attack ended, the user downloaded another 2 GB of useful files.

In this case, only 4 GB of filtered traffic are charged: 2 GB that DDoS Protection passed to cloud resources during the attack, and 2 GB downloaded after the attack. Malicious traffic is filtered out and not charged.
