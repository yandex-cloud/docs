# {{ ddos-protection-full-name }} in {{ vpc-name }}

{{ ddos-protection-full-name }} is the {{ vpc-short-name }} component that safeguards cloud resources from DDoS attacks, and is provided in partnership with Qrator Labs.

Activating {{ ddos-protection-full-name }} for VM instances or network load balancers allows you to efficiently respond to attacks aiming to overwhelm the channel capacity and computing resources of your VM instances. Such attacks are characterized by a broad bandwidth and produce a large number of packets per second. They are relatively easy to set up: attackers typically send a flood of TCP SYN (SYN Flood) packets or traffic of UDP-based application protocols (such as DNS, NTP, SSDP, CLDAP, and more).

To prevent such attacks, {{ ddos-protection-name }}:
* Constantly analyzes all incoming traffic.
* Detects the anomalies mentioned above in the network and transport layers.
* Automatically diverts unwanted traffic when its intensity threatens the health of your app in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

DDoS protection is available for the public IP addresses of virtual machines, network balancers, and database hosts. It can only be enabled when you create a cloud resource or reserve a static IP address. However, there are no restrictions on working with protected IP addresses. You can make them static or reserve them. If you stop a virtual machine with a protected dynamic address, the address will change the next time it is started, but the DDoS protection will remain.

The bandwidth for abusive and legitimate traffic is not restricted. You pay for every gigabyte of legitimate traffic passed to the resource.

Please note that when you enable DDoS Protection, you should reduce [MTU and TCP MSS](../concepts/mtu-mss.md).

Please note that this service is not intended to protect websites and mobile apps from higher-level DDoS attacks that:
* Use valid TCP connections.
* Use HTTP and HTTPS requests.
* Exploit bottlenecks in the apps under attack.

You can request protection at the application level by contacting the tech support service.

## Extended protection {#advanced-protection}

Extended protection operates at levels 3 and 7 of the OSI model. You can also track loads and attack properties, and enable Soundwall WAF in your Qrator Labs account. To enable extended protection, contact your manager or the tech support service.

Please provide the following information in your request:

Service properties:
* Number of resources (sites, domains, and services) to protect.
* Enable WAF (Web Application Firewall): yes or no.
* Enable encrypted (SSL/TLS/HTTPS) service protection: with or without decryption.
* Business-critical downtime.
* Enable a dedicated channel to increase SLA: yes or no.

Legitimate traffic properties:
* Maximum incoming and outgoing application traffic.
* Maximum packet rate (PPS).
* Maximum request rate (RPS).

We also recommend providing:
* A network infrastructure diagram: site locations, uplinks, internal architecture from the boundary router to the application.
* Example traffic stats (chart screenshots) for a 24-hour period.
