# ChangeMessageVisibility

Method for setting the visibility timeout for a message that is being processed. The total timeout of a message cannot exceed 12 hours.

Example: there is a message with a visibility timeout of 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, `ChangeMessageVisibility` is called with a timeout of 10 minutes. You can extend the visibility timeout by gradually increasing the value of `MessageVisibility` until the allowed maximum is reached. If the total timeout exceeds 12 hours, the request is rejected.

If you attempt to set the visibility timeout to a value greater than the maximum time left, Message Queue returns an error.

The timeout value set for a message using `ChangeMessageVisibility` is not saved in memory forever. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value the next time the message is received.

For more information about message visibility, see [Messages](../../concepts/message.md) and [Visibility timeout](../../concepts/visibility-timeout.md).
