# DeleteMessage

Method for deleting messages from a queue. To select the message to delete, use the `ReceiptHandle` of the message. A message can be deleted even if it is received and being processed by another consumer. Message Queue automatically deletes messages if the value specified for the `RetentionPeriod` parameter is reached.

The `ReceiptHandle` is associated with a specific instance of receiving a message. If you receive a message more than once, the `ReceiptHandle` is different each time you receive a message. To delete a message, provide the most recently received `ReceiptHandle` for the message. Otherwise, the request will be successful but the message might not be deleted.

For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. Make sure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.
