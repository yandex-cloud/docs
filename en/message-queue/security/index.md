# Access management in {{ message-queue-name }}

{{ yandex-cloud }} users can only perform operations on resources that are allowed by the roles assigned to them. If the user has no roles assigned, all operations are forbidden.

To allow access to resources in {{ message-queue-full-name }}, assign the required roles to the user from the list below. Currently, a role can only be assigned to a parent resource (folder or cloud). Roles are inherited by nested resources.

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see the section [Inheritance of access rights](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-name }} documentation.

{% endnote %}

## Assigning roles {#grant-roles}

To manage message queues, the user must have the appropriate permissions in the cloud and folders where operations will be performed.

To grant the user permissions:

{% include [grant-role-console](../../_includes/grant-role-console.md) %}

## Which roles exist in the service {#roles-list}
