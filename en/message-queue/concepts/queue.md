# Message queues

Message queues enable messaging between components of distributed applications. Messages can be sent to queues using the [API](../api-ref/index.md) or any of the [supported tools](../instruments/index.md).

Enqueued messages are read by consumers, i.e., applications configured to receive messages from particular queues. Once a message is processed, the consumer deletes it from the queue.

## Standard queues {#standard-queues}

Consumers read messages from a standard queue in random order. Standard queues guarantee that each message is delivered at least once. In rare cases, a message can be received from a standard queue twice.

Use standard queues when you need maximum throughput.

## FIFO queues {#fifo-queues}

Messages are read from a FIFO queue in the order that they are received. FIFO queues guarantee exactly-once delivery.

Use FIFO queues if you need strictly ordered message delivery and exactly-once processing.

### Message groups {#group-id}

With group IDs, you can send multiple ordered message groups to different consumers within a single FIFO queue. The group ID is specified via the `MessageGroupId` parameter at sending. Within a single group, all messages are enqueued and processed in the order that they are sent.

### Deduplication on enqueueing {#deduplication}

FIFO queues deduplicate messages being enqueued by their deduplication ID or content. For more information, see [{#T}](deduplication.md).

{% note info %}

{{ message-queue-full-name }} automatically deletes messages that are in a queue beyond the retention period. The standard message retention period is 4 days. It can be changed within the range of 60 seconds to 14 days. You can change it when creating a queue or by using the [SetQueueAttributes](../api-ref/queue/SetQueueAttributes.md) method.
