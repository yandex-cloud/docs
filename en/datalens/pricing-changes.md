# Updated pricing policy for {{ datalens-full-name }}



Starting December 1, {{ datalens-full-name }} introduces a revised pricing policy. Under the new unified service plan, all users will gain access to expanded capabilities, including Neuroanalyst, reports, JavaScript-based customizations in Editor, background chart data export, UI styling, and more. The new plan will be offered free of charge for individual use and for a fee for team work.

## New pricing policy {#new-rules}

### What will change? {#changes}

Pricing will be based on the number of _seats_ within one {{ datalens-full-name }} instance.

* Every {{ datalens-full-name }} user will need a seat, even if only to view or edit dashboards.
* Seats are issued automatically when new users first log in to {{ datalens-full-name }}.
* Seats can be managed by the administrator, see [below](#manage-seats) for details.
* While you can still manage access to objects in {{ datalens-full-name }} using [roles and access permissions](./security/index.md), a seat does not provide access to objects.

### Active users and seats {#difference}

According to the [pricing policy](./pricing-old.md) valid until December 1, 2025, you pay only for _active_ {{ datalens-name }} users. An active user is someone whose actions result in a query to a data source, e.g., opening or editing a dashboard, chart, or dataset.

However, the new [pricing policy](./pricing.md), due to come into effect on December 1, 2025, is going to charge for each seat no matter whether its user is active or not.

### Managing seats {#manage-seats}

Starting December 1, the seat management option will appear in {{ datalens-name }} settings.

{% note info %}

An administrator (a user with the `datalens.admin` role) will be able to enter {{ datalens-name }} settings and manage the list of seats at any time, even without a seat. However, other {{ datalens-name }} features will not be available to the administrator without a seat.

{% endnote %}

The administrator will be able to:

* View the number of seats in the instance, including available (unassigned) ones.
* View the list of users with seats.
* Reassign seats from user to user.
* Increase or decrease the number of seats in the instance.


### Prices {#prices}

Within one instance, {{ datalens-name }} will be priced as follows:
* One seat: Free of charge.
* More than one seat: {{ sku|USD|datalens.users.v1|string }} per month per seat.

Seats are counted towards the month's total. If the instance contains more than one seat, the total charge is calculated as follows:

Number of seats × Cost per seat


You may schedule a cut in the number of seats at any time; however, the change will take effect only on the first day of the following month.

Technical support coverage is determined by the [{{ yandex-cloud }}](../support/overview.md) support plan you select.

## Transition timeline {#timeline}

The transition to the new service plan will be gradual.
