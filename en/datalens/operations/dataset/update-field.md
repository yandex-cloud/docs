# Updating fields in datasets

You should update fields when you change the schema of a table (or tables) in the data source.

{% note info %}

You can update fields for any source except CSV files.

{% endnote %}

To update fields in a dataset:

1. Open the dataset. If you don't have a dataset, [create one](create.md).
1. In the upper-left corner, select the **Fields** tab.
1. At the top of the screen, click **Update fields**.

The fields in the dataset are updated if:

* The table schema in the source changed.
* Fields were manually deleted from the dataset.
