# Creating a choropleth map

To create a choropleth map:

1. On the {{ datalens-full-name }} homepage, click **Create chart**.
1. Under **Dataset**, select a dataset to visualize. If you don't have a dataset, [create one](../dataset/create.md).
1. Select the **Choropleth map** chart type.
1. Drag a dimension with the type [`Geopolygon`](../../concepts/data-types#geopolygon) from the dataset to the **Geopolygons** section. The values are displayed as a shaded area on the map.

You can also:
