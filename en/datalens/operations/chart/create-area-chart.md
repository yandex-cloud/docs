# Creating an area chart

To create an area chart:

1. On the {{ datalens-full-name }} homepage, click **Create chart**.
1. Under **Dataset**, select a dataset to visualize. If you don't have a dataset, [create one](../dataset/create.md).
1. Select **Area chart** as the chart type.
1. Drag a dimension from the dataset to the **X** section. The values are displayed in the lower part of the chart on the X-axis.
1. Drag one or more measures from the dataset to the **Y** section. The values are displayed as chart areas on the Y-axis.
