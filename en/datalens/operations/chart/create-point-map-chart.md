# Creating a point map

To create a point map:

1. On the {{ datalens-full-name }} homepage, click **Create chart**.
1. Under **Dataset**, select a dataset to visualize. If you don't have a dataset, [create one](../dataset/create.md).
1. Select the **Point map** chart type.
1. Drag a dimension with the type [`Geopoint`](../../concepts/data-types#geopoint) from the dataset to the **Geopoints** section. The values are displayed as a shaded area on the map.
1. Set the size of the displayed points. To do this, click the icon in the **Size** section.

You can also:

* Apply a filter.
* Select a measure for the point shading intensity.
* Add tooltips from the dimension and measure values displayed when hovering over a point.
