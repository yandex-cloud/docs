# Publishing a chart

Before publishing data, make sure that:

* Your charts and dashboards don't contain any personal data or trade secrets. Access to published data is not restricted.
* You can't publish dashboards and charts built on the [Yandex Metrica API](../connection/create-metrica-api.md) and [AppMetrica](../connection/create-appmetrica.md), but you can [share](#share) them.
* You have administrator rights to published charts and dashboards, as well as related objects.

To publish a chart:

{% include [datalens-public-chart](../../../_includes/datalens/operations/datalens-public-chart.md) %}

## Share a chart based on Yandex Metrica or AppMetrica data {#share}

To share a chart containing Yandex Metrica or AppMetrica data, use one of the following methods:

{% include [datalens-metrica-appmetrica-share](../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-metrica-appmetrica-share.md) %}
