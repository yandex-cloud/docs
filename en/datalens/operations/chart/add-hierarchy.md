1. In the **Dataset** section, select a dataset to visualize. If you don't have a dataset, [create one](../dataset/create.md).
1. Select any chart type except **Map**, **Indicator**, **Tree diagram**, and **Pivot table**.
1. To the left of the wizard interface, click **![image](../../../_assets/plus-sign.svg)** and select **Add hierarchy**.
1. Enter the hierarchy name, select dimensions, and arrange them however you'd like.
1. In the lower-right corner, click **Save**.
1. Drag the created hierarchy to any available section. For example, for the **Table** chart type, the **Columns** section is available.
1. Drag other dimensions and measures to the desired sections.
