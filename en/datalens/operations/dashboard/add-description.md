# Adding a description to a dashboard

To add a dashboard description:


{% include [datalens-workbooks-collections-select-note](../../../_includes/datalens/operations/datalens-workbooks-collections-select-note.md) %}


1. In the left-hand panel, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/layout-cells-large.svg) **Dashboards** and select the dashboard you need.
1. In the top-right corner, click **Edit**.
1. At the top of the screen, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/circle-info.svg).
1. Enter the description and click **Save**.
1. In the top-right corner, click **Save**.

As a result, all users will see the ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/circle-info.svg) icon in the top-right corner of the dashboard. Clicking it opens the **Dashboard info** window with the description.

To remove the dashboard description, save an empty description in the **Dashboard info** window. As a result, the ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/circle-info.svg) icon is no longer displayed to any user.
