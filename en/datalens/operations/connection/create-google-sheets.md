{% cut "What do I do if a Google Sheets spreadsheet is not working properly?" %}

If a Google Sheets spreadsheet contains empty cells, {{ datalens-short-name }} may display column headers incorrectly and fail to display the first several lines.

To fix this, you need to fill in the empty cells in the Google Sheets spreadsheet with any appropriate values, such as `unavailable`, `none`, and `unknown`.

To complete empty cells in a Google Sheets spreadsheet quickly:

1\. Highlight the entire Google Sheets sheet.
2\. In the spreadsheet menu, select **Data** → **Create a filter**.
3\. In the right-hand corner of the first column's top cell, click the filter icon.
4\. Select **Clear** and then select **(Blanks)**.
5\. In the column's top cell, enter the desired values, such as `0`, `unavailable`, `none`, or any other.
6\. Drag the cell down to fill all the empty cells in the column with the entered value.
7\. Click the filter icon again and click **Select all**.
8\. Repeat all the steps starting with Step 3 for the other columns in the spreadsheet.
