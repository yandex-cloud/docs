# Creating an AppMetrica connection

To create an AppMetrica connection:


1. Go to the [connections page]({{ link-datalens-main }}/connections).


1. Click **Create connection**.
1. Select **AppMetrica** as the connection type.
1. Specify the connection parameters:

   * **OAuth token**. Click **Get token** or enter the [OAuth token](#get-oauth-token) manually to access the AppMetrica data.
   * **App**. Specify one or more applications to connect to.
   * **Accuracy**. Set the data accuracy (sampling rate). You can change accuracy after you create the connection.

1. Click **Create connection**.
1. Enter the name for the connection and click **Create**.

For datasets based on AppMetrica connections, the following groups of metrics are available:

- Installations
- Audience
- Client events
- Push campaigns
- Audience + social demographic


Connections to AppMetrica do not support [public access](../../concepts/datalens-public.md) to the objects created based on it. To share a dashboard or chart created based on this connection, use one of the following methods:

{% include [datalens-metrica-appmetrica-share](../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-metrica-appmetrica-share.md) %}


{% include [datalens-get-token](../../../_includes/datalens/operations/datalens-get-token.md) %}
