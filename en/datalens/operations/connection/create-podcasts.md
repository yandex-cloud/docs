# Creating a Yandex Music podcast connection


{% note warning %}

Only users with permissions to a Yandex Music podcast can create connections and process podcast analytics. If you do not have access to any podcast, no data will be displayed on the dashboard.

You will get access after uploading a podcast to Yandex Music. The podcast is linked to the Yandex email address you specified when uploading it.
