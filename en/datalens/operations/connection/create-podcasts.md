# Creating a Yandex Music podcast connection


{% note warning %}

Only users with privileges to a Yandex Music podcast are able to create connections and process podcast analytics. If you don't have access to any podcast, no data will be displayed on the dashboard.

You will get access after uploading a podcast to Yandex Music. The podcast is linked to the Yandex email address specified when uploading it.
