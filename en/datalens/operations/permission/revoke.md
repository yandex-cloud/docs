# Deleting permissions

Only a user with `Admin` permission can grant permissions to an object or directory.

To revoke directory or object permissions:

    {% include [nav-filter-note](../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-nav-filter-note.md) %}

1. Click ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) by the object or directory and select **Permissions**.

1. Select the user with the permission you want to revoke or choose the **All** group.

1. In the window that opens, click **Revoke permissions**.
