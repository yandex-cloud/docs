# Granting permissions

Only a user with `{{ permission-admin }}` access privileges can assign access rights to an object or folder: they can do so directly or by confirming a request. By default, objects inherit the access rights of the parent folder.

Before granting a user access permissions, [add](../../security/index.md#add-new-user) the user to the respective organization or cloud.

## Granting object permissions {#grant-object}

1. On the navigation page, find the relevant access object.

   {% include [nav-filter-note](../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-nav-filter-note.md) %}

1. Click ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) next to the object and select **Permissions**.
1. In the window that opens, click the button to grant connection, dataset, chart, or dashboard permissions.
1. Enter a username or select the **All** group. If necessary, write a comment for the user you're requesting access from. Specify the appropriate permissions and click **Add**.

   {% include [multi-access-note](../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-multi-access-note.md) %}

   {% endlist %}
