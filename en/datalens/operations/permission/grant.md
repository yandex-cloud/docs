# Granting permissions

Only a user with `Admin` permission can grant permissions to an object or directory. By default, objects inherit the access rights of the parent folder.

To grant permissions to directories or objects:

1. On the navigation page, find the relevant directory or access object.

    {% include [nav-filter-note](../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-nav-filter-note.md) %}

1. Click ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) by the object or directory and select**Permissions**.

1. In the window that opens, click **Add**.

1. Enter a username, select the permissions, and click **Add**.

    {% include [multi-access-note](../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-multi-access-note.md) %}
