# Window functions in {{ datalens-short-name }}

[Window functions](../function-ref/window-functions.md) are similar to aggregate functions. They allow you to get additional information about the original sample. For example, you can calculate the cumulative total and the moving average or rank values.

The difference is that when calculating window functions, the rows are not combined into one but continue to be separate. The result of the calculation is displayed in each row. The original number of rows doesn't change. For more detail on data aggregate and grouping in {{ datalens-short-name }}, please review [{#T}](aggregation-tutorial.md#datalens-aggregation).


In these examples, the [Selling.csv](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/doc-files/Selling.csv) file will be used as the source of data on sales in cities.

## Applying window functions {#usage-window-function}

In {{ datalens-short-name }} , only [measures](dataset/data-model.md#field) can be the arguments of window functions. The groups of values that a function is calculated for are specified as a list of [dimensions](dataset/data-model.md#field) and are called windows. [Groupings](#grouping) may only use the dimensions involved in building a chart. These include all the dimensions in one chart section.

Let's take a look at the `Selling` table with data on sales in cities:

| # | City | Category | Date | Sales | Profit | Day's discount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Detroit | Office Supplies | 2014-01-02 | 10 | 7 | 0.05 |
| 2 | Portland | Office Supplies | 2014-04-05 | 14 | 10 | 0.00 |
| 3 | Portland | Office Supplies | 2014-01-21 | 20 | 12 | 0.20 |
| 4 | San Francisco | Office Supplies | 2014-03-11 | 8 | 3 | 0.10 |
| 5 | Detroit | Furniture | 2014-01-01 | 12 | 3 | 0.00 |
| 6 | Portland | Furniture | 2014-01-21 | 7 | 2 | 0.05 |
| 7 | San Francisco | Technology | 2014-01-02 | 7 | 3 | 0.10 |
| 8 | San Francisco | Technology | 2014-01-17 | 13 | 5 | 0.20 |

**Example 1**

The [chart](https://datalens.yandex/ryw9h5g0ecc8k) based on the `Selling` table and grouped by `City` and `Category` must compute total sales (`TotalSales`) as well as each category's share in a city as a percentage of the total (`% Total`). To do this, you need to create two measures using the [SUM](../function-ref/SUM_WINDOW.md) window function:

* TotalSales: `SUM(SUM([Sales]) TOTAL)`
* % Total: `SUM([Sales]) / [TotalSales]`

For example, for the **Table** chart, the result looks like this:

![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-1.png)

**Example 2**

You need to arrange the rows in the `Selling` table based on the sales amount. To do this, you can use the [RANK](../function-ref/RANK.md) window function `RANK(SUM([Sales]))`. As a result, each row is assigned a sequence number: the row with the largest sales amount is 1, and the smallest is 6.

![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-2.png)

Window functions can be nested. You can also specify a custom grouping for each function used in the formula.

**Example 3**

You need to arrange the rows in the `Selling` table based on the the average sales amount for all dates in the city. You can compute an average sales amount for a city using the [AVG](../function-ref/AVG_WINDOW.md) function: `AVG(SUM([Sales]) WITHIN [City])`. City names repeat in the table, so for ranking, use the [RANK_DENSE](../function-ref/RANK_DENSE.md) function. It doesn't skip sequence numbers for rows with the same value. The resulting formula is `RANK_DENSE(AVG(SUM([Sales]) WITHIN [City]) TOTAL)`.

![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-11.png)

**Example 4**

Let's review the most complicated window function example. Let's a build a dataset from a [connection](../tutorials/data-from-ch-to-sql-chart.md#create-connection) to the demo DB (`SampleLite` table) to use as our data source. Let's build a chart of the sales statistics by product subcategory. Let's only include in the chart those subcategories that made it into the daily top 3 sellers at least once a day.

{% cut "Read more" %}

1. Let's order our product subcategories in descending order by sales amount within each date. To accomplish this, we'll use the [RANK](../function-ref/RANK.md) window function to create a metric:

   * Sales Rank: `RANK(SUM([Sales]) WITHIN [Date])`

   As a result, for each date, the subcategory with the highest total sales will be numbered `1`, the subcategory with the next highest total `2`, and so on. For convenience, let's place the data in a **Table** chart:

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-12.png)

1. Let's highlight the subcategories in the top 3 most sold for the same date. To do this, create the following metric:

   * Top-3: `IF([Sales Rank] <= 3, 1, 0)`

   The subcategories that make it into the top 3 based on sales for each date will have the `[Top-3]` metric equal to `1`whereas for the remaining categories on the same date, it will be equal to `0`.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-13.png)

1. Using the `[Top-3]` flag, we have highlighted the categories for the same date. Now, we need to highlight these subcategories for the other dates. To accomplish this, we create a metric using the [MAX](../function-ref/MAX_WINDOW.md) window function:

   * [Show Category]: `MAX([Top-3] WITHIN [Sub-Category])`

   In each product subcategory, the `[Show Category]` flag will be equal to `1` both for the date when the subcategory made it into the top 3 based on sales and for all the other dates. If a subcategory did not make it into the 3 most sold on any date, its `[Show Category]` flag will be equal to `0`.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-14.png)

1. Let's add the following filter to the chart: `[Show Category] = 1`. This will give us a list of the product subcategories that are to be displayed on the chart.

1. Let's now change our chart type to **Line chart**. Configure visualization:

   * Drag the `Date` dimension under **X**.
   * Drag the `Sales` metric under **Y**.
   * Drag the `Sub-Category` dimension  under **Colors**.
   * Under **filters**, we'll keep the filter for `Show Category` equal to `1`.
   * In the **Y** axis settings, select that **Null values** are to be **Displayed as 0**.

      ![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-15.png)

{% endcut %}


## Grouping in window functions {#grouping}

Just like aggregate functions, window functions can be calculated:

* For a [single window](#one-window-grouping).
* For [several windows](#some-window-grouping).

For more information on groupings in window functions, please review under [{#T}](../function-ref/window-functions.md#syntax-grouping).

### Grouping for a single window {#one-window-grouping}

With this grouping option, the function is calculated for a single window that includes all the rows. The `TOTAL` grouping is used. It enables you to calculate totals, rank rows, and perform other operations that require information about all the source data.

**Example**

You need to calculate the average sales amount (`AvgSales`) and deviations from it for each category in the city (`DeltaFromAvg`). The best function for this is [AVG](../function-ref/AVG_WINDOW.md):

* AvgSales — `AVG(SUM([Sales]) TOTAL)`
* DeltaFromAvg — `SUM([Sales]) - [AvgSales]`

![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-3.png)

### Grouping for multiple windows {#some-window-grouping}

Sometimes the window function needs to be calculated separately by group, and not across all records. In this case, the `WITHIN` and `AMONG` groupings are used.

#### WITHIN {#within}

`WITHIN`: Similar to `GROUP BY` in `SQL`. It lists all the dimensions by which splitting into windows is performed. In `WITHIN`, you can also use measures. In this case their values are similarly included in the window grouping.

{% note warning %}

In `WITHIN`, the [dimensions](aggregation-tutorial.md#dimensions-and-measures) that aren't included in chart grouping are ignored. For example, in a chart grouped by the `City` and `Category` dimensions for the `SUM(SUM([Sales]) WITHIN [Date])` measure, the `Date` dimension is ignored and it becomes the same as the `SUM(SUM([Sales]) TOTAL)` measure.

{% endnote %}

**Example**

Calculating the share of each category (`% Total`) of the total sales amount by city (`TotalSales`):

* TotalSales: `SUM(SUM([Sales]) WITHIN [City])`
* % Total: `SUM([Sales]) / [TotalSales]`

For example, this is the result for the **Column chart**:

![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-4.png)

#### AMONG {#among}

In this case, splitting into windows is performed for all dimensions that are included in the chart grouping but are not listed in `AMONG`. That's why this grouping type is contrary to `WITHIN`. When calculating the function, `AMONG` transforms to `WITHIN`, which performs grouping by all dimensions that are not listed in `AMONG`.

For example, for a chart with grouping by the `City` and `Category` dimensions, the following measures are the same:

* `SUM(SUM([Sales]) AMONG [Category])` and `SUM(SUM([Sales]) WITHIN [City])`
* `SUM(SUM([Sales]) AMONG [City], [Category])`and `SUM(SUM([Sales]) TOTAL)`.

This option is provided only for convenience and is used when you don't know which dimensions the chart will be built across in advance, but you need to exclude certain dimensions from the window grouping.

{% note warning %}

The dimensions listed in `AMONG` should be added to the chart sections. Otherwise, the chart returns an error.

{% endnote %}

## Sorting {#order-by}

Some window functions support [sorting](../function-ref/window-functions.md#syntax-order-by), the direction of which affects the calculation value. To specify sorting for the window function:

* Specify dimensions or measures in the `ORDER BY` section.
* In the chart, move the dimensions or measures to the **Sorting** section.

Dimensions and measures for sorting are first taken from the `ORDER BY` section in the formula and then from the **Sorting** chart section.

**Example**

You need to calculate the change in the total sales amount (`IncTotal`) for the entire period, from the earliest to the latest date. To do this, you can use the [RSUM](../function-ref/RSUM.md) function sorted by the `Date` dimension: `RSUM(SUM([Sales]) TOTAL ORDER BY [Date])`.

Result for an example **Line chart**:

![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-5.png)

You'll get a similar result if you set the `IncTotal` measure with the `RSUM(SUM([Sales]) TOTAL)` formula and add the `Date` dimension to the **Sorting** section.

## Filtering {#before-filter-by}

Function values in charts are calculated after applying [filters](chart/settings.md#filter) across the dimensions and measures added to the **Filters** section. For window functions, you can override this order. To do this, specify the necessary dimensions or measures in the `BEFORE FILTER BY` section of the formula. In this case, the function value is calculated before filtering is applied.

The calculation order is changed when you need to calculate the function value for the original dataset but the chart data is limited by the filter.

**Example**

You need to calculate the change in the total sales amount (`IncTotal`) for the period from `17.01.2014` through `11.03.2014`. If you add a `Date` filter and create the `RSUM(SUM([Sales]) TOTAL ORDER BY [Date])` measure, the function is calculated only for the data limited by the filter:

![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-6.png)

To calculate a function for all the data, but only display the result for a certain period, you need to add the `Date` dimension to the `BEFORE FILTER BY` section: `RSUM(SUM([Sales]) TOTAL ORDER BY [Date] BEFORE FILTER BY [Date])`.

![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-7.png)

## Creating measures for a window function {#create-measure}

You can't use a [dimension](dataset/data-model.md#field) directly as the first argument (`value` in the syntax description) of a window function. You should first apply an [aggregation function](../function-ref/aggregation-functions.md) to it so that a dimension becomes a [measure](dataset/data-model.md#field) that can be used in window functions.

For example, you want to rank sales records by profit over the entire period in a chart with data grouped by the `Year` and `Category` dimensions. To do this, you can't use the `RANK([Profit])` formula, where `Profit` is a dimension. You need to apply an aggregation function first to convert the `Profit` dimension into a measure. The most suitable aggregate function here is [SUM](../function-ref/SUM.md) that returns the amount of profit: `SUM([Profit])`. Next, apply the [RANK](../function-ref/RANK.md) window function to the resulting measure. The correct resulting formula is `RANK(SUM([Profit]))`.

You can add measures both at the dataset and the chart level. For details, see [{#T}](aggregation-tutorial.md#create-measure).

To understand what aggregate function to select for converting dimensions into measures, specify what resulting measure you want to get using a window function. For example, in a chart with data grouped by product `Category`, you need to order records by `Sales`. To order records by sales amount, choose the [SUM](../function-ref/SUM.md) aggregate function: `SUM([Sales])`. To order them by sales count, choose [COUNT](../function-ref/COUNT.md): `COUNT([Sales])`.

If you need to get a string measure with a value determined by grouping and sorting data in a window function, use the [ANY](../function-ref/ANY.md) aggregate function.


Let's take a look at examples of creating measures for a window function. We'll build a dataset from a [connection](../tutorials/data-from-ch-to-sql-chart.md#create-connection) to the demo DB (the `MS_SalesMiniTable` table) and use it as our data source.

**Example 1**

The output should be the sales count per day for each product category and the total number of sales per day.

1. Select the **Table** chart type. Place the `OrderDate` and `ProductCategory` dimensions in the **Columns** section.
1. To order records by sales date, add the `OrderDate` dimension to the **Sorting** section.
1. To count sales per day for each product category, add the `cnt_order_date_category` measure to your chart. Use the [COUNT](../function-ref/COUNT.md) aggregate function. It will group data by dimensions from the **Columns** section. The resulting formula is `COUNT([OrderID])`.
1. Place the `cnt_order_date_category` measure in the **Columns** section.
1. To count the total number of sales per day, add the `cnt_order_date` measure to your chart. Use the [SUM](../function-ref/SUM_WINDOW.md) window function with grouping by the `OrderDate` dimension. To convert the `OrderID` dimension into a measure, use the [COUNT](../function-ref/COUNT.md) aggregate function: `COUNT([OrderID])`. The resulting formula is `SUM(COUNT([OrderID]) WITHIN [OrderDate])`.
1. Place the `cnt_order_date_category` measure in the **Columns** section.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-measure-cnt.png)

**Example 2**

The output should be the average value of sales by shop and its product categories:

1. Select the **Table** chart type. Place the `ShopName` and `ProductCategory` dimensions in the **Columns** section.
1. To calculate the average sales value by the shop's product categories, add the `avg_category_sale` measure to your chart. Use the [AVG](../function-ref/AVG.md) aggregate function. It will group data by dimensions from the **Columns** section. The resulting formula is `AVG([Sales])`.
1. Place the `avg_category_sale` measure in the **Columns** section.
1. To calculate the average sales value by shop, add the `avg_shop_sale` measure to your chart. Use the [AVG](../function-ref/AVG_WINDOW.md) window function with grouping by the `ShopName` dimension. To convert the `Sales` dimension into a measure, use the [AVG](../function-ref/AVG.md) aggregate function: `AVG([Sales])`. The resulting formula is `AVG(AVG([Sales]) WITHIN [ShopName])`.
1. Place the `avg_shop_sale` measure in the **Columns** section.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-measure-avg.png)

**Example 3**

In this example, we'll build a dataset from a [connection](../tutorials/data-from-ch-to-sql-chart.md#create-connection) to the demo DB (the `samples.MS_SalesFullTable` table) and use it as our data source.

As a result, we should get a pivot table with the IDs of the last sales for the day by shop:

1. To group data by sales date (without time), add the `Date` field with the `DATE_PARSE(STR([OrderDatetime]))` formula to your chart.
1. To sort data by sales time, add the `Time` field with the `RIGHT(STR([OrderDatetime]),8)` formula to your chart.
1. Select the **Pivot table** chart type. Place the `ShopName`, `OrderDatetime`, and `OrderID` dimensions in the **Rows** section.
1. Add the `last_shop_order` measure to your chart. Use the [LAST](../function-ref/LAST.md) window function with grouping by `ShopName` and sorting by `Time`. To convert a string dimension into a measure, use the [ANY](../function-ref/ANY.md) aggregate function with the `INCLUDE` grouping (to output unique values): `ANY([OrderID] INCLUDE [OrderID])`. The resulting formula is `LAST(ANY([OrderID] INCLUDE [OrderID]) WITHIN [ShopName], [Date] ORDER BY [Time])`.
1. Place the `last_shop_order` measure in the **Measures** section.

## Questions and answers {#qa}

{% cut "Ordering values for a cumulative total or a rolling average calculation" %}

For functions that depend on the order of entries in the window (for example, [RSUM](../function-ref/RSUM.md), [MAVG](../function-ref/MAVG.md), [LAG](../function-ref/LAG.md), [LAST](../function-ref/LAST.md), or [FIRST](../function-ref/FIRST.md)) to work correctly, you must specify sorting. To do this:

* Drag the dimension or measure to sort the chart by to the **Sorting** section.
* Set sorting for a specific function using `ORDER BY`.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Correctly computing a cumulative total after adding a field to the Colors section" %}

As an example, let's consider a line chart showing a plot of the change in total sales by date (see [Selling](#usage-window-function) table.). The cumulative total (`IncTotal`) is calculated using the [RSUM](../function-ref/RSUM.md) window function: `RSUM(SUM([Sales]))`.

![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-8.png)

To display the change in the sales amount for each product category, add the `Category` dimension to the **Colors** section.

![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-9.png)

After that, the chart displays a separate graph for each category but the totals are calculated incorrectly: for `Furniture`, it's 49 instead of 19, for `Office Supplies`, 91 instead of 52, for `Technology`, 42 instead of 20. This is because the dimension in the **Colors** (`Category`) section is included in the grouping the same way as the dimension in the **X** section (`Date`). To calculate the amount correctly, you need to add the `Category` dimension to the `WITHIN` section or the `Date` dimension to the `AMONG` section: `RSUM(SUM([Sales]) WITHIN [Category])` or `RSUM(SUM([Sales]) AMONG [Date])`.

![image](../../_assets/datalens/concepts/tutorial/window-func-10.png)

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Correctly computing a window function for a grouping by date on a chart" %}

When adding a grouping (rounding) for a date in the chart, the original field is replaced with an automatically generated one. For example, when rounding to a month, the `[Date]` dimension is replaced with a new field using the `DATETRUNC([Date], "month")` formula. Because the original `[Date]` field disappears from the list of chart dimensions, the window function it's used in no longer works. For the function to work correctly, you need to round the original `[Date]` dimension in the formula using the [DATETRUNC](../function-ref/DATETRUNC.md) function.

{% endcut %}
