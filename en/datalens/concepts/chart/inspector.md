# Chart inspector

If a dashboard includes many charts that take a long time to load and process data, this may slow down the performance of the entire dashboard. You can analyze a chart's performance with an inspector.

A chart Inspector is a {{ datalens-short-name }} tool that helps you troubleshoot data loading and browser rendering issues. You can use it to determine why a chart is slow or optimize data fetching and chart rendering.

To open the chart inspector, click ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) in the top-right corner of the chart and select **Inspector**.

{% cut "Sample chart inspector" %}

{% endcut %}

At the top of the inspector window, there is information on the speed of basic operations:

* **Config resolving**: Chart configuration load time.
* **Data fetching**: Time it takes to load data from the source.
* **Execution**: Time to process data received from the source.
* **Rendering**: Time to render data on a chart.

Values above the optimal level are highlighted (in orange or red). To get recommendations for optimizing a metric, hover over the question mark next to its name.

For some chart types, additional metrics are displayed:


* **Columns / Rows**: Number of table columns and rows (for **Table** and **Pivot table** charts).
* **Yandex Maps API**: Time to load modules required by Yandex Maps (for **Map** charts).

The inspector also displays source Request IDs and request traces (Trace IDs).

The **Data sources** section displays information about the sources used in a chart:

* Source name.
* Link to source.
* Request body in JSON format.
* SQL query text sent to source (only if the SQL query is successful and its results are rendered in the chart).
