# Charts

_Charts_ are the visualization of data from a dataset in the form of a table, diagram, or map.

There are two types of charts in {{ datalens-short-name }} that differ by how they receive data from their sources:

* [Dataset-based charts](./dataset-based-charts.md): Charts that are created in a wizard based on data from one or more [datasets](../dataset/index.md).
* [QL charts](./ql-charts.md): Charts that are created through direct queries to the source.

{{ datalens-short-name }} supports different types of visualization: charts, tables, geographical maps, etc. For more information, see the [Visualization reference](../../visualization-ref/index.md).

For more information about charts, see the following sections:
