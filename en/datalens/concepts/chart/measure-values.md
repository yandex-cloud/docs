# Measure Names and Measure Values

When you add a measure to a chart section, two auxiliary fields are added to the dataset field list — `Measure Names` and `Measure Values`. They are absent in the original dataset field list — {{ datalens-short-name }} creates them automatically. The `Measure Names` and `Measure Values` fields are used to create charts with multiple measures.

`Measure Names` is a **dimension** (a green field) that includes **names** of all measures in the chart. It's used to group chart values or to show measure names as legends.  For example, you can use `Measure Names` to build a bar chart grouped by multiple measures or to label sectors in a pie chart.

`Measure Values` is a **measure** (blue field) that includes **values** of all measures in the chart. It's used to label values of each measure. For example, you can use `Measure Values` to label each line in a chart or each column in a bar chart.

## Using Measure Names and Measure Values in charts {#usage}

Look at practical examples of using `Measure Names` and `Measure Values` in charts. As a data source in our examples, we'll use a direct [connection](../../quickstart.md#create-connection) to a demo database (the dataset is based on the `SampleSuperstore` table).

**Example 1**

Create a pivot table with total sales across each product category by region.

Now, let's also use the table to show profit for each category and region. For this, drag the `Profit` field to **Measures**. The `Measure Names` field will be added automatically to the **Columns** section. This way, you can group your chart by measure names.

You can edit grouping by table measure names. For this, drag the `Measure Names` field to the **Rows** section.

**Example 2**

Let's use the graph to show monthly sales during a year.

Add another axis, Y, to show the profit.

Add labels with measure values to each line.  The chart uses two measures, but you can only add one of them to the **Labels** section. To label each line in this case, add `Measure Values` to **Labels**. Every line will be labeled by values of its measure.

**Example 3**

Compare the order count and average order value by region. Add the measures to the **Y** section to build a stacked bar chart. The `Measure Names` field will be added automatically to the **Colors** section for grouping by measure name.

This is not the best way to compare measures, however. Show an X-axis grouped column chart. For this, drag the `Measure Names` dimension to the **X** section.

To label each column with its measure name, add `Measure Values` to the **Labels** section.

## Limitations {#restrictions}

The following restrictions apply to the `Measure Names` and `Measure Values` fields:

* You can't use `Measure Names` and `Measure Values` to filter your chart.
* You can use `Measure Names` and `Measure Values` to sort data only in the [{#T}](../../visualization-ref/area-chart.md) and [{#T}](../../visualization-ref/normalized-area-chart.md) charts.
