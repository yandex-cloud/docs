# Wizard charts

Charts are created in a wizard based on data from one or more datasets (see [{#T}](./multidataset-chart.md)).
You can create an unlimited number of charts based on a single dataset.

The workspace in the wizard interface is divided into three main panels:

1. A dataset panel where available fields are displayed: **Dimensions** and **Measures**. You can add a [calculated field](../calculations/index.md) to the list.
1. A visualization setup panel that you can use to select a [chart type](../../visualization-ref/index.md). Each type has its own set of sections (such as X-axis, Y-axis, and filters) where you can drag and drop fields. For more information, see [{#T}](settings.md).
1. A preview panel where the visualization is displayed.

Charts let you quickly analyze and test hypotheses. You can also save charts and add them to dashboards as widgets.

{% note warning %}

{{ datalens-short-name }} limits the number of data rows displayed in charts. For more information, see [{#T}](../limits.md).

When opening a chart in a wizard:

* At the top (1), you can see general information: location, name, controls, as well as controls and saves common for all charts.
* At the bottom-left (2), you can select a [dataset](../dataset/index.md) to create a widget. After the dataset is selected, a list of fields (3) that can be used in the chart appears below it. The fields are grouped into [Dimensions (4) and Measures (5)](../dataset/data-model.md#field).
* On the right, you can see a button to select a chart type (6) and the ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/gear.svg) icon to open the general settings (7). Once the chart type is selected, you will see a list of sections (8) below. Its structure depends on the selected chart type.
* The Preview area (9) is on the right of the window.
