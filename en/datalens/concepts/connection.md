# Connections

_Connections_ contain information about data source access parameters, like the DB host IP address and connection port.

Connections are created using a connector. Connectors contain settings for connecting to popular data sources.
You can create [_datasets_](dataset/index.md) based on connections.

- **ClickHouse**
- **PostgreSQL**
