# Caching

_Cache_ stores frequently requested data and provides quick access to it.

{{ datalens-short-name }} caches the results of the user's query, so when the data in the source changes, dashboards and charts may not be updated immediately.

The default cache lifetime depends on how the dataset accesses the data source:

* Direct access datasets: 5 minutes.
* Materialized datasets: 60 minutes with auto-renewal.
Example of auto-renewal: after the first user request, the data was written to the cache for 60 minutes. After 50 minutes, with a new request, the data is retrieved from the cache, and the cache lifetime becomes 60 minutes.

The user can change the cache lifetime in the [connection](../operations/connection/create-clickhouse.md) settings.

## Caching in {{ datalens-public }} {#caching-in-public}

The default cache lifetime depends on how the dataset accesses the data source:

* Direct access datasets: 5 minutes.
* Materialized datasets: 6 hours with auto-renewal.
Example of auto-renewal: After the first user request, the data was written to the cache for 6 hours. After 5 hours 50 minutes, a new request is sent, the data is retrieved from the cache, and the cache lifetime becomes 6 hours.

The user can change the cache lifetime in the connection settings.

## Purge cache conditions {#reset-cache}

The cache is purged in the following events:

* Re-materialization.
* Connection replacement.
* SQL query update when generating a dataset.
