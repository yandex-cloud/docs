# Charts

_Charts_ are the visualization of data from a dataset in the form of a table, diagram, or map.

Charts are created in a wizard based on data from one or multiple datasets (see [multi-dataset charts](#multi-dataset-charts)).
You can create an unlimited number of charts based on a single dataset.

The workspace in the wizard interface is divided into three main panels:

1. A dataset panel where available fields are displayed: **Dimensions** and **Measures**. You can add a [calculated field](calculations.md) to the list.
1. A visualization setup panel where you can select the chart type. Each type has its own set of sections (such as X-axis, Y-axis, and filters) where you can drag and drop fields.
1. A preview panel where the visualization is displayed.

Charts let you quickly analyze and test hypotheses. You can also save charts and add them to dashboards as widgets.

{% note warning %}

{{ datalens-short-name }} limits the number of data rows displayed in charts. Read about them in the section [{#T}](limits.md).

### Map {#map-chart}

Map supports three types of visualization:

* [Point map](#point-map-chart)
* [Choropleth map](#choropleth-map-chart)
* [Heat map](#heat-map-chart)

You can place no more than 5 layers with any visualization type on a map. Layers in the **Map** chart are called geolayers.

_Geolayers_ visualize indicators using points or polygons on the map.

You can do the following operations with geolayers:

* Change name.
* Set transparency level.
* Reorder the layers inside a same visualization type. However, you can't change the order of visualization types (top-to-bottom: point map, chloropleth map, heat map).

You can purchase pre-calculated geolayers from partners in {{ marketplace-name }}.

## Multi-dataset charts {#multi-dataset-charts}

Multi-dataset charts display data from multiple datasets.

Queries for each dataset are processed independently of each other. Calculated fields can't be applied to fields from multiple datasets.
When you add a second dataset, the link is automatically created based on the first match for the field name and field data type.

In this case, you can:

* Change links.
* Add new links.
* Delete links.

{% note info %}

  Datasets used in the chart may be non-linked.

{% endnote %}

Specifics of working with linked datasets in the chart, except for geochart layers:

* One chart can use any measures from datasets, regardless of their links.
* One chart can only use linked dimensions.
* Filters by linked dimensions are applied to all datasets.
* Filters by non-linked dimensions are applied only to their own dataset.

Working with linked datasets in geovisualizations on different layers:

* A geolayer can use any measures from datasets regardless of their links
* A geolayer can only use its linked dimensions.
* Filters by linked dimensions from the **General filters** section are applied to all datasets in all layers.
* Filters from the **General filters** section that use non-linked dimensions only apply to their own dataset in all layers.
* Filters in the **Layer filters** section that use linked dimensions apply to all datasets within the current layer.
* Filters in the **Layer filters** section that use non-linked dimensions only apply to their own dataset within the current layer.
* There are no restrictions on using non-linked dimensions in different layers.

## Publishing a chart {#public-access}

You can grant any internet user access to a chart using [{{ datalens-public }}](datalens-public.md). This chart becomes public and any user can view it without authorization.

{% include [share-note](../../_includes/datalens/datalens-share-note.md) %}

## Access management {#access-management}

You can configure chart permissions. For more information, see [{#T}](../security/index.md).
