# Dashboards

_Dashboards_ are pages or sets of pages that contain widgets. They let you group charts in one place and add explanatory text and titles.
You can create new dashboard pages using the **tab** element.

## Display modes {#display-modes}

{{ datalens-short-name }} allows you to display the dashboard in full-screen mode. This mode hides part of the interface elements and expands the widget area on the screen.

On the mobile version of the dashboard, {{ datalens-short-name }} displays the charts one after another using the following sorting rule: left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

## Widgets {#widget}

_Widgets_ are dashboard elements. You can create links between selector and chart widgets.

{{ datalens-full-name }} offers the following types of widgets:

- [Chart](#chart)
- [Selector](#selector)
- [Text](#text)
- [Title](#title)

### Charts {#chart}

Visualization as a table or chart.
You can place charts anywhere on a dashboard and change their size.
Charts can be linked to selectors.

For more information about charts, see [{#T}](chart.md).

### Selector {#selector}

A filter that affects query results on its linked widgets. The selector can be linked to a chart or another selector.
Works within a single dashboard tab.

For more information, see [{#T}](#link).

### Text {#text}

A widget represented as text. It lets you place things like a set of links or explanatory captions on a dashboard. The [Markdown markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is supported.
For more information about Markdown markup, see [{#T}](markdown.md).

### Title {#title}

A widget represented as a heading. It lets you differentiate charts by meaning and divide them into groups within a single dashboard page.

## Link {#link}

Links determine how a selector affects one or more charts, or other selectors. By default, selectors are linked with charts created within a single dataset. Selectors and charts based on different datasets can also be linked manually.

You can choose an existing dataset field as the link or create your own field where you manually set the selector values.

You can use links to filter the values of selectors and charts. For example, if you select a country in the first selector on the dashboard, the second selector limits the list of cities (and vice versa).

The link type determines how values in selectors and charts are filtered. The type is set in the links window in dashboard edit mode.
You can use the following types of links for a pair of widgets:

* **Link**, for widgets that mutually affect each other.
* **Incoming link**, when a widget is affected by a widget.
* **Outgoing link**, when a widget affects another widget.
* **Ignore**, for widgets that mutually ignore each other.
* **No link**, for widgets from different datasets or widgets that can't be linked.

{% note warning %}

You can't create a link with [{#T}](#text) and [{#T}](#title) widgets.

{% endnote %}

Some widgets can't affect other widgets. Possible types of links between widgets are shown in the table:

| Affects/Affected | Selector | Charts |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Selector** | Link<br/>Incoming link<br/>Outgoing link<br/>Ignore | Outgoing link<br/>Ignore |
| **Charts** | Incoming link<br/>Ignore | â€” |

## Publishing dashboards {#public-access}

You can grant any internet user access to a dashboard using [{{ datalens-public }}](datalens-public.md). This dashboard becomes public and any user can view it without authorization.

{% include [share-note](../../_includes/datalens/datalens-share-note.md) %}

## Access management {#access-management}

You can configure dashboard permissions. For more information, see [{#T}](../security/index.md).
