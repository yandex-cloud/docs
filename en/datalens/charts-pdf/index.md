### About {#about-service}

Service address: [pdf.charts.yandex-team.ru](https://pdf.charts.yandex-team.ru).

This service enables us to easily generate, from simple JSON templates, PDF presentations that include our charts, tables, and other items. Basically, the service provides editing of templates and rendering of pages with components based on the templates, and the PDF file is generated by [Snapter](https://github.yandex-team.ru/data-ui/snapter).

Currently, the service is new and is at beta stage. To report bugs and suggestions, contact [apanchuk@](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/apanchuk) or message at [stat@](mailto:stat@yandex-team.ru) or the [DataLens Community [NDA] Telegram chat](https://nda.ya.ru/t/TVOKkRgL5pcKF3).
