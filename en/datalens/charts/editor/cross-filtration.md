# Cross-filtering


{% include [business-note](../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-functionality-available-business-note.md) %}


Filtering parameters are used to filter charts by charts. In this case, some chart acts as a selector for other charts.

When a filtering chart is opened from a dashboard for edits or in a new tab, the filter parameters are highlighted.

By default, when opening a filtering chart from the navigation panel, no filters apply. For debugging, you can add the reserved `_action_params=1` parameter to the page `url`.
