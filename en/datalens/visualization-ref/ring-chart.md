# Donut chart ![](../../_assets/datalens/ring.svg)

This chart shows the proportion of different categories using donut segments. The sum of all segments is 100%. The size of each segment corresponds to the percentage of a category in the total amount. A number in the center of a ring depends on the selected measure and indicates the overall total. Donut charts are a good choice if you need to display a small number of segments.

## Creating a donut chart {#create-diagram}

To create a donut chart:

1. On the {{ datalens-full-name }} [home page]({{ link-datalens-main }}), click **Create chart**.
1. Under **Dataset**, select a dataset for visualization.
1. Select **Donut chart** as the chart type.
1. Drag a dimension or measure from the dataset to the **Color** section.
1. Drag a measure from the dataset to the **Measures** section. The values are displayed as donut chart segments.

To disable displaying a number in the center:

1. In the upper-left part of the screen, click ![image](../../_assets/datalens/gear.svg).
1. In the **Chart settings** window, disable the **Totals** option.
1. Click **Apply**.

## Recommendations {#recommendations}

* If there are more than 4-6 segments per chart, group the smallest of them as **Other**. A larger number of segments overloads a chart and makes it difficult to understand the data.
* You can't display negative and null values on this type of chart.
* Don't use donut charts to show changes to proportions over time or for precisely comparing data by category.
