# Indicator ![](../../_assets/datalens/indicator.svg)

An indicator reflects the value of a single key measure. It's used when a dashboard contains values that need to be monitored on a regular basis to understand the overall situation. These can be the number of incidents for the past day, plan performance, or a YoY increase in sales. Indicators are most often placed at the top or on the right side of a dashboard. Be sure there are no more than 6 indicators per screen so that they don't lose their urgency or confuse users. Using indicators of different sizes, you can build a hierarchy of the various metrics according to significance.

## Recommendations {#recommendations}

* Use emojis when calculating indicator values to make them more informative.

  ![indicator-chart-emoji](../../_assets/datalens/visualization-ref/indicator-chart/indicator-chart-emoji.png)

  This indicator chart uses a calculated field with the formula `IF([Average spend]>2200, CONCAT("‚úîÔ∏è",STR(ROUND([Average spend]))),CONCAT("üîª",STR(round([Average spend]))))`.

* Describe the context to make it clear what indicators mean.
