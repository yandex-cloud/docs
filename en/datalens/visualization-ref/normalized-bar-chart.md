# Normalized bar chart ![](../../_assets/datalens/normalized-horizontal-bar.svg)

A normalized bar chart shows the contribution, as a percentage, of multiple measures in the total amount by period or category. Unlike a [stacked bar chart](bar-chart.md##stacked), the proportion of segment ratios and not the total bar length is important for this type of chart. Segments are highlighted in different colors and located one after the other. The length of a segment indicates its ratio to the total amount represented as 100%. For example, the percentage of expenses in the annual budget.

A normalized bar chart shows the contribution, as a percentage, of each category in the total measure value over a time interval. For example, the percentage of sales for different product categories.

## Sections in the wizard {#wizard-sections}

| Section<br/> in the wizard | Description |
----- | ----
| Y | Dimensions. One or two dimensions can be specified. For the `Date` and `Date and time` types, you can set grouping by time: minutes, hours, weeks, and so on. |
| X | Measure. You can specify multiple measures. If you add more than one measure to a section, the **Colors** section contains a dimension named [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md). You may move [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) to the Y-axis. |
| Colors | Dimension or the [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) field. Affects the color of lines. [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) is removed by deleting measures from the Y-axis. |
| Sorting | Dimension or measure. Affects the sorting of columns. |
| Signatures | Measure. Displays measure values on the chart. If multiple measures are added to the **Y** section, drag [Measure Values](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) to this section. |
| Chart filters | Dimension or measure. Used as a filter. |

## Creating a normalized bar chart {#create-diagram}

To create a normalized bar chart:

1. On the {{ datalens-full-name }} [home page]({{ link-datalens-main }}), click **Create chart**.
1. Under **Dataset**, select a dataset for visualization.
1. Select **Normalized bar chart** as the chart type.
1. Drag one or more dimensions from the dataset to the **Y** section. The values are displayed on the Y-axis.
1. Drag one or more measures from the dataset to the **X** section.
1. Drag a dimension from the dataset or the [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) field to the **Colors** section.

## Recommendations {#recomendations}

* {% include [category-text](../../_includes/datalens/datalens-category-text.md) %}
* Don't display more than 3-5 segments on the chart.
* When visualizing multiple measures, select colors carefully. They should be distinguishable and contrasting. We recommend using no more than 3-5 colors per chart. If you want to emphasize one certain measure above the others, highlight it in some bright color.
