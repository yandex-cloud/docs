# Pricing for {{ datalens-full-name }}

In {{ datalens-short-name }}, you pay for:

* The number of ten-minute sessions to the data source. The session considers requests from charts and dashboards.
* The size of the database for materialized data.
* Additional {{ datalens-short-name }} features.

The number of sessions, the database size for materialized data, and the list of available features are determined by the monthly billing plan.
You can choose one of the following plans: **Free** or **Standard**.

The plan applies to [the folder](../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) where the {{ datalens-short-name }} instance is located.

## Session {#sessions}

Sessions are ten-minute periods when the user makes requests to a data source. For example, a user updates charts and dashboards and builds custom requests in the wizard.

![image](../_assets/datalens/concepts/datalens-sessions.svg)

The session starts with a data request and ends when there are no new requests for at least ten minutes.
The time difference between the first and last request is rounded up to ten minutes.

The session is calculated based on the user activity in the folder. If multiple users are working in the same {{ datalens-short-name }} instance at the same time, the service counts multiple sessions.
If one user is working in multiple {{ datalens-short-name }} instances at the same time, the service calculates sessions in these instances independently of one another.

### Session types {#session-types}

In {{ datalens-short-name }}, sessions are categorized as internal or external:

| Session type | Data source |
| ----- | ----- |
| Internal | Materialized datasets<br/>CSV connection<br/>Metrica<br/>Metrica Logs API<br/>AppMetrica<br/>AppMetrica Logs API<br/>Managed databases in Yandex.Cloud:<br/> - [Managed Service for ClickHouse](../managed-clickhouse)<br/> - [Managed Service for PostgreSQL](../managed-postgresql)<br/> - [Managed Service for MySQL<sup>®</sup>](../managed-mysql) |
| External | Any data source that is not related to Yandex or Yandex.Cloud. |

### How sessions are calculated {#how-sessions-counted}

Each plan determines the number of internal sessions available. If a session has at least one request to an external data source, the whole session is considered external.

External sessions are calculated using the **x 10** multiplier. This means that each external session is counted as ten internal sessions.

> For instance, a dashboard contains some charts that request a materialized dataset and a single chart that requests an external data source.

When this kind of dashboard updates, the session is considered external.

The session doesn't consider requests from:

* The preview window in datasets.
* Public dashboards and charts.

## Materialized data {#materialized-data}

A materialized data quota is available for each {{ datalens-short-name }} instance.

The quota includes:

* Dataset preview data.

* Materialized dataset data.

* Materialized connection data.

* Geocoding result caching data.

  {% note info %}

  The geocoding result cache is stored for 30 days.

## Enabling a billing plan {#enable-the-plan}

To activate a billing plan, go to your billing account and select the desired plan. The period starts on the date when the {{ datalens-short-name }} instance is created.
You're charged for the plan on the first day of the period.

If you created a billing account in the cloud, then the {{ datalens-short-name }} instance automatically switches to the **Free** plan.
Until you create a billing account, the {{ datalens-short-name }} instance remains in demo mode.

> If you created a {{ datalens-short-name }} instance on January 31, the next charge would occur on February 28 (or February 29 if it's a leap year).

### Switching plans {#change-the-plan}

You can switch from the **Free** to the **Standard** plan at any time. When you switch plans, the period starts the day the plan is switched.

So if you go from the **Standard** plan to the **Free** plan, the new plan and period would come into effect when the paid period under the **Standard** plan ends. In this case, the start date of the new period becomes the date the **Standard** plan ends.

### Automatic session renewal {#autoprolongation}

Under the **Standard** plan, you can set up automatic session renewal. To do this, you should specify your planned budget in the billing account.

Automatic session renewal isn't available in the **Free** plan. If you reach the session limit or the DB size limit for this plan, you can switch to the **Standard** plan.

### Blocks {#blockings}

If you reach a limit under your plan, {{ datalens-short-name }} automatically blocks the instance.

When an instance is blocked, you can't:

* Create new connections or datasets.
* Request data from a dataset.
* Request data from the wizard or dashboard.
* Materialize dataset data.
* Use geocoding.

However, you can view object settings and create new charts and dashboards.

If Yandex.Cloud can't withdraw the amount to pay for your plan, it blocks access to your {{ datalens-short-name }} instance.
