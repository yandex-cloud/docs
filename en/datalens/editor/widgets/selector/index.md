# Selector

## General information {#note-selector}

The selector describes a set of controls to set parameters for dashboard charts. The chart parses the parameter and applies relevant filtering to the field with which the parameter is linked (see the [example](https://datalens.yandex-team.ru/editor/ripzkh2fm9ygk-dashboard-operators-demo-selector)).
