# Neuroanalyst on your dashboard in {{ datalens-full-name }}

[Neuroanalyst](../concepts/neuroanalyst.md) on your dashboard is a tool that analyzes dashboard charts, generates findings based on their data, and allows you to ask follow-up questions. It also considers the following for context:
* [Dashboard information](../operations/dashboard/add-description.md).
* Dashboard chart header.
* [Chart information](../operations/chart/add-description.md).
* Dashboard chart [description and tooltip](../operations/dashboard/add-chart.md) (other than tables).

You can use Neuroanalyst for the entire dashboard or individual charts on the dashboard. To use Neuroanalyst on your dashboard:
