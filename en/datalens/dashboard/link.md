# Link

Links determine how a selector affects one or more charts or other selectors. By default, selectors are linked with charts created within a single dataset. Selectors and charts based on different datasets can also be linked manually using [aliases](#alias).

You can choose an existing dataset field as the link or create your own field where you manually set the selector values. You can specify the fields to be associated through a link in the alias configuration window.

You can use links to filter the values of selectors and charts. For example, if you select a country in the first selector on the dashboard, the second selector limits the list of cities (and vice versa).

The field used by the selector to filter on must be included in the dataset used to construct a chart. Otherwise, the link will not work. For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/data-join.md).

The link type determines how values in selectors and charts are filtered. The type is set in the links window in the dashboard edit mode.
You can use the following types of links for a widget pair:

* **Link**: For widgets that mutually affect each other.
* **Incoming link**: When a widget is affected by another widget.
* **Outgoing link**: When a widget affects another widget.
* **Ignore**: For widgets that mutually ignore each other.
* **No link**: For widgets from different datasets or widgets that cannot be linked.

{% note warning %}

You cannot create a link with [{#T}](./widget.md#text) and [{#T}](./widget.md#title) widgets.

{% endnote %}

Some widgets cannot affect other widgets. The table below shows possible types of links between widgets:

| Affects/Affected | Selector | Charts |
----- | ----- | -----
| **Selector** | Link<br/>Incoming link<br/>Outgoing link<br/>Ignore | Outgoing link<br/>Ignore |
| **Chart** | Incoming link<br/>Ignore | â€” |

## Alias {#alias}

An alias is a link between fields of different datasets, which determines how widgets impact each other when you link them.

Aliases allow you to link widgets that are based on different datasets. For example, if you create an alias using the `[Region]` and `[Country]` fields from different datasets, a selector by the `[Region]` field from one dataset will filter data in a chart with the `[Country]` field of another dataset. For widgets based on the same dataset, aliases are created automatically. Creating aliases is required when you need to:

* Establish links between selectors that are based on different datasets, so that the values of one selector filter the list of available values of another selector.

* Establish links between a selector of the **Based on dataset** type from one dataset and charts from another dataset, so that the selector values filter the values in the charts.

* Establish links between a selector of the **Manual input** type and other selectors, so that the values of one selector filter the list of available values of another selector.

You can specify an alias for a pair of linked widgets. In this case:

* Multiple aliases can be set for a single pair of widgets.
* An alias set for one pair of widgets is applied to all linked widgets that are based on the same datasets (which use the fields specified in the alias).
* An alias works within a single dashboard tab.
* To limit the use of aliases, set **Ignore** as your link type for the link between your widgets on the selected field. In this case, the widgets for the selected field will have no effect on the dashboard tab.

For more information about how to create aliases, see [{#T}](../operations/dashboard/create-alias.md).

You can delete links from an alias where more than two fields are linked. Delete a field from the alias if its associated link between datasets or widgets is not required on a dashboard tab. For more information, see [{#T}](../operations/dashboard/edit-alias.md).
