# Versioning in {{ datalens-full-name }}

Dataset versioning means storing the history of dataset configuration changes through versions. A list of versions is available to users with the minimum edit permission for the dataset.

To go to the list of versions, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) at the top of the screen and select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/clock.svg) **Change history**.

To select a version from the list, click it. The version number will be displayed in the `revId` parameter in the dataset address string. Click a link with the version number in the `revId` parameter to open the relevant version of the dataset.

## Version types {#version-types}

All versions fall into the following types:

1. **Current**: This is the most recently saved version of a dataset. It is displayed for all users that open the dataset for viewing in the workbook or from the navigation panel. A dataset can only have one current version.
1. **Outdated**: This version is no longer current.  
   When you open an outdated version, a panel appears at the top indicating the version type, creation date and time, and login of the version author. There are buttons in the right-hand panel:

   * **Make current**: Turns an outdated version into the current one. The version current at the time will become outdated.
   * **Open current**: Opens the current version.
   
   {% cut "Outdated version" %}

   {% endcut %}

## Creating a new version {#version-create}

A new version is automatically created when you click **Save** in dataset edit mode. Below are dataset configuration changes that create a new version once they are saved:

* Changes on the **Sources** tab:

  * Replacing a [connection](../concepts/connection.md).
  * [Adding data](../dataset/create-dataset.md#add-data) to the workspace from source tables or via an SQL query.
  * [Configuring links](../dataset/create-dataset.md#links).
  * Changing data table settings. To open the settings window, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) â†’ **Change settings** to the right of the table.

* Adding, editing, deleting [fields](../dataset/create-dataset.md#field-operations) on the **Fields** tab.
* Adding, editing, deleting a [parameter](../dataset/create-dataset.md#add-parameters) on the **Parameters** tab.
* Adding, editing, deleting a [filter](../dataset/create-dataset.md#add-filters) on the **Filtering** tab.

## Editing versions {#version-edit}

You can edit any version of a dataset.

### Editing an outdated version {#current-version-edit}

To edit an outdated version, select it from the list of versions. To save your changes to an outdated version, click **Save** at the top right. This will create a new current version, and all others will become outdated.

## Limitations {#restrictions}

* You can only switch to versions created on or after December 1, 2024. Currently, if you edit a dataset created before this date, saving your changes will delete the previous version.
* Change history is only available for the last three months.
* The change history only contains a list of dataset versions and indicates the version type, save date and time, and user who made the change.
* Dataset versions do not include:

  * Access permission changes (this operation is performed separately from dataset edits).
  * Changes to connection settings made using the interface for editing connection parameters.
  * Data changes to the source (rows added, updated, or deleted in the data source).

* Versions do not display a list of changes. You can only view the saved status of the dataset configuration.
