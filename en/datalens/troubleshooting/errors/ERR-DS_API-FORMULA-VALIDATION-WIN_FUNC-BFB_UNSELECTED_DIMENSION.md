# Window function has unselected dimension

`ERR.DS_API.FORMULA.VALIDATION.WIN_FUNC.BFB_UNSELECTED_DIMENSION`

The error occurs when a dimension not involved in the chart building (is not in any of its sections) is specified in the window function formula after `BEFORE FILTER BY`.
To fix the error, drag the indicated dimension into one of the chart sections or use a different dimension.
