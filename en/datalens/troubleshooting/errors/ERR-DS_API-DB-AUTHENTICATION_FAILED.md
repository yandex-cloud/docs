# Database authentication failed

`ERR.DS_API.DB.AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`

Connection to source with specified login and password failed.

To fix this error:

* Verify that the credentials (login and password) that you entered are correct â€” you might have entered them in Russian or with the `Caps Lock` on, or you might have entered an extra character or copied the information with an extra space.
* Use any DB client to verify that you can connect to the source with the login and password entered.
