# [{{ datalens-full-name }}] Database authentication failed

`ERR.DS_API.DB.AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`

Connection to source with specified credentials failed.

To fix this error:

* Make sure your credentials (username and password) are correct; you might have used a wrong keyboard layout, had `Caps Lock` on, typed in an extra character, or pasted the credentials with an extra space. If this is not the case, check the username and password with the database administrator.
* Use any database client to verify that you can connect to the source with the username and password you entered.
