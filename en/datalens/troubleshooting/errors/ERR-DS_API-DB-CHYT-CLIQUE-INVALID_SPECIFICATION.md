# Invalid clique specification. Probably, clique does not exists

`ERR.DS_API.DB.CHYT.CLIQUE.INVALID_SPECIFICATION`

The clique specified in the connection settings does not exist. Possible cause:

* The clique name has been incorrectly specified in the connection. Make sure that you have correctly specified the name of the clique in the connection settings.
* The clique has been deleted. Replace the clique in the connection settings with another clique (we recommend [creating](https://yt.yandex-team.ru/docs/description/chyt/cliques/start) a private clique).
