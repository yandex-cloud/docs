## Permissions {#permissions}

### How do I add a user and send them a link to the dashboard? {#how-add-user-send-ref}

To allow another user with a Yandex account to open your dashboard, configure access to {{ datalens-full-name }}:

{% cut "1. Add a user to the cloud." %}

   1. Open the page [Access control]({{ link-console-access-management }}).
   1. In the upper-right corner, click **Add user**.
   1. Enter the user's Yandex email address and click **Add**. The new user appears in the list of users.
   1. Click ![image](../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) next to the new user and select **Configure roles**.
   1. Under **Roles in folders**, select a folder. In the **Roles** column, click ![image](../../_assets/plus-sign.svg). Assign the `datalens.instances.user` role.

      After that, the user has access to your {{ datalens-full-name }} instance.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "2. Make sure the user has permission to access the dashboard." %}

   1. Open the dashboard.
   1. Click ![image](../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) â†’ **Permissions**.
   1. In the **Add member** field, enter "All" or the name of the user who needs extended permissions.
   1. Go to the **Current object** section and set the permissions for the dashboard:

      * View: Read only is available.
      * Edit: View and edit options are available.
      * Administration: View, edit, and manage options are available.
      
   1. Enable the **Linked objects** option to grant permission to other dashboard-related objects (connections, dashboards, and charts).

   The user is granted access to your {{ datalens-short-name }} and objects with **All** permissions. You can assign this user individual permissions to objects.

{% endcut %}

You can send the link to the dashboard from the browser. To learn more about permissions for {{ datalens-short-name }} objects, see the [documentation](https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/docs/datalens/security/#permissions).

You can also make your dashboard public using [{#T}](../concepts/datalens-public.md).

### Can I install {{ datalens-short-name }} locally inside the company? {#datalens-local}

{{ datalens-short-name }} is offered only as a cloud service. We would also like to note:

- {{ datalens-short-name }} is a {{ yandex-cloud }} service, which is compliant with Federal Law No. 152 and industry security standards. For more information, see [{{ yandex-cloud }} security](https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/security).

### Why is the cloud with a {{ datalens-short-name }} instance blocked? {#datalens-suspended}

Your cloud may be blocked in the following cases:

- Outstanding charges for {{ yandex-cloud }} paid services that are in the same cloud as {{ datalens-short-name }}.
- Expiration of a trial period for {{ yandex-cloud }} paid services.
- Violation of the {{ yandex-cloud }} [Terms of Use](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_termsofuse/?lang=en).
