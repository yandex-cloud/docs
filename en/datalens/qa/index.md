## Permissions {#permissions}

### How do I add a user and send them a link to the dashboard? {#how-add-user-send-ref}

To allow another user with a Yandex account to open your dashboard, configure access to {{ datalens-full-name }}:

1. Add a user:

   {% list tabs %}

   - To an organization

     {% include [datalens-add-user-organization](../../_includes/datalens/operations/datalens-add-user-organization.md) %}

     After that, the user has access to your {{ datalens-full-name }} instance.

   - To a cloud

     1. Go to [Access control]({{ link-console-access-management }}).
     1. In the top right-hand corner, click **Add user**.
     1. Enter the user's Yandex email address and click **Add**. The new user appears in the list of users.
     1. Click ![image](../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) next to the new user and select **Configure roles**.
     1. Under **Roles in folders**, select a folder. In the **Roles** column, click ![image](../../_assets/plus-sign.svg). Assign the `datalens.instances.user` role.

     After that, the user has access to your {{ datalens-full-name }} instance.

   {% endlist %}

1. Make sure that the user has access to the dashboard:

   1. Open the dashboard.
   1. In the **Add member** field, enter "All" or the name of the user who needs extended permissions.
   1. Go to the **Current object** section and set the permissions for the dashboard:

      * View: Read only is available.
      * Edit: View and edit options are available.
      * Administration: View, edit, and manage options are available.

   1. Enable the **Linked objects** option to grant permissions to other dashboard-related objects (connections, dashboards, and charts).

The user is granted access to your {{ datalens-short-name }} and objects with **All** permissions. You can assign this user individual permissions to objects.

You can send the link to the dashboard from the browser. For more information about permissions for {{ datalens-short-name }} objects, see the [documentation](../security/index.md#permissions).

You can also make your dashboard public using [{#T}](../concepts/datalens-public.md).

### How do I make a dashboard containing Yandex Metrica or AppMetrica data public? {#how-metrica-appmetrica-share}

Datasets based on a connection to the Yandex Metrica API and AppMetrica do not support materialization and you cannot publish such a dashboard.

To share a dashboard containing Yandex Metrica or AppMetrica data, use one of the following methods:

{% include [datalens-metrica-appmetrica-share](../../_includes/datalens/datalens-metrica-appmetrica-share.md) %}
