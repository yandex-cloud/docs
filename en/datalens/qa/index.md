#### Why is a cloud with the {{ datalens-short-name }} instance suspended? {#datalens-suspended}

Your cloud may be suspended in the following cases:

- Arrears on your account, if you use the paid {{ yandex-cloud }} services. 
- Your trial period of the paid {{ yandex-cloud }} services is over.
- You are in violation of the [{{ yandex-cloud }} Terms of Use](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_termsofuse/).

When a cloud is suspended, your DataLens instance will be unavailable. You won't be able to use DataLens until access to the cloud is restored.
