# Pricing plan

Service plans let the Marketplace partner define the cost of using their Marketplace product.

There are two types of pricing policies:

* Core/s â€” Cores/s: Product usage is charged based on the plan's per-second fee multiplied by the number of VM cores with the `RUNNING` status.
* VM/s: Product usage is charged per second of running the product on the VMs with the `RUNNING` status.

{{ yandex-cloud }} charges a commission of 20% of the cost to use an image.
