# Unlinking a subscription

If you unlink a subscription, the product will stop working until you link another active subscription to the resource, app, or service. The subscription remains active until the end of the paid period, regardless of whether it is linked.

If a product for {{ compute-name }} is available both under a subscription and `Pay as you go`, as soon as you unlink the subscription from your virtual machine, the product installed on it will start to be charged based on `Pay as you go` rates. You can see the available pricing types in the product card.

To unlink a subscription:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

    1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder the [subscription](../../concepts/users/subscription.md) is in.
    1. At the top of the screen, click the panel with ready-made solutions for {{ marketplace-name }}.
    1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/file-ruble.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.marketplace-v2.label_licenses }}**.
    1. In the line with the subscription, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) → **{{ ui-key.yacloud.marketplace-v2.action_detach-subscription }}**.
    1. In the window that opens, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.continue }}**.
