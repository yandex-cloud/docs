# Create a new product

To add a product to Marketplace, you need to [create an image in {{ compute-name }}](../../compute/operations/image-create/upload.md). Then follow these steps:

## Tell users about your product {#description}

{% include [new-product-desc](../_includes_service/new-product-desc.md) %}

## Upload the first version of the product {#first-version}

{% include [new-product-version](../_includes_service/new-product-version.md) %}
