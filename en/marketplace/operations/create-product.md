# Creating a product

To add a product to the Marketplace, upload an image based on [Linux](create-image.md#create) or [Windows Server](create-image-ms.md) in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

## Providing product details {#tell-about}

{% include [product](../../_includes/marketplace/product.md) %}

## Creating the first version of the product {#first-version}

{% include [product-version](../../_includes/marketplace/product-version.md) %}

The product's first version will be sent for moderation to {{ yandex-cloud }}. After it passes moderation, you'll get an email confirming that your product is available to users in the Marketplace public catalog.
