# Creating a product image to upload to the Marketplace

To add a product to the Marketplace, you need to upload an image to {{ yandex-cloud }}.

## Creating an image {#create}

{% include [create-image](../../_includes/marketplace/image.md) %}

## Image requirements {#requirements}

Products placed on the Marketplace can be created based on Linux and Windows.

### Linux-based products {#linux-requirements}

Make sure to meet the following requirements for Linux-based product images:

* The network interface runs correctly when starting a VM and obtains the IP address via DHCP.
* The image has the `cloud-init` package installed and configured to work with our [metadata service](../../compute/operations/vm-info/get-info.md#inside-instance), as well as the `virtio-net` and `virtio-blk` drivers.
* In the system firewall settings, the minimum required set of ports for running your applications and a port for SSH access (by default, this is port 22 TCP) are open.
* The SSH server starts automatically at VM startup.
* Services running your application are resistant to VM reboots.
* The Linux kernel is running with the `console=ttyS0` parameter.
* GPT disk partitioning is used.
* The disk is mounted by its UUID rather than by name.

### Before uploading the image {#before-uploading}

Clean up:

* The `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, and `/var/log` directories.
* The package manager cache.
* `.bash_history` for all users.
* The data on configurations previously received via DHCP (`dhcp.leases` and `dhcp.log`).
* The `/etc/machine-id` file.

Make sure that:

* The image only has the system users that the applications need.
* There are no pre-generated SSH keys or passwords in the image. If necessary, application passwords are generated at VM startup. The user can change them the first time they log in via the serial console or SSH. Password-based access via SSH must be disabled for all users. They may log in only using a key obtained from the [metadata service](../../compute/operations/vm-info/get-info.md#inside-instance).
* The `/etc/sudoers*` file has no extra privileges configured for users.

## Checking your image {#check-image}

You can use the [yc-image-cleanup.sh](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/examples/blob/master/products-prepare/linux/yc-image-cleanup.sh) script to:

* Clean up a VM before creating an image from it:

    ```
    ./yc-image-cleanup.sh -c
    ```

    {% note warning %}

    The cleanup command deletes some files and directories. Before running it, make sure that you have backups of important data.

    {% endnote %}

* Check the image for compliance with some [requirements](#requirements):

    ```
    ./yc-image-cleanup.sh -d
    ```

* Test the VM that you [created](../../compute/operations/image-create/upload.md#create-vm-from-user-image) from the image:

    ```
    ./yc-image-cleanup.sh -t
    ```

You should run the `yc-image-cleanup.sh` script inside the VM instance as a `root` user.

The `yc-image-cleanup.sh` script does not check the product image for compliance with all requirements and is not compatible with all distributions. Before uploading the image to the Marketplace, you'll need to perform additional checks yourself.
