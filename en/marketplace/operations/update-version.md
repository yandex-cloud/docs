# Changing product versions

Before publication, the version must be moderated by technical experts and editors. You can edit a version until it's submitted for moderation. After it passes moderation, you can also make changes.  In this case, you'll have to repeat moderation. When moderation succeeds, the publisher can publish the approved version.

To change the version:

1. Log in to the [{{ marketplace-short-name }} partner interface]({{ link-cloud-partners }}).

1. Open the **Products** section and select a product.

1. On the **Product versions** tab, select the version.

1. In the upper-right corner, click **Edit**.

1. Make changes and click **Edit**.

While a version is under moderation, you can [add a new version](create-new-version.md) to the product.
