# Getting started with the Marketplace partner interface

You can use the Marketplace partner interface to add images of your products to the Marketplace and manage their versions and service plans. Register in the Marketplace partner interface and upload your first image following the instructions.

## Registration {#registration}

{% include [registration](../_includes/marketplace/registration.md) %}

## Creating a service plan {#create-tariff}

{% include [tariff-note](../_includes/marketplace/tariff-note.md) %}

The service plan determines the cost of running your products. Create a new service plan to assign it to the product.

{% include [tariff](../_includes/marketplace/tariff.md) %}

## Creating and uploading a product image {#create-image}

{% include [image](../_includes/marketplace/image.md) %}

## Creating a product {#create-product}

{% include [product](../_includes/marketplace/product.md) %}

## Creating the first version of the product {#create-version}

{% include [product-version](../_includes/marketplace/product-version.md) %}

The product's first version will be sent for moderation to {{ yandex-cloud }}. After it passes moderation, you'll get an email confirming that your product is available to users in the Marketplace public catalog.
