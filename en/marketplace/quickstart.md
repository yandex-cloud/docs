# Getting started with the {{ marketplace-name }} partner interface

You can use the Marketplace partner interface to add images of your products to the Marketplace and manage their versions and service plans. Register in the Marketplace partner interface and upload your first image following the instructions.

## Registration {#registration}

{% include [registration](../_includes/marketplace/registration.md) %}

## Creating a service plan {#create-tariff}

{% include [tariff-note](../_includes/marketplace/tariff-note.md) %}

The service plan determines the cost of running your products. Create a new service plan to assign it to the product.

{% include [tariff](../_includes/marketplace/tariff.md) %}

## Creating and uploading a product image {#create-image}

Product images to be uploaded to the Marketplace can be based on Linux or Windows Server. Requirements for images and recommendations for creating images are described in the instructions:

* [{#T}](operations/create-image.md)
* [{#T}](operations/create-image-ms.md)

## Creating a product {#create-product}

{% include [product](../_includes/marketplace/product.md) %}

## Creating the first version of the product {#create-version}

{% include [product-version](../_includes/marketplace/product-version.md) %}

The product's first version will be sent for moderation to {{ yandex-cloud }}. After it passes moderation, you'll get an email confirming that your product is available to users in the Marketplace public catalog.
