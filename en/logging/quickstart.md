# Getting started

In this tutorial, you'll add records to a [log group](concepts/log-group.md) and then view them.

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

To get started in {{ yandex-cloud }}:

1. Log in to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). If you aren't registered, go to the management console and follow the instructions.
1. [On the billing page]({{ link-console-billing }}), make sure that a [billing account](../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) is linked and that its status is `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE`. If you don't have a billing account, [create one](../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. If you don't have a folder, [create one](../resource-manager/operations/folder/create.md).

## Add records to a log group

{% include [write-logs](../_includes/logging/write-logs.md) %}
