# Log group

_A log group_ is a way of grouping logs of services and custom messages. There are two types of groups:

* Default. A default log group is created for each folder. Logs of {{ sf-name }} and {{ api-gw-name }} are automatically put into this group. You can send logs to the default log group yourself.
* Custom. You can create a log group and enable logging to it yourself. [How to create a custom log group.](../operations/create-group.md)
