# Searching for events in audit logs

This tutorial provides common [requests, filters, and commands](examples.md) you can use to get events from the audit logs of {{ yandex-cloud }} resources with the help of the following [tools](tools.md):

* {{ yq-full-name }}
* {{ cloud-logging-full-name }}
* jq

You can test event search in audit logs using [this example](query.md), where a {{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket with audit logs is connected to {{ yq-name }}.
