# Adding records

{% note info %}

You can create a trigger that will launch a [function](../../functions/concepts/function.md) in {{ sf-name }} or a [container](../../serverless-containers/concepts/container.md) in {{ serverless-containers-name }} when records are added to the log group. Read more about [triggers for {{ cloud-logging-name }}](../../functions/operations/trigger/cloud-logging-trigger-create.md).
