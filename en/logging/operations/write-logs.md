# Adding records

{% note info %}

You can create a trigger that will invoke a [function](../../functions/operations/trigger/cloud-logging-trigger-create.md) in {{ sf-name }} or run a [container](../../serverless-containers/operations/cloud-logging-trigger-create.md) in {{ serverless-containers-name }} whenever records are added to the log group.

{% endnote %}

{% include [write-logs](../../_includes/logging/write-logs.md) %}
