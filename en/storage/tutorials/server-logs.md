# Number of object queries

This scenario describes the steps required to retrieve query statistics for {{ objstorage-name }} objects using the [S3 Select](../concepts/s3-select-language.md) query language.

{% note info %}

To get information on object queries, [enable logging](../operations/buckets/enable-logging.md#enable).

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

1. Install and configure the [AWS CLI](../tools/aws-cli.md).
1. Download and install the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) utility.

## Getting query statistics {#request-stat}

1. Run the query against {{ objstorage-name }} and save the output to a file:

    1. For convenience, save:

        * The name of the bucket storing the object with the logs, in a variable called `$bucket`:

            ```bash
            bucket=<bucket_name>
            ```

        * The [key](../concepts/object.md#key) of the object containing the logs, to a variable called `$key`:

            ```bash
            key=<object_key>
            ```

        * The S3 Select expression to select object data, to a variable called `$query`:

            ```bash
            query='<query_expression>'
            ```

            Sample expressions:

             * Retrieving queries by response code:

                ```sql
                SELECT "timestamp", request_id, handler, object_key, status, request_time
                FROM S3Object
                WHERE status >= 400
                ```

             * Searching for long-running queries:

                ```sql
                SELECT "timestamp", request_id, handler, object_key, status, request_time
                FROM S3Object
                WHERE request_time >= 1000
                ```

             * Average time for processing queries (using [aggregate functions](../concepts/s3-select-language.md#aggregate-functions) `AVG`):

                ```sql
                SELECT AVG(request_time) AS "avg" FROM S3Object
                ```

    1. Run the command:

        ```bash
        aws --endpoint https://{{ s3-storage-host }} s3api select-object-content \
          --bucket $bucket \
          --key $key \
          --expression "$query" \
          --expression-type 'SQL' \
          --input-serialization '{"JSON":{"Type":"LINES"}}' \
          --output-serialization '{"JSON":{}}' \
          "output.json"
        ```

1. If a query uses no aggregate functions, output the number of queries for each object key. To do this, run an aggregation query using the `jq` utility:

    ```bash
    jq .object_key output.json | uniq -c | sort -nr
    ```

    Result:

    ```bash
    9 "path/logs/2021-02-10-22-02-25-199f57b5-5601-3210-5d9a-1apl1e5z6b4f"
    7 "path/logs/2021-01-28-11-40-11-580g57b5-9903-1108-6a7a-1ghj1e0e8b0f"
    3 "path/logs/2020-12-09-10-05-31-123f57b5-1853-4120-8d7a-5bcc1e9e9b4f"
    1 "path/logs/2020-12-09-08-11-10-123f57b5-1773-9310-1d2a-5bcc1e9e9b4f"
    1 "path/logs/2020-12-01-14-42-11-493f57b5-1093-4120-8d7a-5bcc1e9e9b4f"
    ```
