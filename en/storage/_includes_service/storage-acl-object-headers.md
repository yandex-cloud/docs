The value for an `X-Amz-Grant-*` header is a comma-separated list of access grantees. Each access grantee is identified in a structure like `<access grantee type>:<access grantee ID>`. {{ objstorage-name }} supports the following types of access grantees:
* `id` — access grantee — cloud user.
* `uri` — access grantee — system group.

Example:

```
X-Amz-Grant-Read: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/AuthenticatedUsers"
```
