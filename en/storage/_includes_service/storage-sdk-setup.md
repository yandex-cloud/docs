To configure the SDK, create configuration files in your home folder and set the following in them:

- The static key in the file `.aws/credentials`:

   ```
   [default]
               aws_access_key_id = <id>
               aws_secret_access_key = <secretKey>
   ```

- The default region in the file `.aws/config`:

   ```
   [default]
               region=ru-central1
   ```

   {% note info %}

   Some apps designed to work with Amazon S3 don't let you set the region, so {{ objstorage-name }} also accepts the value `us-east-1`.

   {% endnote %}

Use the `{{ s3-storage-host }}` address to access {{ objstorage-name }}.
