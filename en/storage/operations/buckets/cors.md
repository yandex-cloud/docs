# Configuring CORS

{{ objstorage-name }} lets you manage [CORS configurations](../../concepts/cors.md) in buckets.

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. In the management console, go to the bucket you want to configure CORS for.
  1. In the left pane, select **CORS**.
  1. Click **Configure CORS**.
  1. A page opens where you can add, delete, and edit configuration rules. For a detailed description of the configuration fields, see [{#T}](../../s3/api-ref/cors/xml-config.md).

- AWS CLI

  To upload a configuration via the AWS CLI:

  1. Describe the CORS configuration of objects in JSON format. For example:

     ```json
     {
       "CORSRules": [
         {
           "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
           "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "DELETE"],
           "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000,
           "AllowedOrigins": ["*"]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

     When you're done, you can save your configuration as a file, for example, `cors.json`.

  1. Upload the configuration to a bucket, for example, `shared-bucket`:

     ```bash
     aws s3api put-bucket-cors \
       --bucket shared-bucket \
       --cors-configuration file://cors.json \
       --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }}
     ```

- Terraform

  {% include [terraform-install](../../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

  Get [static access keys](../../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md): a private key and key ID used for authentication in {{ objstorage-short-name }}.

  1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:
     * `access_key`: The ID of the static access key.
     * `secret_key`: The value of the private access key.
     * `bucket`: Bucket name. Required parameter.
     * `acl`: The ACL policy applied. Optional.

     `CORS` parameters:
     * `allowed_headers`: Headers allowed. Optional.
     * `allowed_methods`: Methods allowed. Possible values: `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`, or `HEAD`. Required parameter.
     * `allowed_origins`: Website that allows sending cross-domain requests to a bucket. Required parameter.
     * `expose_headers`: Header that can be displayed in a JavaScript app in the browser. Optional.
     * `max_age_seconds`: Time in seconds during which the results of requests to an object are cached by the browser. Optional.
     * `server_side_encryption_configuration`: Bucket encryption settings on the server side. Optional.

     ```hcl
     provider "yandex" {
       cloud_id  = "<cloud ID>"
       folder_id = "<folder ID>"
       zone      = "<availability zone>"
       token     = "<OAuth token>"
       }
     
     resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "b" {
       bucket = "s3-website-test.hashicorp.com"
       acl    = "public-read"
     
       access_key = "<key ID>"
       secret_key = "<secret key>"
     
       cors_rule {
         allowed_headers = ["*"]
         allowed_methods = ["PUT", "POST"]
         allowed_origins = ["https://s3-website-test.hashicorp.com"]
         expose_headers  = ["ETag"]
         max_age_seconds = 3000
       }
     }
     ```

     For more information about the resources you can create using Terraform, see the [provider documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/yandex/index.html).

  1. Make sure that the configuration files are correct.

     1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.

     1. Run the check using the command:

        ```bash
        terraform plan
        ```

     If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal displays a list of created resources and their parameters. If there are errors in the configuration, Terraform points them out.

  1. Deploy the cloud resources.

     1. If the configuration doesn't contain any errors, run the command:

        ```bash
        terraform apply
        ```

     1. Confirm that you want to create the resources.

     Afterwards, all the necessary resources are created in the specified folder. You can check resource availability and their settings in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
