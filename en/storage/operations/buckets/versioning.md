# Managing bucket versioning

[Bucket versioning](../../concepts/versioning.md) is the capability to store the history of an object using versions.

{% note info %}

Enabling versioning is irreversible: you can't disable versioning, but you can pause the creation of new versions. After you pause versioning, new objects are saved as `null` versions.

{% endnote %}

Enable bucket versioning:

{% list tabs %}

- AWS CLI

   If you don't have the AWS CLI yet, [install and configure it](../../tools/aws-cli.md).

   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
     s3api put-bucket-versioning \
     --bucket <bucket_name> \
     --versioning-configuration 'Status=Enabled'
   ```

- {{ TF }}

   {% include [terraform-install](../../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

   Retrieve {% if audience != "internal" %}[static access keys](../../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md){% else %}static access keys{% endif %}: a static key and a key ID used to authenticate in {{ objstorage-short-name }}.

   In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:

   ```hcl
   resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "b" {
     bucket = "<bucket name>"
     access_key = "<key ID>"
     secret_key = "<secret key>"
     acl    = "private"

     versioning {
       enabled = true
     }
   }
   ```

  Where:

  * `bucket`: Bucket name. Required parameter.
  * `access_key`: The ID of the static access key.
  * `secret_key`: The value of the secret access key.
  * `acl`: The ACL policy applied. Defaults to `private`. Optional.
  * `versioning`: Bucket versioning management:
    * `enabled`: Enables bucket versioning. Optional.
