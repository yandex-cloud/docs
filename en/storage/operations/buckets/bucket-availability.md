# Enabling public access for bucket operations

By default, buckets are created with restricted [access](../../concepts/bucket.md#bucket-access). You can use the management console to enable public access:

{% include [storage-public-operations](../../_includes_service/storage-public-operations.md) %}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the appropriate folder.
   1. Select **{{ objstorage-name }}**.
   1. Click the name of the desired bucket.
   1. Go to the **Settings** tab.
   1. Select the type of access for bucket operations.
   1. Click **Save**.

- {{ TF }}

   {% include [terraform-definition](../../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}

   
   If you don't have {{ TF }}, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).


   To enable public access to bucket operations:

   1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and add a section called `anonymous_access_flags` to the bucket description fragment.

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "log_bucket" {
        access_key = "<static_key_ID>"
        secret_key = "<private_key>"
        bucket     = "my-tf-log-bucket"

        anonymous_access_flags {
          read = true
          list = false
        }
      }
      ```

      Where:
      * `access_key`: The ID of the static access key.
      * `secret_key`: The value of the secret access key.
      * `read`: Read access to bucket objects.
      * `list`: Access to list of bucket objects.

      For more information about `yandex_storage_bucket` resource parameters in {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/storage_bucket#bucket-anonymous-access-flags).

   1. Make sure that the configuration files are correct.

      1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run the check using the command:

         ```
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal displays a list of created resources and their parameters. If the configuration contain errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Deploy the cloud resources.

      1. If the configuration doesn't contain any errors, run the command:

         ```
         terraform apply
         ```

      1. Confirm the resource creation: type `yes` in the terminal and press **Enter**.

         Afterwards, all the necessary resources are created in the specified folder. You can check that the resources are there with the correct settings using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
