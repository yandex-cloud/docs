- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder you want to delete a bucket from.
   1. Select **{{ objstorage-name }}**. This opens a page with a list of buckets.
   1. To delete a single bucket, click ![image](../../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) to the left of the bucket name and select **Delete**.
   1. Confirm the deletion.

- {{ TF }}

   {% include [terraform-definition](../../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}

   
   For more information about the {{ TF }}, [see the documentation](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).


   To delete a bucket created with {{ TF }}:

   1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and delete the fragment describing the bucket.

      {% cut "Example bucket description in a {{ TF }} configuration" %}

      ```hcl
      ...
      resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "test" {
        access_key = "YCAJEX9Aw2ge1VKjlYXf-w-lJ"
        secret_key = "YCONxG7rSdzVF9UMxLA_NRy5VbKzKlqZMcSJz2N0"
        bucket     = "tf-test-bucket"
      }
      ...
      ```

      {% endcut %}

   1. In the command line, go to the directory with the {{ TF }} configuration file.

   1. Check the configuration using the command:

      ```
      terraform validate
      ```

      If the configuration is correct, the following message is returned:

      ```
      Success! The configuration is valid.
      ```

   1. Run the command:

      ```
      terraform plan
      ```

      The terminal will display a list of resources with parameters. No changes are made at this step. If the configuration contain errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Apply the configuration changes:

      ```
      terraform apply
      ```

   1. Confirm the changes: type `yes` into the terminal and press **Enter**.

      You can verify the changes in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
