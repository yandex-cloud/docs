# Deleting all objects in a bucket

To clear a bucket and not [pay](../../pricing.md) for storage:

{% list tabs %}

- AWS CLI

  1. Create a variable containing the bucket name:

     ```bash
     BUCKET_NAME=<bucket name>
     ```

  1. Delete all versions of objects from the bucket:

     ```bash
     aws s3api delete-objects \
       --endpoint-url https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \ 
       --bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
       --delete \
         "$(aws s3api list-object-versions \
           --endpoint-url https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
           --bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
           --query '{Objects: Versions[].{Key: Key, VersionId: VersionId}}' \
           --max-items 1000)"
     ```

     Command output:

     ```json
     {
         "Deleted": [
             {
                 "Key": "object_000",
                 "VersionId": "0005CDD3521954A6"
             },
             {
                 "Key": "object_001",
                 "VersionId": "0005CDD3523B6ADB"
             },
             ...
         ]
     }
     ```

     With this command, you can delete up to 1000 versions of objects: this is related to restrictions for the `aws s3api delete-objects` operation. If there are more versions in the bucket, run the command several times.

  1. If the bucket has [versioning](../../concepts/versioning.md) enabled, delete all the delete markers:

     ```bash
     aws s3api delete-objects \
       --endpoint-url https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
       --bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
       --delete \
         "$(aws s3api list-object-versions \
           --endpoint-url https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
           --bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
           --query '{Objects: DeleteMarkers[].{Key: Key, VersionId: VersionId}}' \
           --max-items 1000)"
     ```

     Command output:

     ```json
     {
         "Deleted": [
             {
                 "Key": "object_034",
                 "DeleteMarker": true,
                 "DeleteMarkerVersionId": "0005CDD35274A467"
             },
             {
                 "Key": "object_057",
                 "DeleteMarker": true,
                 "DeleteMarkerVersionId": "0005CDD3528B1BC3"
             },
             ...
         ]
     }
     ```

     With this command, you can delete up to 1000 delete markers: this is related to restrictions for the `aws s3api delete-objects` operation. If there are more versions in the bucket, run the command several times.

  1. Delete partially uploaded objects:

     ```bash
     aws s3api list-multipart-uploads \
       --endpoint-url https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \ 
       --bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
     | jq -r '.Uploads[] | "--key \"\(.Key)\" --upload-id \(.UploadId)"' \
     | while read -r line; do
       eval 
         "aws s3api abort-multipart-upload \
           --endpoint-url https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
           --bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
           $line";
     done
     ```

  1. Get a list of object parts remaining in the bucket:

     ```bash
     aws s3api list-multipart-uploads \
       --endpoint-url https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \ 
       --bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
     | jq -r '.Uploads[] | "--key \"\(.Key)\" --upload-id \(.UploadId)"' \
     | while read -r line; do
       eval 
         "aws s3api list-parts \
           --endpoint-url https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
           --bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
           $line";
     done
     ```

     The list may contain parts of objects that began uploading before and finished uploading after the previous step executed. If the list is not empty, repeat steps 4 and 5.

- Python 3 (boto3)

  Run the following code:

  ```python
  import boto3
  
  bucket_name = '<bucket name>'
  s3 = boto3.resource('s3',
      endpoint_url='https://{{ s3-storage-host }}',
      aws_access_key_id='<key ID>',
      aws_secret_access_key='<secret key>')
  bucket = s3.Bucket(bucket_name)
  
  # Deleting all versions (works for non-versioned buckets too).
  bucket.object_versions.delete()
  
  # Aborting all multipart uploads, which also deletes all parts.
  for multipart_upload in bucket.multipart_uploads.iterator():
      # Part uploads that are currently in progress may or may not succeed,
      # so it might be necessary to abort a multipart upload multiple times.
      while len(list(multipart_upload.parts.all())) > 0:
          multipart_upload.abort()
  ```

{% endlist %}
