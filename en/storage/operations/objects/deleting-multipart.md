# Deleting a partially uploaded object

You can upload an object in parts using [multipart upload](../../concepts/multipart.md).

{% include [auto-delete-all-multipart](../../../_includes/storage/auto-delete-all-multipart.md) %}

To manually delete a partially uploaded object:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}
  
  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_storage }}** from the list of services.
  1. In the row with the bucket, in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.storage.buckets.column_count }}** column, hover over the yellow field with the number of partially uploaded objects.
  1. In the window that opens, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.storage.buckets.button_open-multipart-uploads }}**.
  1. Select incomplete uploads you want to delete.
  1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.delete }}**.
  1. Confirm the deletion.

  In the management console, the information about the number of objects and storage space used in the bucket is updated with a few minutes' delay.

- {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. Get a list of incomplete multipart uploads:

      1. See the description of the CLI command to get a list of incomplete multipart uploads in a bucket:

          ```bash
          yc storage s3api list-multipart-uploads --help
          ```

      1. {% include [bucket-list-cli](../../../_includes/storage/bucket-list-cli.md) %}
      1. Run the command below by specifying the bucket name:

          ```bash
          yc storage s3api list-multipart-uploads \
            --bucket <bucket_name>
          ```

          Result:

          ```yaml
          bucket: first-bucket
          max_uploads: "1000"
          uploads:
            - key: video.mp4
              upload_id: 000629B7********
              initiator:
                id: ajeol2afu1js********
                display_name: ajeol2afu1js********
              owner:
                id: ajeol2afu1js********
                display_name: ajeol2afu1js********
              storage_class: STANDARD
              initiated_at: "2024-12-20T18:05:07.312Z"
            - key: video1.mp4
              upload_id: 000629B7********
              initiator:
                id: ajeol2afu1js********
                display_name: ajeol2afu1js********
              owner:
                id: ajeol2afu1js********
                display_name: ajeol2afu1js********
              storage_class: STANDARD
              initiated_at: "2024-12-20T18:20:15.747Z"
          request_id: 75dbac97********
          ```

          Save the multipart upload ID (`uploads.upload_id`) value of the partially uploaded object you want to delete. You will need this value in the next step.

          For more information about the `yc storage s3api list-multipart-uploads` command, see the [CLI reference](../../../cli/cli-ref/storage/cli-ref/s3api/list-multipart-uploads.md).

  1. Delete the partially uploaded object:

      1. See the description of the CLI command to delete a partially uploaded object:

          ```bash
          yc storage s3api abort-multipart-upload --help
          ```
      1. Run this command:

          ```bash
          yc storage s3api abort-multipart-upload \
            --bucket <bucket_name> \
            --key <object_key> \
            --upload-id <multipart_upload_ID>
          ```

          Where:

          * `--bucket`: Name of the bucket in which you want to delete the partially uploaded object.
          * `--key`: [Key](../../concepts/object.md#key) of the object to delete.
          * `--upload-id`: Multipart upload ID obtained in the previous step.

          Result:

          ```text
          request_id: 573ea6e2********
          ```

          For more information about the `yc storage s3api abort-multipart-upload` command, see the [CLI reference](../../../cli/cli-ref/storage/cli-ref/s3api/abort-multipart-upload.md).

            }
          }
          ```

      1. Run the command below by specifying the bucket name:

          ```bash
          aws s3api list-multipart-uploads \
            --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
            --bucket <bucket_name>
          ```

          Result:

          ```json
          {
            "Uploads": [

            "RequestCharged": null
          }
          ```

          Save the multipart upload ID (`Uploads.UploadId`) value of the partially uploaded object you want to delete. You will need this value in the next step.

  1. Delete the partially uploaded object:

      ```bash
      aws s3api abort-multipart-upload \
        --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
        --bucket <bucket_name> \

      Where:

      * `--bucket`: Name of the bucket in which you want to delete the partially uploaded object.
      * `--key`: [Key](../../concepts/object.md#key) of the object to delete.
      * `--upload-id`: Multipart upload ID obtained in the previous step.

- API {#api}

  To get a list of multipart uploads, use the [listUploads](../../s3/api-ref/multipart/listuploads.md) S3 API method.

  To delete a partially uploaded object, use the [abortUpload](../../s3/api-ref/multipart/abortupload.md) S3 API method.
