# Getting a download link

If you have a public bucket, its objects are always available. You can get a link by following these instructions or generate one yourself. [Read more about the link format](../../concepts/object.md#object-url).

If you have a bucket with restricted access, {{ objstorage-name }} lets you generate a signed object link. Anyone who receives this link can download the object even from a bucket with restricted access.
