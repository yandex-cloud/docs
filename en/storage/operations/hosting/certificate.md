# Configuring HTTPS

If a bucket is used for [hosting a static website](../../concepts/hosting.md), to access the website via [HTTPS](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), you should upload your own security certificate and the applicable secret key.

{{ objstorage-name }} only supports [PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail)-encoded certificates.

{% note info %}

Access to the bucket over HTTPS is granted within thirty minutes of uploading the certificate.
