# Configuring HTTPS

If you are using a bucket to [host a static website](../../concepts/hosting.md), then to access the website via [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), you will need to upload your own security certificate and a corresponding secret key.

{{ objstorage-name }} only supports [PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail)-encoded certificates.

{% note info %}

Access to the bucket over HTTPS is granted within thirty minutes of uploading the certificate.
