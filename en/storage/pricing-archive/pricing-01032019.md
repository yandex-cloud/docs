## Pricing {#prices}

### Data storage {#prices-storage}

Prices are given for a 30-day month. For shorter months, the price is higher. For longer months, it's lower.

| Service | Cost of 1 GB per month, without VAT | Cost of 1 GB per month, with VAT |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Standard storage | 1.0508 ₽ | 1.2610 ₽ |
| Cold storage | 0.5593 ₽ | 0.6712 ₽ |

Example of a proportional calculation: let's say the user stores 15 GB of data for 11.5 hours during a 30-day month. The total cost of storage can be calculated using the formula:

```
Storage_cost = Cost_per_GB_per_month * 15 * 11.5 / 24 / 30
```
