# Pricing policy for {{ objstorage-name }} from January 1 to March 1, 2019

This was the old version of the pricing policy that was in effect between January 1 and March 1, 2019. For the current {{ objstorage-name }} pricing policy, see [{#T}](../pricing.md).

## What goes into the cost of using {{ objstorage-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ objstorage-name }} usage cost is based on:

- The amount of storage used by your data.
- The number of operations on your data.
- The amount of outgoing traffic

Users can access:

- Cold storage: A low price for data storage and a high price for operations. It's optimal for storing a large volume of data and a small number of operations.
- Standard storage: A high rate for data storage and a low rate for operations. It's optimal for storing small amounts of data and performing a large number of operations.

### Using storage {#rules-storage}

Storage usage is measured in GB per month. The volume of data stored during a month is the average value over the month based on granulated per-second data. The minimum billable unit is 1 hour of storing 1 MB of data.

### Performing operations with data {#rules-operations}


Data operations are charged according to the following policy:
- The minimum pricing unit for PUT and POST operations is 10.
- The minimum billable unit for GET and HEAD operations is 100.
- You aren't charged for deleting data (the DELETE operation).


## Pricing {#prices}

### Data storage {#prices-storage}

Prices are given for a 30-day month. For shorter months, the price is higher. For longer months, it's lower.

| Service | Cost of 1 GB per month, without VAT | Cost of 1 GB per month, with VAT |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Standard storage | 1.0508 ₽ | 1.2610 ₽ |
| Cold storage | 0.5593 ₽ | 0.6712 ₽ |

Example of proportional calculation: let's say the user stores 15 GB of data for 11.5 hours during a 30-day month. The total cost of storage can be calculated using the formula:

```
Storage_cost = Cost_per_GB_per_month * 15 * 11.5 / 24 / 30
```

### Data operations {#prices-operations}

| Service | Cost, rubles without VAT | Cost, rubles with VAT |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Standard storage** |  |
| 1000 PUT or POST operations | 0.2542 ₽ | 0.3051 ₽ |
