## Pricing {#prices}

### Data storage {#prices-storage}

Prices are specified for a 30-day month. For shorter months, the price is higher. For longer months, it is lower.

| Service | Cost of 1 GB per month, without VAT | Cost of 1 GB per month, with VAT |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Standard storage | 1.0508 ₽ | 1.2610 ₽ |
| Cold storage | 0.5593 ₽ | 0.6712 ₽ |

Here is an example of proportional calculation: let's say the user stores 15 GB of data for 11.5 hours during a month that is 30 days long. The total cost of storage can be calculated using the formula:

```
Storage_cost = Cost_per_GB_per_month * 15 * 11.5 / 24 / 30
```

### Operations with data {#prices-operations}

| Service | Cost, rubles without VAT | Cost, rubles with VAT |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
