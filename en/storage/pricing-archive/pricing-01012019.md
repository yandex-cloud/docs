### Performing operations on data {#rules-operations}

Operations on data are rated according to the rules:

  - The minimum pricing unit for PUT operations is 10.
  - The minimum pricing unit for GET and HEAD operations is 100.
  - You are not charged for deleting data (the DELETE operation).

## Prices until January 1, 2019 {#prices-old}

### Data storage {#prices-storage-old}

Prices are specified for a 30-day month. For shorter months, the price is higher. For longer months, it is lower.

| Service | Cost of 1 GB per month, without VAT | Cost of 1 GB per month, with VAT |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Standard storage | ₽1.0508 | ₽1.2400 |
| Cold storage | ₽0.5593 | ₽0.6600 |

Here is an example of proportional calculation: let's say the user stores 15 GB of data for 11.5 hours during a month that is 30 days long. The total cost of storage can be calculated using the formula:

```
Storage_cost = Cost_per_GB_per_month * 15 * 11.5 / 24 / 30
```

### Operations on data {#prices-operations-old}

| Service | Cost, rubles without VAT | Cost, rubles with VAT |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Standard storage** |  |
| 1,000 PUT or POST operations | ₽0.2542 | ₽0.3000 |
| 10,000 GET or HEAD operations | ₽0.2034 | ₽0.2400 |
| **Cold storage** |  |
| 1,000 PUT or POST operations | ₽0.6186 | ₽0.7300 |
