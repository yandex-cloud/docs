# Object backup

{{ objstorage-name }} ensures reliable storage of your uploaded objects in a replicated store, but doesn't provide dedicated backup tools.

If you want to store backup copies of your objects, you can regularly download the objects you need from {{ objstorage-name }} and store them in your own infrastructure or other cloud storage.

To automate the backup process, use [tools supported by the service](../tools/index.md).
