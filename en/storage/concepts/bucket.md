# Bucket

A logical entity that helps store objects.

## Naming buckets {#naming}

A bucket's name is used as part of the data access URL and is visible to your users. For example, `https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/bucket-name`.

Naming rules:

- Bucket names are unique throughout {{ objstorage-name }}, so you can't create two buckets with the same name (even in different folders in different clouds). Keep this in mind if you plan to create buckets automatically via the API.

- Bucket names are subject to the following restrictions:

   {% include [bucket-name-reqs](../../_includes/bucket-name-reqs.md) %}

When selecting a bucket name, please keep in mind that names containing dots are used for [hosting static websites](hosting.md). You may encounter a name conflict that prevents you or another user from hosting a website in Object Storage.

## Bucket URL {#bucket-url}

You can use the following URL format to access a bucket:

- `https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/<bucket>?<parameters>`
- `http://<bucket>.{{ s3-storage-host }}?<parameters>`

{% include [storage-dotnet-host](../_includes_service/storage-dotnet-host.md) %}

## Accessing a bucket via HTTPS {#bucket-https}

{{ objstorage-name }} supports secure connections over [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). When accessing your buckets, use URLs in the format `https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/<bucket>?<parameters>`.

When you use URLs in the format `http://<bucket>.{{ s3-storage-host }}?<parameters>` HTTPS isn't available.

Read about HTTPS support when hosting websites in {{ objstorage-name }} under [{#T}](hosting.md).

## Bucket settings {#bucket-settings}

You can:

- [Limit the maximum size of a bucket](../operations/buckets/limit-max-volume.md).

    {{ objstorage-name }} doesn't let you upload objects if adding them exceeds the maximum bucket size.

- Set the default [storage class](storage-class.md).

     Objects uploaded to a bucket are by default saved with the storage class specified for that bucket.

- Configure a bucket for [static website hosting](hosting.md).

- Download a [CORS configuration](cors.md) for a bucket.

- Set up [object lifecycles](lifecycles.md).

## Bucket access {#bucket-access}

By default, buckets are created with restricted access, which is defined in the [IAM](../../iam/concepts/index.md) settings. You can use the management console to [enable public access](../operations/buckets/bucket-availability.md):

{% include [storage-public-operations](../_includes_service/storage-public-operations.md) %}

If necessary, you can configure permissions to the buckets and objects they contain using the [ACL](acl.md).

## Guidelines and limitations {#details-of-usage}

- A bucket can't be renamed.

- {{ objstorage-name }} performance doesn't depend on the number of buckets. You can store all your data in one or several buckets.

- Buckets can't be nested.

- You can only delete an empty bucket.

- It may take some time after deleting a bucket before you can create a new bucket with the same name. There is also a risk that another Yandex.Cloud user will create a bucket with the name you've released before you claim it again. Don't delete buckets without a reason.

- When objects are uploaded in quick succession, the maximum specified bucket size can be exceeded.

- After deleting objects from a bucket, their storage capacity is considered occupied for some time.

  {% note info %}

  If you limit the maximum size of a bucket, it may remain unavailable for writes for some time, even if you free up enough space for new objects.
