# Uploading a file via an HTML form

This section describes how to upload files from the browser to {{ objstorage-name }} using an HTML form.

{% note info %}

Objects larger than 5 GB cannot be uploaded using a form (see [{#T}](limits.md)).
All form fields after the `file` field are ignored.

{% endnote %}


## Overview {#common-dscr}

If you want to allow your service users to upload files to your bucket directly from the browser:

1. Develop an HTML form with everything you need to send a request to {{ objstorage-name }} and place it on a page in your service.
2. The user opens your service page from the browser and uses the form to upload their file to storage.

To set rules and restrictions for file uploads, attach your security policy to the form. You do not need a policy when your bucket is publicly available for writing with no restrictions.

To create a form, follow these steps:

1. Develop a [security policy](#policy) to describe the parameters of the request to {{ objstorage-name }}. For example, your policy may set a limit on the uploaded object size.
2. Generate a [signature](#signing-policy) based on the security policy.
3. Create an [HTML form](#html-form) with a signed security policy you will provide your users with when uploading files.

## HTML form {#html-form}

Generic layout of an HTML page with an upload form:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        ...
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
        ...
    </head>
    <body>
        ...
        <form action="https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/{bucket-name}" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            ...
            <input .../>
            ...
        </form>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
```

The HTML form is defined by the `<form>` tag and consists of a declaration and fields.

The form declaration contains the following attributes:

* `action`: URL of the bucket where the object is to be uploaded.
* `method`: HTTP method with the `POST` value.
* `enctype`: Request content type. The value is `multipart/form-data`.

The [form fields](#form-fields) contain a detailed description of the request to {{ objstorage-name }} and the [restrictions](#policy) that apply to it.

The form and its fields must be UTF-8 encoded. To achieve this, set the `charset` attribute for the `<meta>` tag of your page to `UTF-8`:

```
<html>
    <head>
        ...
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
        ...
```

### Form fields {#form-fields}

{{ objstorage-name }} supports form signing based on AWS Signature V2 and V4. The chosen signature method determines the set of fields in the form and their names. AWS Signature V2 is only supported for compatibility reasons. Avoid using it if possible.

Generic form layout:

- AWS Signature V4

     ```html
     <form action="https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/{bucket-name}" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">

        <!-- Fields after file are ignored -->
        <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Upload" />
    </form>
    ```

  ```html
   <form action="https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/{bucket-name}" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        Key in storage:
        <input type="input" name="key" value="object_key" />
        <!-- Request properties -->
        <input type="hidden" name="AWSAccessKeyId" value="access_key_id" />
        <input type="hidden" name="acl" value="access_type" />
        <input type="hidden" name="success_action_redirect" value="url" />
        <input type="hidden" name="policy" value="base64-encoded-policy-document" />
        <input type="hidden" name="signature" value="signature_string" />
        <input type="hidden" name="Content-Type" value="content/type" />
        <!-- Other required fields -->
        File to upload:
        <input type="file" name="file" /> <br />
        <!-- Fields after "file" are ignored -->
        <br />
        <input type="submit" value="Upload the file" />
  </form>
  ```

{% endlist %}

{% note info %}

The following applies to AWS Signature V4 only.

{% endnote %}

Description of form fields:

| Field | Description | Required |
-----|----------|--------------
| `acl` | ACL for the object. You can set one of the [predefined ACLs](acl.md#predefined-acls). For example, if you want to make an object public, use `public-read`. | No |
| `Cache-Control` | Directives for caching data according to [RFC 2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9). | No |
| `Content-â€‹Disposition` | Name {{ objstorage-name }} suggests saving an object as a file under when it is downloaded. Compliant with [RFC 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1). | No |
| `Content-Encoding` | Defines the content encoding according to [RFC 2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11). | No |
| `Content-Type` | MIME type of the uploaded file. If you do not specify `Content-Type`, {{ objstorage-name }} will save the object as `application/octet-stream`. This can affect end user applications since they will not understand the file format (for example, a browser will be unable to render an image). | No |
| `Expires` | Response expiration date. Compliant with [RFC 2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21). | No |
| `key` | [Object key](object.md#key).<br/><br/>You can enter your key completely or as a template in `prefix/${filename}` format, so that, if you upload `some_file.jpg`, the final object key is `prefix/some_file.jpg`. | Yes |
| `policy` | [Security policy](#policy) defining request permissions. Requests without a policy are treated as anonymous and are only processed for buckets with public write access. | Conditional |
| `X-Amz-Signature` | Signature of the policy that has to be generated using the secret key.<br/><br/>It is required if the form has a security policy. | Conditional |
| `success_action_redirect` | URL the user is redirected to when the file is successfully uploaded. If the value is not set, {{ objstorage-name }} returns the response specified in the `success_action_status` field. | No |
| `success_action_status` | The response status after a successful upload.<br/><br/>If `success_action_redirect` is not specified, {{ objstorage-name }} returns `success_action_status`. The response body is empty.<br/><br/>The acceptable values are 200 and 204 (default). | No |
| `X-Amz-Algorithm` | Security policy signature algorithm. The value is `AWS4-HMAC-SHA256`.<br/><br/>This field is required if the form has a security policy. | Conditional |
| `X-Amz-Credential` | Signature ID.<br/><br/>This is a string in `<access-key-id>/<date>/{{ region-id }}/s3/aws4_request` format, where `<date>` must match the `X-Amz-Date` field value and the date used to sign the policy.<br/><br/>This field is required if the form has a security policy. | Conditional |
| `X-Amz-Date` | Date in ISO8601 format, for example, `20180719T000000Z`. It must match the date in the `X-Amz-Credential` field (by value rather than by format) and the date used to sign the policy.<br/><br/>This field is required if the form has a security policy. | Conditional |
| `X-Amz-Storage-Class` | [Storage class](storage-class.md) for the object. With an HTML form, you can only put an object in a standard storage. | No |
| `X-Amz-Meta-*` | User-defined object metadata.<br/><br/>{{ objstorage-name }} considers all headers starting with `X-Amz-Meta-` as user-defined and does not process them. Instead, it saves them in their original format.<br/><br/>The total size of user-defined headers must not exceed 2 KB. The size of user-defined data is determined as the length of the UTF-8 encoded string. The header names and their values are included when calculating the size. | No |
| `X-Amz-Website-` `redirect-location` | If the bucket is configured as a [website](hosting.md), this field sets a redirect from the specified object to any other object in the bucket or any URL on the web. The redirect is stored in the object metadata. | No |
| `file` | Input field that allows the user to select a file to upload. This field must be the last field in the form. All fields provided after `file` are ignored. You cannot upload more than one file in a single request. | Yes |


## Security policy {#policy}

The HTML form contains a security policy that puts restrictions on uploadable files.

The security policy is a JSON document that may look as follows:

```json
{
    "expiration": "timestamp",
    "conditions": [
        {"bucket": "bucket-name"},
        ["starts-with", "$key", "users-uploads/"],
        {"acl": "public-read"},
        {"success_action_redirect": "http://localhost/"},
        ["starts-with", "$Content-Type", ""],
        ["content-length-range", 0, 1048576]
    ]
}
```

The `expiration` field contains the policy expiration date in [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, e.g., `2019-07-22T15:39:36Z`. When the policy expires, {{ objstorage-name }} no longer accepts any files uploaded from the form.

The `conditions` field contains a set of rules for the form fields. At least one rule must be specified for each form field.

Security policy rules can be of the following types:

| Rule type | Description |
------------|-----------
| Exact match | The form field value must be exactly the same as in the policy, e.g., `{"acl": "public-read"}`.<br/><br/> You can also use the alternative format: `["eq", "$acl", "public-read" ]`. |
| Partial match | The form field value must start with the string specified in the policy, e.g., `["starts-with", "$key", "key_prefix"]`.<br/><br/> If an empty string is specified as a value, the field can take any value, e.g., `["starts-with", "$Content-Type", ""]`.<br/><br/> |
| `content-length-range` | Size limit of the object to upload, e.g., `["content-length-range", 0, 1048576]`.<br/><br/> |

Possible restrictions:

| Element | Restriction type | Restriction scope |
--------|-----------------|---------------------
| `acl` | Exact and partial match. | `acl` field in the form. |
| `bucket` | Exact and partial match. | Bucket name. |
| `content-length-range` | `content-length-range` | `content-length-range` |
| `key` | Exact and partial match. | `key` field in the form. It allows you to set the object key or prefix. |
| `success_action_redirect` | Exact and partial match. | `success_action_redirect` field in the form. |
| `success_action_status` | Exact and partial match. | `success_action_status` field in the form. |
| `X-Amz-*` | Exact match. | `X-Amz-*` fields in the form, except `X-Amz-Meta-*`. |
| `X-Amz-Meta-*` | Exact and partial match. | `X-Amz-Meta-*` fields in the form. |
| `Cache-Control`<br/>`Content-Disposition`<br/>`Content-Encoding`<br/>`Content-Type`<br/>`Expires` | Exact and partial match. | Form fields with the same names. |

If `key` is a template field, the policy is applied after the user-specified file name is put into the template.

### Security policy signature {#signing-policy}

The common policy [signature algorithm](../s3/signing-requests.md) is the following:

1. Encode the policy JSON document in [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).
2. [Generate a signing key](../s3/signing-requests.md#signing-key-gen).
3. [Generate a policy signature](../s3/signing-requests.md#signing).


## Example of generating a form using boto3 {#example-generating-form}

The input conditions are as follows:

- Files must be saved in the `user-data` bucket with the `/users/upload/` prefix.
- Uploaded objects are publicly accessible for reading.
- If the upload is successful, the user is redirected to `https://example.com`.

To generate form fields, we will use [boto3](../tools/boto.md) SDK for Python:

```python
aws_access_key_id = 'JK38EXAMP********'
aws_secret_access_key = 'ExamP1eSecReTKeykdo********'
endpoint = 'https://{{ s3-storage-host }}'

s3 = boto3.client('s3',
                  aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id,
                  aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key,
                  region_name='{{ region-id }}',
                  endpoint_url=endpoint,
                  config=botocore.client.Config(signature_version='s3v4'),
                  )

key = 'users/uploads/${filename}'
bucket = 'user-data'
conditions = [{"acl":"public-read"}, ["starts-with", "$key", "users/uploads"], {'success_action_redirect': 'https://example.com'}]
fields = {'success_action_redirect': 'https://example.com'}

prepared_form_fields = s3.generate_presigned_post(Bucket=bucket,
                                                  Key=key,
                                                  Conditions=conditions,
                                                  Fields=fields,
                                                  ExpiresIn=60 * 60)


print(prepared_form_fields)
```


The script will return a JSON document in the following format:

```json
{
    'url': u'https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/user-data',
    'fields': {
        'X-Amz-Algorithm': 'AWS4-HMAC-SHA256',
        'X-Amz-Date': '20190722T153936Z',
        'success_action_redirect': 'https://example.com',
        'X-Amz-Signature': '4bdfb2209fc30744458be10bc3b99361f2f50add20f2ca2425587a27********',
        'key': 'users/uploads/${filename}',
        'policy': u'eyJjb25kaXRpb25zIj...M5OjM2WiJ9',
        'X-Amz-Credential': u'JK38EXAMP********/20190722/{{ region-id }}/s3/aws4_request'}
}
```

Using the values from the returned document, you can build an HTML page with a file upload form:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <form action="https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/user-data" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            Key in storage:
            <input type="input"    name="key" value="users/uploads/${filename}" /><br />
            <input type="hidden"   name="X-Amz-Credential" value="JK38EXAMP********/20190722/{{ region-id }}/s3/aws4_request" />
            <input type="hidden"   name="acl" value="public-read" />
            <input type="hidden"   name="X-Amz-Algorithm" value="AWS4-HMAC-SHA256" />
            <input type="hidden"   name="X-Amz-Date" value="20190722T153936Z" />
            <input type="hidden"   name="success_action_redirect" value="https://example.com" />
            <input type="hidden"   name="policy" value="eyJjb25kaXRpb25zIj...M5OjM2WiJ9" />
            <input type="hidden" name="X-Amz-Signature" value="4bdfb2209fc30744458be10bc3b99361f2f50add20f2ca2425587a2722859f96" />
            File to upload:
            <input type="file"   name="file" /> <br />
            <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Upload" />
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```
