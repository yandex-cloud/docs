# S3cmd

[S3cmd](https://s3tools.org/s3cmd) is a console client (Linux, Mac) for services that support the Amazon S3 HTTP API. General procedure for running commands can be found in the [official s3cmd documentation](https://s3tools.org/usage).

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

{% include [aws-tools-prepare](../../_includes/aws-tools/aws-tools-prepare.md) %}

## Installation {#installation}

To learn how to download and install S3cmd, see the [Download](https://s3tools.org/download) section on the official website of the project.

## Setup {#setup}

To configure S3cmd, use the `s3cmd --configure` command. For a query, specify values for the following parameters:

1. `Access Key`: Enter the ID of the key that you received when generating the [static key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/access-key.md).
1. `Secret Key`: Enter the secret key that you received when generating the [static key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/access-key.md).
1. `Default Region`: Enter `{{ region-id }}`.

   {% note info %}

   To work with {{ objstorage-name }}, always specify `{{ region-id }}` as the region. A different region value may lead to an authorization error.

   {% endnote %}

1. `S3 Endpoint`: Enter `{{ s3-storage-host }}`.
1. `DNS-style bucket+hostname:port template for accessing a bucket`: Enter `%(bucket)s.{{ s3-storage-host }}`.
1. Leave the other parameter values unchanged.

The client tries to establish a connection with {{ objstorage-name }} and get a list of buckets. If successful, it will return `Success. Your access key and secret key worked fine :-)`.

The `s3cmd --configure` command saves the settings to a `~/.s3cfg` file in the format:

```
[default]
access_key = id
secret_key = secretKey
bucket_location = {{ region-id }}
host_base = {{ s3-storage-host }}
host_bucket = %(bucket)s.{{ s3-storage-host }}
```

If necessary, you can change these settings directly in the file. You can also specify settings when launching the client by using the appropriate parameters.

For the static website hosting control commands to work correctly, manually add the following parameter to the configuration file:

```
website_endpoint = http://%(bucket)s.{{ s3-web-host }}
```

## Specifics {#specifics}

- S3cmd treats {{ objstorage-name }} as a hierarchical file system and object keys look like file paths.
- By default, S3cmd uploads objects to cold storage. To specify the [storage class](../concepts/storage-class.md) when uploading an object, use the `--storage-class` key.
- By default, when uploading an object, S3cmd can send the additional header `x-amz-meta-s3cmd-attrs` with the attributes of your file (access rights, file owners, timestamps). The header value is saved in the [metadata](../concepts/object.md#metadata) of the object. You can disable the sending of attributes using the `preserve_attrs = False` parameter in the configuration file `~/.s3cfg` or using the `--no-preserve` key.

## Operation examples {#s3cmd-examples}
