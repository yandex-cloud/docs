## Condition operators {#condition-operators}

Condition operators are used to match the condition key and value in the policy against values in the request context.

### Logical operators {#bool}

Logical operators let you create conditions for matching the key against the Boolean value of `true` or `false`.

Condition operator | Description
--- | ---
`Bool` | Matches the specified Boolean value.

### Date and time operators {#date}

Date and time operators let you create conditions for matching the key against the value of the date and time.

Condition operator | Description
--- | ---
`DateEquals` | Matches the specified date.
`DateGreaterThan` | The date and time value is greater than the one specified.
`DateGreaterThanEquals` | The date and time value is equal to or greater than the one specified.
`DateLessThan` | The date and time value is less than the one specified.
`DateLessThanEquals` | The date and time value is equal to or less than the one specified.
`DateNotEquals` | Doesn't match the specified date.

### IP address operators {#ip-address}

Date and time operators let you create conditions for matching the key against the host IP or a range of IP addresses in [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) format.

Condition operator | Description
--- | ---
`IPAddress` | A specific IP address or range of IP addresses.
`NotIPAddress` | All IP addresses except the specified IP address or range of IP addresses.

### Numeric operators {#numeric}

Numeric operators let you create conditions for matching the key against an integer or decimal numeric value.

Condition operator | Description
--- | ---
`NumericEquals` | The value is equal to the one specified.
`NumericGreaterThan` | The value is greater than the one specified.
`NumericGreaterThanEquals` | The value is greater than or equal to the one specified.
`NumericLessThan` | The value is less than the one specified.
`NumericLessThanEquals` | The value is less than or equal to the one specified.
`NumericNotEquals` | The value is not equal to the one specified.

### String operators {#string}

String operators let you create conditions for matching the key against a string value.

Condition operator | Description
--- | ---
`StringEquals` | Exact match, case sensitive.
`StringEqualsIgnoreCase` | Exact match, ignore case.
`StringLike` | Match value. You can use wildcards in values:<br>- `*` – Multiple characters.<br>- `?` – One character.
`StringNotEquals` | Negated match, case sensitive.
`StringNotEqualsIgnoreCase` | Negated match, ignore case.
`StringNotLike` | Negated match. You can use wildcards in values:<br>- `*` – Multiple characters.<br>- `?` – One character.

### IfExists operator {#ifexists}

You can add `IfExists` to the end of any operator name (except the [Null](#null) condition). For example, `BoolIfExists`. Using this operator in the condition element means:
* If the policy key is present in the request context, process the key as specified in the policy.
* If the key is missing, evaluate the condition element as `true`.

### Null operator {#null}

The result of a `Null` operator is `true` if a condition key is not present in the request at the time of authorization. If the key exists and its value is not null, then `false`.
