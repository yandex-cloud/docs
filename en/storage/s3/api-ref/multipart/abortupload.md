# abortUpload method

Aborts an upload and deletes all object parts that were saved from {{ objstorage-name }}. If the abort upload request was received during the upload of any part, no result is guaranteed.

We recommend that you [get a list of parts](listparts.md) after aborting the upload and, if it is not empty, resend the request. Abort requests should be sent until the list of parts is returned empty.
