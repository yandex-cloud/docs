If the object is to be stored with user-defined metadata, it should be passed in this request.

```

### Path parameters {#path-parameters}

### Headers {#request-headers}

Use the necessary [common request headers](../common-request-headers.md) in requests.

You can also use the headers listed in the table below.

| Header | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `x-amz-meta-*` | User-defined metadata of the object.<br/><br/> {{ objstorage-name }} treats all headers starting with `x-amz-meta-` as user-defined. It doesn't process these headers, but saves them in the original format.<br/><br/>The total size of user-defined headers must not exceed 2 KB. The size of user-defined data is determined as the length of the UTF-8 encoded string. The header names and their values are included when calculating the size. |
| `x-amz-storage-class` | Object storage class.<br/><br/>Possible values:<br/>- `STANDARD` for uploading an object to standard storage.<br/>- `COLD`, `STANDARD_IA`, and `NEARLINE` for uploading an object to cold storage.<br/><br/>If the header is omitted, the object is saved to the storage specified in the bucket settings. |

By using the headers listed below, you can set the [ACL](../../../concepts/acl.md) for an object to be uploaded.

{% include [storage-acl-headers](../../../_includes_service/storage-acl-object-headers.md) %}
