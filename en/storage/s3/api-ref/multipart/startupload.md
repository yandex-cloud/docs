### Headers {#request-headers}

Use the necessary [common request headers](../common-request-headers.md) in requests.

You can also use the headers listed in the table below.

| Header | Description |
----- | -----
| `X-Amz-Meta-*` | Object user-defined metadata.<br/><br/>{{ objstorage-name }} transforms all headers starting with `X-Amz-Meta-` as follows: `X-Amz-Meta-foo-bar_baz` → `X-Amz-Meta-Foo-Bar_baz`.<br/><br/>Total user-defined header size must not exceed 2 KB. The size of user-defined data is determined as the length of the UTF-8 encoded string. The header names and their values are included when calculating the size. |
| `X-Amz-Storage-Class` | Object [storage class](../../../concepts/storage-class.md).<br/><br/>Possible values:<ul><li>`STANDARD`: Standard storage.</li><li>`COLD`, `STANDARD_IA`, or `NEARLINE`: Cold storage.</li>{% if audience != "internal" %}<li>`ICE` or `GLACIER`: Ice storage.</li>{% endif %}</ul>If the header isn't specified, the object is stored in the storage defined in the bucket settings. |
| `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` | <p>Type of [retention](../../../concepts/object-lock.md) put on the object (if the bucket is [versioned](../../../concepts/versioning.md) and object lock is enabled in it):</p><ul><li>`GOVERNANCE`: An object lock with a predefined retention period that can be managed.</li><li>`COMPLIANCE`: An object lock with a predefined retention period with strict compliance.</li></ul><p>On an object version, you can put only retention (the headers `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` and `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date`), only legal hold (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold`), or both at the same time. For more information about their combined use, see [{#T}](../../../concepts/object-lock.md#types).</p> |
| `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date` | Date and time until which the object is retained, specified in any format described in the [HTTP standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-date-time-formats). For example, `Mon, 12 Dec 2022 09:00:00 GMT`. Specified only together with the `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` header. |
| `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold` | <p>Type of [legal hold](../../../concepts/object-lock.md) put on the object (if the bucket is [versioned](../../../concepts/versioning.md) and object lock is enabled in it):</p><ul><li>`ON`: Enabled.</li><li>`OFF`: Disabled.</li></ul><p>On an object version, you can put only retention (the headers `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` and `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date`), only legal hold (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold`), or both at the same time. For more information about their combined use, see [{#T}](../../../concepts/object-lock.md#types).</p> |

By using the headers listed below, you can set the [ACL](../../../concepts/acl.md) for an object to be uploaded.

{% include [storage-acl-headers](../../../_includes_service/storage-acl-object-headers.md) %}
