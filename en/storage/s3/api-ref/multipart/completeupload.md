# completeUpload method

The request completes multipart upload.

When receiving the request, {{ objstorage-name }}:

- Combines the parts obtained during the upload in the order of their numbering to form a target object.
- Deletes the upload ID, which means that any subsequent requests with that ID will return the `NoSuchUpload` error.

When completing the upload, the client must provide the list of the parts it sent. Each part's description must contain the `ETag` which the client receives in response to each uploaded part. See [{#T}](uploadpart.md).

The operation may take several minutes, depending on the object size and the number of parts.

If the request failed, the client app must be ready to repeat the request.
