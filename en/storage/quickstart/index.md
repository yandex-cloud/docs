# Getting started with {{ objstorage-full-name }}

{{ yandex-cloud }} provides a universal scalable data storage solution known as {{ objstorage-full-name }}. The solution is equally suited for high-load services requiring reliable and fast access to data and for projects with moderate storage infrastructure requirements.

In {{ objstorage-name }} terms, files and folders are [objects](../concepts/object.md). All objects are stored in [buckets](../concepts/bucket.md). The service has a flat storage structure for bucket objects, but [GUI-based tools](../tools/index.md#file-browser) enable you to use {{ objstorage-name }} as a hierarchical file system.

The {{ objstorage-name }} API is partially compatible with the AWS S3 API, so you can use [tools](../tools/index.md) built for S3.

Get started with the service using the following interfaces:
* [Management console](../quickstart.md)
* [AWS CLI](quickstart-aws-cli.md)

For more information on {{ objstorage-name }} features, see the [concepts](../concepts/index.md).
