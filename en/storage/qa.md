#### How do you guarantee the performance of {{ objstorage-full-name }}? {#qa-timings}

{{ objstorage-name }} has internal SLAs and SLOs that guarantee a specific speed of sending data to the customer, which, among other things, depend on the storage class.

The {{ objstorage-name }} response time depends on multiple factors:

* Client-side performance (network speed, CPU load, or disk subsystem load).
* The speed of trunk connections, connections between data centers, or client-server connections.
* Performance of {{ objstorage-name }} itself.

This is why we can't specify a particular response time value. However, we do not consider a sharp increase in response time or a marked decrease in the speed of sending data to be the norm, and keep working to improve the technical characteristics of {{ objstorage-name }}.
