# Create a target group

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   To create a new [target group](../concepts/target-resources.md):

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you wish to create a target group.
   1. In the list of services, select **{{ network-load-balancer-name }}**.
   1. On the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/trgroups.svg) **Target groups**.
   1. Click **Create target group**.
   1. Enter the name of the target group.

      {% include [name-format](../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

   1. Select the VMs to add to the target group.
   1. Click **Create**.

- CLI

   If you don't have the {{ yandex-cloud }} command line interface, [install it](../../cli/quickstart.md#install).

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. See the description of the CLI's create target group command:

      ```
      yc load-balancer target-group create --help
      ```

   1. Get a list of VMs:

      ```
      yc compute instance list
      ```

      Result:

      ```
      +----------------------+------------+---------------+---------+
      |          ID          |    NAME    |    ZONE ID    | STATUS  |
      +----------------------+------------+---------------+---------+
      ...
      | fhmajnpl7cvhl6v1s12i | test-vm-1  | ru-central1-a | RUNNING |
      | fhmajv6f27n0a4a1sbml | test-vm-2  | ru-central1-a | RUNNING |
      ...
      +----------------------+------------+---------------+---------+
      ```

   1. Choose the `ID` of the VM to add to a target group and get information about it:

      ```
      yc compute instance get fhmajnpl7cvhl6v1s12i
      ```

      Result:

      ```
        ...
        subnet_id: e9bhjah6j3k7e6v8t5fa
        primary_v4_address:
          address: 192.168.0.3
        ...
      ```

   1. Create a target group and add the appropriate VM to it as a target by specifying the `subnet-id` and `address` of the VM in the `--target` flag:

      ```
      yc load-balancer target-group create \
        --region-id ru-central1 \
        --name test-tg-1 \
        --target subnet-id=<subnet ID>,address=<internal IP address of resource>
      ```



- API

   You can create a new target group using the [create](../api-ref/TargetGroup/create.md) API method.

   Once the target group has been created, add targets that the load will be distributed across. You can use the [addTargets](../api-ref/TargetGroup/addTargets) method to add targets to a group.

- Terraform

   If you don't have Terraform, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:

      * `name`: Target group name.
      * `target` section: Target resource description:
         * `subnet_id`: ID of the subnet to which target objects are connected. All targets in the target group must be connected to the same subnet within the same availability zone. Required parameter.
         * `address`: Resource internal IP address. Required parameter.

      ```hcl
      provider "yandex" {
        token     = "<OAuth>"
        cloud_id  = "<cloud ID>"
        folder_id = "<folder ID>"
        zone      = "ru-central1-a"
      }

      resource "yandex_lb_target_group" "foo" {
        name      = "my-target-group"

        target {
          subnet_id = "<subnet ID>"
          address   = "<internal IP address of resource>"
        }

        target {
          subnet_id = "<subnet ID>"
          address   = "<internal IP address of resource 2>"
        }

      }
      ```

      For more information about the `yandex_lb_target_group` parameters in Terraform, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/lb_target_group).

   1. Make sure that the configuration files are correct.

      1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run the check using the command:

         ```
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal displays a list of created resources and their parameters. If there are errors in the configuration, Terraform points them out.

   1. Deploy the cloud resources.

      1. If the configuration doesn't contain any errors, run the command:

         ```
         terraform apply
         ```

      1. Confirm the resource creation: type `yes` in the terminal and press **Enter**.

      Afterwards, all the necessary resources are created in the specified folder. You can check that the resources are there with the correct settings using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
