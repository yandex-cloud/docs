# Targets and groups

A network load balancer distributes the load across cloud resources that are combined into a *target group*.

A *target* is defined by two parameters: the subnet ID and the internal IP address of the resource. Targets within a single group must be located in the same cloud network. All targets must be connected to the same subnet within a single availability zone. The maximum number of resources in a target group is 254.

The targets must receive traffic on the same port as the one specified in the listener configuration.

## Attached target group {#attached-target-group}

An attached target group is a group of targets that is [attached](../operations/target-group-attach.md) to a network load balancer. You can attach a target group to multiple load balancers. However, you cannot attach a target group to ports with the same number on different load balancers. For example, if a group is attached to a load balancer on port 8080, you should attach it to another load balancer on port 8081.

Once a target group is attached, the load balancer will start performing target health checks and distributing the load across the targets in the group.

If a target group is used in at least one load balancer, you cannot delete it. First, you need to [delete](../operations/target-group-delete.md) it from all load balancers.
