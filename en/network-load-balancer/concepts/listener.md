# Listener

A *listener* is a virtual service responsible for receiving traffic via the specified IP, port, and data communication protocol. Ports ranging from 1 to 32767 can be used for receiving traffic. A single load balancer may have multiple listeners.

You can configure a listener when creating a new network load balancer or create a load balancer without a listener and add one later.
