# Listener

*A listener* is a virtual service responsible for receiving traffic via the specified IP, port, and data communication protocol. Ports ranging from 1 to 32767 can be used for receiving traffic. 

A listener is configured when creating a new network load balancer or can be added later. You can create a load balancer without any listener.
