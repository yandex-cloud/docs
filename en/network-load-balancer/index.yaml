        Yandex Network Load Balancer helps ensure applications' fault tolerance by evenly distributing loads across cloud resources. The service lets you create <a href="/docs/network-load-balancer/concepts/">network load balancers</a> and combine cloud resources into <a href="/docs/network-load-balancer/concepts/target-resources">target groups</a> across which traffic can be distributed. <a href="/docs/network-load-balancer/concepts/health-check">Health checks</a> regularly examine resources
        from the target group connected to the load balancer, ensuring that traffic is only sent to working resources.
      - Yandex Cloud infrastructure <a href="https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yc-compliance/conformance_ru_pdp.pdf">is fully secure</a> and in compliance with Russian Federal Law 152-FZ.
