      - Yandex Network Load Balancer is a service that helps ensure the fault tolerance of applications by evenly distributing network load across cloud resources. The service lets you create <a href="/docs/network-load-balancer/concepts/">network load balancers</a> and combine cloud resources into <a href="/docs/network-load-balancer/concepts/target-resources">target groups</a> that you can distribute traffic across. Target group resources that are attached to a load balancer are regularly polled through <a href="/docs/network-load-balancer/concepts/health-check">health checks</a>. This ensures traffic is only sent to healthy resources.
      - The Yandex Cloud infrastructure <a href="https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yc-compliance/conformance_ru_pdp.pdf">is protected</a> pursuant to Russian Federal Law 152-FZ "On personal data".
      - The service is subject to the <a href="https://yandex.com/legal/cloud_sla">Service Level Agreement</a>. The service level is defined in the <a href="https://yandex.com/legal/cloud_sla_loadbalancer">Service Level for Yandex Network Load Balancer</a>.
