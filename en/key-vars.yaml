            On your cluster, you’ll see the newly created “bookings” table with
            around 100k rows. The source CSV file is located
            [here](https://svobodnyi-bucket-dlya-vsego-mira.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/csv/bookings_alter.csv){target=_blank

              Arrears are the negative balance of the personal account that is
              formed when the billing threshold is enabled. If the arrears
              exceed the billing threshold, access to resources will be
              suspended. To avoid this, the arrears must be paid within the
              terms stipulated by the
              [agreement](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_oferta).
            md_context_threshold-help: >-
              A billing threshold enables you to spend over your personal
              account limit to a certain value. The threshold value is
              calculated specifically for each billing account and depends on
              various factors. When the billing threshold is reached, an attempt
              will be made to debit your card. If the attempt fails and the
              arrears continue growing, access to resources will be suspended.
              The billing threshold is valid for 1 month. [Learn more about the

            machines. You can create virtual machines from optimized images much
            faster than from conventional ones: this enables you to instantly
            expand your computing power and use tools from your own image on
            them. Standard images from the Marketplace are already optimized for

          **YDT** helps you quickly and safely migrate databases from other

          minimizes the downtime of applications that use it.

              Managed Service for Kubernetes release channels:


              **RAPID**: Contains the latest Kubernetes versions. Frequent
              updates with new features and improvements. You can't disable
              auto-updates.


              **REGULAR**: Contains different Kubernetes versions. Updates come
              in batches some time after they appear in the **RAPID** channel.
              You can disable auto-updates.


              **STABLE**: Contains stable Kubernetes versions. Only updates
              related to bug fixes or security improvements are applied. You can
              disable auto-updates.


              You can't change the channel after you create a Kubernetes
              cluster. For more information about channels, see the
              [documentation](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/managed-kubernetes/concepts/release-channels-and-updates).

            Currently, labels installed on node groups in this cluster using the
            Managed Kubernetes API may be mistakenly installed on nodes that
            aren't related to the corresponding group.


            We released a fix for the service, and there won't be any new
            errors.


            Invalid labels can be removed from cluster nodes via the Kubernetes
            API. You can use the kubectl utility to do this. We'll send detailed
            instructions on how to easily restore consistent label states.

            With routing tables, you can build routes between networks and other
            virtual or local networks. Or configure a fault-tolerant data
            transfer scheme with routes in multiple availability zones.

            YDB databases can be created in two modes: 

            Dedicated: When creating a database, the user should determine in
            advance what resources their database will consume in terms of
            compute resources (CPU and RAM) and storage resources. In this case,
            the user pays for the resources allocated to them.

            Serverless: The user doesn't determine the resources to be allocated
            for servicing their database. YDB automatically allocates and
            releases resources based on the user load, which is the amount of
            stored data and the number and complexity of operations performed
            with the data. In this case, the user is charged the cost of
            performing operations and the stored data.

              A document table contains sets of elements, and elements contain
              sets of attributes. An attribute is a fundamental data element
              that doesn't require further decomposition. When creating a
              document table, you must specify a primary key that serves as a
              unique ID for table elements. Except for the primary key, a
              document table may contain no schema. Each element may have its
              own set of attributes. 
            label_info-table-type_ydb: >-
              A YDB table always has one or more columns that make up a primary
              key. Table rows are unique by key, meaning there can only be one
              row for a single key value. YDB tables are always ordered by key.
              This means that point reads by key and range-based queries by key
              are performed efficiently (actually using an index). The sequence
              of columns in a key matters. Tables only consisting of key columns
              are allowed. You can't create tables without a primary key.

              certain period of time (uses a lot of CPU time)
            tooltip_autopartition-by-size: >-
              A table shard is split into two when the specified data size is

            tooltip_explicit-partitions: Shard boundary keys during initial partitioning
            tooltip_index-key: >-
              A table may have multiple secondary indexes, and an index may
              include multiple columns. The sequence of columns in an index
              matters. A single column may consist of multiple indexes and even
              be part of a primary key and a secondary index at the same time.
            tooltip_key-bloom-filter: In some cases, it can speed up key reads
            tooltip_partitions-type: >-
              Evenly: For Uint32 and Uint64 key columns, it splits the entire
              range from 0 to the maximum value of the type into intervals of
              the same length. It's well suited for even distribution of data
              across shards when an evenly distributed hash function is used as
              key values.

              Explicitly: Lets you set shard boundary keys for initial
              partitioning.
            tooltip_pk: Primary key
            tooltip_primary-key: >-
              A YDB table always has one or more columns that make up a primary
              key. Table rows are unique by key, meaning there can only be one
              row for a single key value. YDB tables are always ordered by key.
              The sequence of columns in a key matters. Tables only consisting
              of key columns are allowed. You can't create tables without a
              primary key.
            tooltip_section-autopartition: >-

              merge them when the size or load decreases
            tooltip_section-ttl: Automatically delete expired rows from a table.
            tooltip_shard: >-
              A partition key is a simple primary key that consists of a single
              attribute. YDB uses the partition key value as input for the
              internal hashing function. The result of calculating the hash
              function determines the partition where the element will be
              stored.
            tooltip_sort: >-
              A primary key can be composite and consist of a partition key and
              a sort key.


              A partition key is a simple primary key that consists of a single
              attribute. YDB uses the partition key value as input for the
              internal hashing function. The result of calculating the hash
              function determines the partition where the element will be
              stored. All elements with the same partition key will be stored
              together, sorted by the value of the sort key.


              If a partition key and a sort key are specified in a document
              table, two elements may contain the same value for the partition
              key, but must contain different values for the sort key.
            tooltip_ttl-column: Date, Datetime, Timestamp, Uint32, Uint64 columns are supported.
            tooltip_ttl-lifetime: >-
              The row will be considered as expired at the moment of time, when
              the value stored in column is less than or equal to the current
              time, and lifetime has passed.
            tooltip_ttl-unit: >-

              epoch with a given unit.

          calculation-history: >-
            On an interval, each bar displays the historical status in which the
            alert was calculated.

            Clicking in the column starts the recalculation of the alert again.
            The results of this recalculation can be seen in the Computed Values
            section.

            The recalculation uses current program settings and the data that is
            in storage right now.

            If data or program settings have been changed since the historical
            calculation of the alert, the statuses in the "History of the alert
            calculation" and "Computed values" sections may differ.
          evaluation-status: Статус, который был получен в текущем перерасчете алерта.
          evaluation-type: >-
            The aggregation function applied to the metric values in the time
            window. When calculating function values, metric values are used
            without thinning.
          evaluation-window: >-
            Time window which will be used to evaluate the alert.

            Configured in alert settings.

          group-by-labels: >-
            Labels by which sub-alerts are generated. For each label value (or
            for all possible combinations thereof, if grouping by several labels
            is specified), its own sub-alert is independently created.
          no-data: >-
            Policies determine what status the alert will go to if there is no
            data (no points in the time window or no metrics for a given
            selector). Policies are applied before the conditions in "Threshold"
            alert or program in "Expression" alert.

            Escalations are triggered only for status ALARM.
          repeat: >-

            state.
          scalars: >-
            Display variables from the alert program that result in a single

              Communities are a great way to collaborate and use datasets,
              Docker images, and other DataSphere resources. Just share
              resources in your community, and everyone in it will get access.
              Since members can see all the projects in your community, sharing
              your work is easier than ever.

                offer.


                1. Create a project.

                2. Link a billing account to the community.

                3. If necessary, invite colleagues to the community.

                4. Create resources: secrets securely store keys and passwords,
                while S3 connectors and datasets let you access source data.

                5. Open the IDE and get started.

                That's it! Launch training, share resources, and share your
                results with community members.

              Our updated tools are everything you need to deploy and run
              services. Use aliases to combine working nodes into clusters and
              distribute loads between them. Once your aliases are in place, you
              can update and flexibly scale services on the fly. You'll find
              everything you need to know about creating aliases in the
              documentation.

                1. Create a project.

                2. Link a billing account to the community.

                3. If necessary, invite colleagues to the community.

                4. Create resources: secrets securely store keys and passwords,
                while S3 connections and datasets let you access source data.

                5. Open the IDE and get started.

                That's it! Launch training, share resources, and share your
                results with community members.
