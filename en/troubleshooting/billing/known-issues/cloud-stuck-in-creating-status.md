## Issue description {#issue-description}

The cloud got stuck in the `CREATING` status or it takes too long to create a cloud.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

The cloud you are creating may not be linked to any billing account. To complete the operation, you need to [link](../../../billing/operations/pin-cloud.md) the existing or a [new billing account](../../../billing/operations/create-new-account.md) to the cloud.

After that, you will be able to create resources in the cloud again.
