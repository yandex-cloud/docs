You need to find out when and why user files and clouds are deleted and how long they are stored.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

According to clause 11.5.1 of the [offer agreement](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_oferta/), Yandex ensures the storage of information and Content of the Customer, placed on the Platform's resources:

* For Business accounts: within 60 (sixty) calendar days from the date of suspension of the Customer's access to the Services for reasons related to the Customer's non-compliance with the terms of payment for the Services, or from the date of the Trial period end.
* For Personal accounts: within 30 (thirty) calendar days from the date of suspension of the Customer's access to the Services for reasons related to the Customer's non-compliance with the terms of payment for the Services, or from the date of the Trial period end.
* Within 7 (seven) calendar days from the date of suspension of the Customer's access to the Services for reasons related to the Customer's non-compliance with other terms of the Agreement.

After the expiration of the above terms, in case the Customer fails to eliminate the violations that led to the suspension of access to the Services, Yandex has the right to label the information and Content, placed on the Platform resources, as deletable and delete them along with the Platform resources within **72 hours**.
