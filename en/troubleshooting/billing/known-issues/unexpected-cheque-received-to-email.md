# Unexpected receipt for an amount missing from the payment history arrived at the email linked to the billing account



## Issue description {#issue-description}

* You got an electronic receipt at the email linked to the billing account. However, there is no record of debiting the specified amount in the payment history.
* The electronic receipt received by email has the _Pay-in_ type.
* The electronic receipt received by email has the _credit transfer_ or _full settlement_ payment method.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

{{ yandex-cloud }} uses the postpaid model: first, you enjoy our resources and then, you pay for actual usage.

The document you received is a receipt for actual usage, which is similar to a reconciliation [report](../../../billing/concepts/act.md) businesses exchange for a reporting period. It confirms that you used a certain amount of services; it does not mean the debiting of funds.
