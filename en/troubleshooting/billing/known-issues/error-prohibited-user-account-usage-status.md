# Resolving the `PROHIBITED_BILLING_ACCOUNT_USAGE_STATUS` error


## Issue description {#issue-description}

When trying to link a cloud to a billing account, you get this error: `PROHIBITED_BILLING_ACCOUNT_USAGE_STATUS`.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

This error occurs because you cannot reassign a cloud from a billing account arranged for paid consumption to an account that is in a trial period. Upgrade to the paid version as per [this guide](../../../getting-started/free-trial/concepts/upgrade-to-paid.md) first and try linking the desired cloud once again.
