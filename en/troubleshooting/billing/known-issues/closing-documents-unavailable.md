# Closing documents are unavailable in the console



## Issue description {#issue-description}

You cannot download reporting documents on the [billing account management page]({{ link-console-billing }}) under **Reporting documents**

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

Downloading of reporting documents will be available on the billing account management page only after the reporting period is closed. Typically, this is 5-7 business days following the reporting period (from the 1st to the 30th or the 1st to the 31st of the month).

You can also pay for {{ yandex-cloud }} services by generating a payment invoice.
The invoice is sent to the contact email address linked to the account of your billing account owner.

## If the issue persists {#if-issue-still-persists}

If you could not download the reporting documents 5-7 days after the beginning of the next billing period, [create a request for technical support](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/support?section=contact).
When creating the request, provide the following information:

1. The ID of the billing account for which you need closing documents.
You can find it on the [page with your billing account details]({{ link-console-billing }}).
2. Problem description.
