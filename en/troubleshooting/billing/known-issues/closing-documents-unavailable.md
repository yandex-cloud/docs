# Closing documents are not available in the console



## Issue description {#issue-description}

You cannot download reporting documents on the [billing account management page]({{ link-console-billing }}) under **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.switch_acts }}**.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

You can only download reporting documents on the billing account management page after the reporting period is closed. Usually, it takes 5 to 7 business days following the reporting period (from the 1st to the 30th or 31st of the month).

You can also pay for {{ yandex-cloud }} services by generating a payment invoice. You can get the invoice to the email address linked to the account of your billing account owner.
