# Payment deadline



## Scenario description {#case-description}

You need to find out the date for topping up the balance of your billing account.

## Solution {#case-resolution}


Yandex Cloud uses a postpaid billing system.

The amount to be paid is proportional of your usage of Yandex Cloud resources in the reporting period.
The payment itself (topping up the balance of your billing account) is expected by Yandex Cloud **within two weeks from the start of the new reporting period (month)**.

For a more detailed payment cycle description, see these documentation sections:

* [Payment cycle for legal entities](../../../billing/payment/billing-cycle-business.md)
* [Payment cycle for individuals](../../../billing/payment/billing-cycle-individual.md).
