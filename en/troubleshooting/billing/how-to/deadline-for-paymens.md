# Payment deadline



## Case description {#case-description}

You need to find out the deadline for topping up your billing account.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

{{ yandex-cloud }} uses the postpaid billing model. 

The amount due is based on the volume of resources consumed during the reporting period. {{ yandex-cloud }} expects your payment, i.e., you topping up your billing account, within two weeks from the start of the new reporting period, i.e., month.
