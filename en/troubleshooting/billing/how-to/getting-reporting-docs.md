# How to get closing documents



## Case description {#case-description}

You need to obtain closing documents, such as a service provision report, account statement, or invoice, for the most recent reporting period.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

The original copies of the closing documents are automatically sent by Russian Post to the legal address of the organization, as well as to the email of the billing account owner, on the 5th to 7th business day following the reporting period (from the 1st to the 30th or 31st day of the month).

You can specify both your postal and email addresses [in the {{ yandex-cloud }} payer account in Yandex Balance](https://balance.yandex.com).

You can also download the closing documents from the [{{ billing-name }}](../../../billing/operations/download-reporting-docs.md) after 5-7 days from the beginning of the next reporting period.


## If nothing helped {#if-nothing-worked}

If the reporting documents for the previous reporting period do not arrive by email within 5-7 days after the beginning of the next reporting period, [create a support ticket]({{ link-console-support }}). Provide the following information in your ticket:

1. Billing account ID. You can find this ID on the [page with the billing account details]({{ link-console-billing }}).
1. List of the reporting documents you would like to receive.
