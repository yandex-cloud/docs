# How to change the format and data in the issued payment invoices



## Case description {#case-description}

You need to edit the layout or format of the invoice issued for the {{ yandex-cloud }} services you consumed.


## Solution {#case-resolution}

We cannot customize the invoices we issue, since we create them automatically based on a predefined template and send to your email. There is no create or due date in the invoice, since it contains information on the entire amount due at the time of its issue.

You can pay the issued invoice at any convenient time within the payment period.

The cost of services is determined using the accounting methods based on the service report and the invoice. Currently, there are no laws or regulations stating that creating a payment invoice is mandatory when settling with counterparties.

According to clause 6.10 of the [Offer to conclude an agreement on the use of the Yandex Cloud services]({{ billing-oferta-url }}) that the client accepts when creating a billing account, the client makes a payment without any invoice issued by Yandex.

This means that you can issue payment without an automatically generated payment invoice. You can pay for services both under the Agreement and the Report of provided services. The Report also has a breakdown with all the details of the billing account, which you can also use for payment. Just make sure to correctly specify the recipient's details and the billing account in the payment details.

After that, send your payment order on behalf of the legal entity that shows up in your billing account.

If you follow these requirements, the payment will be automatically credited to the billing account balance.

## If nothing helped {#if-nothing-worked}

If you cannot find the payment details for your invoice, you can [create a support ticket]({{ link-console-support }}). Provide the following information in your ticket:

1. Billing account ID. You can find this ID on the [page with the billing account details]({{ link-console-billing }}).
1. List of documents required to make a payment.
