# How to restore access to a billing account created via simplified registration in Yandex ID



## Issue description {#case-description}

You need to gain access to a billing account that was created using [simplified registration in Yandex ID](https://yandex.ru/support/id/authorization/lite.html#lite__login-mail), but access to the account created in such a way in Yandex ID was lost.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

Try to restore access to your Yandex ID account by going to the [account recovery page](https://passport.yandex.ru/auth/restore/login).
After that, you can go to Yandex Cloud and edit your billing account.

## If nothing helped {#if-issue-still-persists}

If you cannot find or recover the account to which the card is linked, and undesirable actions (for example, withdrawals from the billing account) continue, as a last resort, you can reissue your bank card. This will stop all withdrawals because your current payment details will be invalidated.

You can also [create a new request for technical support](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/support?section=contact).
When creating the request, be sure to specify:

1. Billing account ID.
You can find this ID on the [page with billing account details]({{ link-console-support }}).
2. The email address used for simplified registration in Yandex ID.
   We will use this email to find the details of the billing accounts linked to your account.
3. A description of the actions you want to perform with the billing account, in arbitrary format.
