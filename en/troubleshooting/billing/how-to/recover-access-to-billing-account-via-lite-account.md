# How to restore access to a billing account created through the Yandex ID simplified sign-up



## Case description {#case-description}

You need to regain access to a billing account that was created using [Yandex ID simplified sign-up](https://yandex.com/support/id/en/authorization/lite.html#lite__login-mail), if such access has been lost.


## Solution {#case-resolution}

Try restoring access to your Yandex ID account by going to the [account recovery page](https://passport.yandex.com/auth/restore/login).


Once the access is restored, you can go to {{ yandex-cloud }} and manage your billing account as needed.

## If nothing helped {#if-nothing-worked}

If you cannot find or restore the Yandex ID where you added your credit/debit card, while unwanted transactions, such as debits from the billing account, continue, as a last resort, you can ask your bank to reissue the card. This will stop all debits, since your current payment details will become invalid.

You can also [create a support ticket]({{ link-console-support }}). Provide the following information in your ticket:

1. Billing account ID: You can find this ID on the [page with the billing account details]({{ link-console-billing }}).
1. Email address used for Yandex ID simplified sign-up. We will use it to find the details of the billing accounts linked to your Yandex ID.
1. The actions you want to perform with the billing account.
