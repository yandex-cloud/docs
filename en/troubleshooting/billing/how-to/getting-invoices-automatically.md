# How to receive invoices to your email automatically



## Case description {#case-description}

You need to receive invoices to your email automatically.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

We will automatically generate and send your payment invoice at the beginning of the following reporting period, provided the following conditions are met:

* You pay via [**wire transfer**](../../../billing/payment/payment-methods-business.md).
* [Total invoice amount](../../../billing/concepts/bill.md#payment-amount) is greater than zero.

## If the issue persists {#if-nothing-worked}

If you still do not receive invoices at the email address linked to the billing account owner's account, [create a support ticket]({{ link-console-support }}). Provide the following information in your ticket:

1. ID of the billing account for which you were unable to get an invoice. You can find it on the [page with your billing account details]({{ link-console-billing }}).
1. Email address to which you expect the invoice to be delivered.
1. Issue description.
