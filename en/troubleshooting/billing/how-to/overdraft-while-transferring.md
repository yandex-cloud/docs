# Negative balance limit for wire transfers



## Case description {#case-description}

You need to find out if there is a negative balance limit for wire transfers.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

When paying via wire transfer, no negative balance limit is set. Services are suspended only if the outstanding amounts [have not been paid within the terms specified in the agreement]({{ billing-oferta-url }}):

> 6.9. The Customer pays the Arrears arising as a result of consuming Services during the Reporting period, monthly within 14 (fourteen) calendar days from the end of the applicable Reporting period (excluding non-working holidays), unless a different payment procedure for individual Services is provided by Special terms. When calculating the Arrears, Grants provided to the Client are taken into account.

This means that if you choose **Wire transfer** as the payment type, services will be suspended only if both conditions are met: 

1. At the end of the previous month, your account balance was negative.
1. You have failed to pay the arrears within the first 14 days of the current month.
