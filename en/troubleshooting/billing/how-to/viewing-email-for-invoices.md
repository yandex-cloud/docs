# How to find out which email receives payment invoices



## Case description {#case-description}

You need to determine which email address gets the invoices.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

The billing account owner can check the destination of invoices in the [management console](https://console.yandex.cloud/settings).

All invoices are sent solely to the email address specified there. You cannot add another email address, but you can set up email forwarding to a different address in your inbox. To learn more, see [this Yandex Mail help guide](https://yandex.com/support/yandex-360/customers/mail/en/web/preferences/filters/forwarding.html).

## If the issue persists {#if-nothing-worked}

If the invoice still does not arrive at the email address linked to the account of the billing account owner, [create a support ticket]({{ link-console-support }}). Provide the following information in your ticket:

1. The ID of the billing account for which you were unable to get an invoice.  You can find it on the [page with your billing account details]({{ link-console-billing }}).
1. The email address to which you expect the invoice to be delivered.
1. Issue description.
