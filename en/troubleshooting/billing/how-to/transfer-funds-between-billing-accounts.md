# How to transfer funds between billing accounts



## Case description {#case-description}

You need to transfer funds from one billing account to another.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

You cannot transfer funds between billing accounts; however, we can arrange a refund for you so you can top up the balance of the other billing account.

You will need to [create a support ticket]({{ link-console-support }}) for us to issue a refund to you. Provide the following information in your ticket:

1. ID of the billing account for which you are requesting a refund. You can find this ID on the [page with the billing account details]({{ link-console-billing }}).
1. Amount to refund.

{% note warning %}

The refund amount cannot exceed your current account balance.
