# Resolving issues with access to the podcast statistics dashboard in Yandex Music



## Issue description {#issue-description}

* You lost access to the podcast statistics dashboard in {{ datalens-name }}.
* One or more podcasts fail to show up on the podcast statistics dashboard in {{ datalens-name }}. 

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

{{ datalens-full-name }} updates statistics once a day, so the dashboard charts may occasionally display data mismatching Yandex Music statistics.

Wait for a while, and then check the data on the dashboard charts again. This usually takes between one and twenty-four hours.
