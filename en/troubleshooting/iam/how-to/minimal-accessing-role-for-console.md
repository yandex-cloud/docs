# What minimum role a user requires to access the YC management console


## Case description {#case-description}

You need to assign the minimum role for accessing the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) to a user.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

The `{{ roles-cloud-member }}` role will do. This role alone does not provide you with any permissions to perform any operations and is only used in combination with other roles.
