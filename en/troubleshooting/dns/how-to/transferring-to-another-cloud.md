You can transfer {{ dns-name }} on your own. To do this, you can export DNS zones to a {{ TF }} manifest file and then deploy them in another cloud or folder using the YC CLI. Check out our example of the export command in [this article](../../../cli/cli-ref/dns/cli-ref/bind-file/migrate-to-terraform).
