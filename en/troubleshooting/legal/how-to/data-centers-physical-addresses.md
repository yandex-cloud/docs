# Determine the physical (geographical) address of the Yandex Cloud Data Center



## Scenario description {#case-description}

You need to know the exact addresses of the servers located in the Yandex Cloud data processing centers, to include them in the notification documents prepared in connection with the requirements of regulatory authorities.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

The Yandex Cloud platform is hosted in three Yandex data centers located in Vladimir, Ryazan, and Moscow regions.

Resources in Yandex Cloud are divided into zonal (linked to an availability zone) and global (not linked to a zone).
For instance, a VM instance and disk are zonal resources.

Here are the addresses of our data centers:

* In Mytishchi city: Ul. Silikatnaya 19
* In Vladimir region: Vladimir, Ul. Energetikov 37 bld. 2
* In Ryazan region: Sasovo, Ul. Pushkina 21

We recommend specifying all the three addresses. The practice of other clients shows that this approach does not cause objections from the regulator.
