# Does a user have to conclude a separate agreement to comply with the requirements of the Russian Federal Law No. 152-FZ on Personal Data?



## Case description {#case-description}

You need to figure out if you have to conclude a separate agreement when placing user personal data, i.e., full name, email address, phone number, in {{ yandex-cloud }} to comply with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 152-FZ.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

No additional agreement is needed. When a client, acting as an operator, places personal data on {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, the client entrusts Yandex to process this data. {{ yandex-cloud }} undertakes to respect the confidentiality of personal data and ensure the security of personal data while processing it, as well as meet all legal requirements for protecting the processed personal data.
