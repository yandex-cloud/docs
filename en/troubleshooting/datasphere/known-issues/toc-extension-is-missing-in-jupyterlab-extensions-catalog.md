# `Table of Contents` extension is missing from the {{ jlab }}Lab extension list


## Issue description {#issue-description}

The {{ jlab }}Lab extension folder of your {{ ml-platform-name }} project running in serverless mode does not contain the `Table of Contents` extension. This extension facilitates navigation inside the project files using headers.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

If you use {{ ml-platform-name }} in serverless mode, {{ jlab }}Lab 3.0 and higher is not available yet. Opt for the [dedicated mode](../../../datasphere/concepts/project.md#dedicated) that supports {{ jlab }}Lab 3.5.3.

Check new {{ ml-platform-name }} releases on the [release notes](../../../datasphere/release-notes.md) page.
