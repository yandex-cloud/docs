# How to increase the number of network connections


## Case description {#case-description}

You need to raise the network connection limit per VM to 100,000 or higher.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

If you need more connections, you can create multiple VMs and set up a [network load balancer](../../../network-load-balancer/quickstart.md).

You can also [contact support]({{ link-console-support }}) so that our team raises that limit for you.
