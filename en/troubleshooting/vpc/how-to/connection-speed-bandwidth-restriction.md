# Checking for traffic, connection speed, and bandwidth limitations



## Case description {#case-description}

You need to know whether {{ vpc-name }} limits traffic, connection speed, or bandwidth.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

{{ vpc-name }} does not limit the bandwidth, traffic, or connection speed. You can only encounter limitations on channels beyond our scope of responsibility. 

We charge you only for outgoing traffic exceeding 100 GB per month. You can check our prices [here](../../../vpc/pricing.md).
