# Checking for restrictions on traffic, connection speed, and bandwidth



## Scenario description {#case-description}

You need to find out if the {{ vpc-full-name }} traffic, Internet connection speed, or bandwidth is limited.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

{{ vpc-full-name }} does not limit the bandwidth, traffic, and connection speed. Users might only encounter limitations on channels outside our scope of responsibility.

We only charge for outbound traffic exceeding 100 GB/month. You can check the prices [here](../../../vpc/pricing).
