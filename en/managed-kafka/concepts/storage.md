# Storage types

{% if audience != "internal" %}

{{ mkf-name }} allows you to use network and local storage for clusters. Network storage is based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. Local storage is organized on disks that are physically located on [broker servers](brokers.md).

## Local storage features {#local-storage-features}

Local storage doesn't provide fault tolerance for a single-host cluster: if a local disk fails, the data is permanently lost. To ensure fault tolerance, create clusters of three or more hosts.

## Non-replicated network storage features {#network-nrd-storage-features}

{% include [nrd-storage-details](../../_includes/mdb/nrd-storage-details.md) %}
