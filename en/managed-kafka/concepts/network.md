# Network in {{ mkf-name }}


When creating a cluster, you can:

* Set the network for cluster hosts.
* Specify the availability zones where the cluster hosts should reside.
* Set subnets in all availability zones.
* Turn on public access to the cluster from outside {{ yandex-cloud }}.

If hosts are present in the {{ ZK }} cluster, each of the three {{ ZK }} hosts uses its dedicated availability zone and the subnet selected in it. For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/index.md).


## Hostname and FQDN {#hostname}

{{ mkf-short-name }} generates the name of each cluster host during creation. This name will be the host's fully qualified domain name (FQDN). The hostname and, consequently, the FQDN cannot be changed.


You can use the FQDN to access the host within a single cloud network. Read more in the [{{ vpc-full-name }} documentation](../../vpc/).

## Public access to clusters {#public-access-to-a-cluster}

All [broker hosts](brokers.md) in the cluster are available from outside {{ yandex-cloud }} if you request public access when [creating a cluster](../operations/cluster-create.md). To connect to such a cluster, use the FQDN of one or more of the cluster's broker hosts.

You can't request public access after creating a cluster.

When you delete a cluster with public access enabled, all public IP addresses assigned to this cluster are revoked.

## Security groups {#security-groups}

{% note info %}

{% include [security-groups-note](../../_includes/vpc/security-groups-note-services.md) %}

{% endnote %}

{% include [sg-rules-limits](../../_includes/mdb/sg-rules-limits.md) %}

{% note tip %}

When connecting to a cluster from within its cloud network, make sure to [configure](../operations/connect.md#configuring-security-groups) security groups both for the cluster and for the connecting host.

{% endnote %}

Specifics of working with security groups:

* Security group settings only affect the capacity to connect to the cluster. They do not affect cluster operation: replication of topic sections by broker hosts, connections between brokers and {{ ZK }} hosts, and other features.

* Even if the cluster and the connecting host are in the same security group, the connection won't be possible unless rules that allow traffic between the host and cluster are set up in this group.

   However, by default, those rules are contained in the security group that is added automatically when creating a cloud network. Those are the `Self` rules that allow unlimited traffic within a group.

For more information, see the [{{ vpc-name }} documentation](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md).
