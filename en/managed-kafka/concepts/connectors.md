# Connectors

Connectors are {{ KFC }} components [built into {{ mkf-name }}](#supported) for streaming data between {{ KF }} and other data systems. You can use a connector for continuous data migration to and from {{ mkf-name }} clusters. Data in connectors is handled through separate {{ KFC }} *worker threads*. Learn more about {{ KFC }} in [this {{ KF }} guide](https://kafka.apache.org/42/kafka-connect/overview/).

Connectors perform the following functions:

* Connecting to {{ mkf-name }} clusters and other data stores.
* Reading and writing data.
* Managing data streaming.

For any type of connector, you can specify:

* Task limit that determines the number of workers running concurrently.
* Additional properties.

For a step-by-step guide on using connectors, see [{#T}](../operations/cluster-connector.md).

## Supported connectors {#supported-connectors}

### MirrorMaker {#mirrormaker}

{% note info %}

{{ mkf-name }} supports **MirrorMaker** version 2.

{% endnote %}

**MirrorMaker** is used for replicating {{ KF }} topics between clusters.

A worker accesses the broker hosts of a {{ mkf-name }} cluster and replicates the topics specified in the connector filtering template. Depending on the connector's replication factor, it connects to one or more brokers.

Topic names in the target cluster cluster match those in the source cluster.

For more information about how MirrorMaker transfers data, see the [{{ KF }} documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/42/operations/geo-replication-cross-cluster-data-mirroring/).

### S3 Sink {#s3-sink}

The **S3 Sink** connector is only used as a target for data export from {{ KF }} topics to S3 storage.

The connector requests data from {{ KF }} on a regular basis and uploads it to S3 storage. The data is split into chunks, which are S3 file objects. The size of each data chunk depends on the specified maximum number of records it contains.

For more on how S3 Sink transfers data, see the [connector's guide](https://github.com/aiven/s3-connector-for-apache-kafka).
