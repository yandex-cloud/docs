# Access management in {{ mkf-name }}

{% if audience != "internal"%}

In this section, you will learn:

* [Which resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

## Which resources you can assign roles to {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

To allow access to {{ mkf-name }} service resources (clusters and hosts, cluster backups, partitions and topics, and users), assign the user the appropriate roles for the folder or cloud hosting the resources.

## Which roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

The chart below shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. For example, the `{{ roles-editor }}` role includes all the permissions of `{{ roles-viewer }}`. You can find the description of each role under the chart.

## Roles required {#required-roles}

To use the service, you need the `{{ roles.mkf.editor }}` [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) or higher to the folder where a cluster is created. The `{{ roles.mkf.viewer }}` role only enables you to view the cluster list.

You can always assign a role with more permissions. For example, assign `{{ roles.mkf.admin }}` instead of `{{ roles.mkf.editor` }}.
