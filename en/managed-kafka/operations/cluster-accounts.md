# Managing Apache KafkaÂ® accounts

Accounts in {{ KF }} let you manage permissions of data [producers and consumers](../concepts/producers-consumers.md). A producer or consumer can only access the [topics](../concepts/topics.md) that are allowed for their accounts.

You can use the same account for multiple producers or consumers: the former get the rights to write data to certain topics and the latter get the read rights.

After [creating a {{ KF }} cluster](cluster-create.md), you can:

- [Create an account](#create-account).
- [Update the account password](#update-password).
- [Update account settings](#update-account).
- [Grant account permissions](#grant-permission).
- [Revoke account permissions](#revoke-permission).
- [Delete an account](#delete-account).
- [Get a list of cluster accounts](#list-accounts).

## Create an account {#create-account}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  To create an account in a cluster:
  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mkf-name }}**.
  1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and select the tab **Users**.
  1. Click **Add**.
  1. Enter a name for the account (username) and password (from 8 to 128 characters).
  1. [Grant permissions](#grant-permission) to the necessary topics.
  1. Click **Add**.

{% if api != "noshow" %}

- API

  Use the [create](../api-ref/User/create.md) API method and pass the following in the request:
  - The cluster ID in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
  - Account settings in the `userSpec` parameter:
    - A name for the account in the `name` parameter.
    - A password for the account in the `password` parameter.
    - Topic permissions (one or more `permissions` parameters, one for each topic):
      - The topic name in the `topicName` parameter. To find out the name, [get a list of topics in the cluster](cluster-topics.md#list-topics).
      - Topic permissions in the `role` parameter: `ACCESS_ROLE_PRODUCER` for the producer or `ACCESS_ROLE_CONSUMER` for the consumer.

{% endif %}

  1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and select the tab **Users**.
  1. Click ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) for the desired account and select **Configure**.
  1. [Grant](#grant-permission) or [revoke](#revoke-permission) permissions to topics, if necessary.
  1. Click **Save**.

{% if api != "noshow" %}

- API

  Use the [update](../api-ref/User/update.md) API method and pass the following in the request:
  - The cluster ID in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
  - The account name in the `userName` parameter. To find out the name, [get a list of accounts in the cluster](#list-accounts).
  - A new set of permissions to topics (one or more `permissions` parameters, one for each topic).
  - In the `updateMask` parameter, a list of permissions to update (in a single line, separated by commas). If this parameter is omitted, the API method removes any permissions that aren't explicitly specified in the `topicSpec` parameter.

{% endif %}

{% endlist %}

## Grant account permissions {#grant-permission}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  When [creating](#create-account) or [updating](#update-account) an account, you can grant permissions to the necessary topics.

  To grant permissions to a topic:

  1. Find the desired topic in the list of topics.

     If the topic isn't in the list, add it:
     1. Click **+ Add topic**. If there is no such button, it means that all existing cluster topics are added to this account.
     1. Select the desired topic from the drop-down list.

  1. Click ![image](../../_assets/plus.svg) in the **Roles** column for the topic and select
     - `ACCESS_ROLE_CONSUMER`: Consumers who use this account will be granted access to the topic.
     - `ACCESS_ROLE_PRODUCER`: Producers who use this account will be granted access to the topic.

     You can select both roles at the same time. In this case, the account can be used by both producers and consumers.

  1. To grant permissions to other topics, repeat the steps.

  1. If you granted permissions to a topic by mistake, [revoke them](#revoke-permission).

{% if api != "noshow" %}

- API

  Use the [grantPermission](../api-ref/User/grantPermission.md) API method and pass the following in the request:
  - The cluster ID in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
  - The account name in the `userName` parameter. To find out the name, [get a list of accounts in the cluster](#list-accounts).

- Management console

  When [creating](#create-account) or [updating](#update-account) an account, you can revoke topic permissions.

  To revoke topic permissions:
  1. Find the desired topic in the list of topics.
  1. Delete the role that you no longer need by clicking ![image](../../_assets/cross.svg) next to the role name.
  1. To revoke all permissions to a topic, delete it from the list: hover over the topic name and click ![image](../../_assets/cross.svg) at the end of the line.

{% if api != "noshow" %}

- API

  Use the [revokePermission](../api-ref/User/revokePermission.md) API method and pass the following in the request:

  1. Confirm deletion and click **Delete**.

{% if api != "noshow" %}

- API
