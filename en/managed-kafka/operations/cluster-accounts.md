# Managing Apache KafkaÂ® accounts

Accounts in {{ KF }} let you manage permissions of data [producers and consumers](../concepts/producers-consumers.md). A producer or consumer can only access the [topics](../concepts/topics.md) that are allowed for their accounts.

You can use the same account for multiple producers or consumers: the former get the rights to write data to certain topics and the latter get the read rights.

After [creating a {{ KF }} cluster](cluster-create.md), you can:

- [{#T}](#create-account).
- [{#T}](#update-password).
- [{#T}](#update-account).
- [{#T}](#grant-permission).
- [{#T}](#revoke-permission).
- [{#T}](#delete-account).
- [{#T}](#list-accounts).

## Granting permissions to an account {#grant-permission}

{% include [mkf-deleted-topic-permissions-note](../../_includes/mdb/mkf-deleted-topic-permissions-note.md) %}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  When [creating](#create-account) or [updating](#update-account) an account, you can grant permissions to the necessary topics.

  To grant permissions to a topic:

  1. Find the desired topic in the list of topics.

     If the topic isn't in the list, add it:
     1. Click **+ Add topic**. If there is no such button, it means that all existing cluster topics are added to this account.
     1. Select the desired topic from the drop-down list.

  1. Click the ![image](../../_assets/plus.svg) in the **Roles** column for the topic and select:
     - `ACCESS_ROLE_CONSUMER`: Consumers who use this account will be granted access to the topic.
     - `ACCESS_ROLE_PRODUCER`: Producers who use this account will be granted access to the topic.

     You can select both roles at the same time. In this case, the account can be used by both producers and consumers.

  1. To grant permissions to other topics, repeat the steps.

  1. (optional) If you granted permissions to a topic by mistake, [revoke them](#revoke-permission).

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  To grant permissions to an account:

  1. Retrieve a list of cluster topics:

     ```
     {{ yc-mdb-kf }} topic list --cluster-name <cluster name>
     ```

  1. Grant permissions to the required topics by passing the `--permission` parameters:

     ```
     {{ yc-mdb-kf }} user update <username> \
     --cluster-name <cluster name>
     --permission topic=<topic name>,role=<user role: producer or consumer>
     ```

     The following `--permission` parameters are available:
     - **`topic`**: The name of the topic that the permissions are granted for.
     - **`role`**: User role, such as producer or consumer.

     When you update account permissions, the existing permissions are revoked and replaced with the new ones. That is, the command must always include a complete list of permissions to be assigned to the account.

     For example, to grant the `test-user` the permissions in the `kafka-cli` cluster for `topic2` with the `producer` role, but keep the existing permissions for `topic1`, run the command:

     ```
     {{ yc-mdb-kf }} user update test-user \
     --cluster-name kafka-cli \
     --permission topic=topic1,role=consumer \
     --permission topic=topic2,role=producer
     ```

- Terraform

    To grant permissions to an account:

    1. Open the current {{ TF }} configuration file with an infrastructure plan.

        For information about how to create this file, see [{#T}](cluster-create.md).

    1. In the {{ mkf-name }} cluster description, add a `permission` section to the `user` section:

        ```hcl
        resource "yandex_mdb_kafka_cluster" "<cluster name>" {
           user {
             name     = "<username>"
             password = "<password>"
             permission {
               topic_name = "<topic name>"
               role       = "<user role: ACCESS_ROLE_CONSUMER, ACCESS_ROLE_PRODUCER, or ACCESS_ROLE_ADMIN>"
             }
           }
           ...
        }
        ```

        The `ACCESS_ROLE_ADMIN` role is only available in a cluster with [topic management via the Admin API](../concepts/topics.md) enabled and all topics selected (`topic_name = "*"`).

    1. Make sure the settings are correct.

        {% include [terraform-validate](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/validate.md) %}

    1. Confirm the update of resources.

        {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

    For more information, see the [{{ TF }} provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/yandex-cloud/yandex/latest/docs/resources/mdb_kafka_cluster).

{% if api != "noshow" %}

- API

  Use the [grantPermission](../api-ref/User/grantPermission.md) API method and pass the following in the request:
  - The cluster ID in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
  - The account name in the `userName` parameter. To find out the name, [get a list of accounts in the cluster](#list-accounts).
  - The new permission to the topic in the `permission` parameter.

## Revoking permissions from an account {#revoke-permission}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  When [creating](#create-account) or [updating](#update-account) an account, you can revoke topic permissions.

  To revoke topic permissions:
  1. Find the desired topic in the list of topics.
  1. Delete the role that you no longer need by clicking ![image](../../_assets/cross.svg) next to the role name. To revoke all permissions to a topic, delete it from the list: hover over the topic name and click ![image](../../_assets/cross.svg) at the end of the line.

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  To revoke permissions for certain topics, pass an updated list of the `--permission` parameters:

  ```
  {{ yc-mdb-kf }} user update <username> \
  --cluster-name <cluster name>
  --permission topic=<topic name>,role=<user role: producer or consumer>
  ```

  When you update account permissions, the existing permissions are revoked and replaced with the new ones. That is, the command must always include a complete list of permissions to be assigned to the account.

  The `--permission` flag must contain at least one topic/role pair. To revoke all the permissions from an account, use the console or delete the account.
