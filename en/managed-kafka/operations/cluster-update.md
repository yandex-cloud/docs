- API

  Use the [update](../api-ref/Cluster/update.md) API method and pass the following in the request:
  - The cluster ID in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
  - In the `updateMask` parameter, a list of settings to update (in a single line, comma-separated). If this parameter is omitted, the API method resets any cluster settings that aren't explicitly specified in the request to their default values.
  - The new cluster configuration in the `configSpec` parameter.
