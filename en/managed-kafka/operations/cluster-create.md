# Creating clusters

A cluster in {{ mkf-name }} is one or more broker hosts where topics and their partitions are located. Producers and consumers can work with these topics by connecting to cluster hosts.

- Management console

  To create a cluster, follow these steps:

  1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a cluster.

  1. Select **{{ mkf-name }}**.

  1. Click **Create cluster**.

  1. Under **Basic parameters**:
     1. Enter a name for the cluster and, if necessary, a description. The cluster name must be unique within the folder.
     1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you can't change the environment once the cluster is created):
        - `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
        - `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mkf-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.
     1. Select the {{ KF }} version. The current version is `2.1`.

  1. Under **Host class**, select the platform, host type, and host class.

     The host class defines the technical specifications of the VMs where the [{{ KF }} brokers](../concepts/brokers.md) will be deployed. All available options are listed in [Host classes](../concepts/instance-types.md).
When you change the host class for the cluster, the characteristics of all existing instances change, too.

  1. Under **Storage**:
     1. Choose the [type of storage](../concepts/storage.md), either a more flexible network type (**network-hdd** or **network-ssd**) or faster local SSD storage (**local-ssd**).
     1. Select the size of storage to be used for data. The size of the local storage can only be changed in 100 GB increments.

  1. Under **Network settings**:

     1. Select one or more [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) where the {{ KF }} brokers will reside.

     1. Select the [network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md). The selected network may have no more than one subnet in each availability zone.

        If the network doesn't have any subnets for the selected availability zones, [create them](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md).

  1. Under **Hosts**, specify the number of [broker hosts](../concepts/brokers.md) {{ KF }} to be located in each of the selected availability zones.

     When choosing the number of hosts, keep in mind that:
     - The {{ KF }} cluster hosts will be evenly deployed in the selected availability zones. Decide on the number of zones and hosts per zone based on the required fault tolerance model and cluster load.
     - Replication is possible only if the cluster consists of at least two hosts.

  1. Click **Create cluster**.

- API

  To create a cluster, use the [create](../api-ref/Cluster/create.md) API method and pass the following in the request:
  - In the `folderId` parameter, the ID of the folder where  the cluster should be placed.
  - The cluster name in the `name` parameter.
