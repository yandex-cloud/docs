# Creating clusters

A cluster in {{ mkf-name }} is one or more broker hosts where topics and their partitions are located. Producers and consumers can work with these topics by connecting to cluster hosts.

{% note info %}

* The number of broker hosts that you can create together with a {{ KF }} cluster depends on the selected [storage type](../concepts/storage.md#storage-type-selection) and [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md#available-flavors).
* Available storage types [depend](../concepts/storage.md) on the selected [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md#available-flavors).

## How to create a {{ mkf-name }} cluster {#create-cluster}

Prior to creating a cluster, calculate the [minimum storage size](../concepts/storage.md#minimal-storage-size) for topics.

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the desired folder.
   1. In the list of services, select **{{ mkf-name }}**.
   1. Click **Create cluster**.
   1. Under **Basic parameters**:
      1. Enter a name for the cluster and, if necessary, a description. The cluster name must be unique within the folder.
      1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you can't change the environment once the cluster is created):
         * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
         * `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mkf-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.
      1. Select the {{ KF }} version.
      1. To [manage topics via the {{ KF }} Admin API](../concepts/topics.md#management):
         1. Enable **Manage topics via the API**.
         1. After creating a cluster, [create an admin user](./cluster-accounts.md#create-user).

         {% include [mkf-admin-api-alert](../../_includes/mdb/mkf/admin-api-alert.md) %}
      1. To manage data schemas using [{{ mkf-msr }}](../concepts/managed-schema-registry.md), enable the **Data Schema Registry** setting.

         {% include [mkf-schema-registry-alert](../../_includes/mdb/mkf/schema-registry-alert.md) %}

   1. Under **Host class**, select the platform, host type, and host class.

      The host class defines the technical capabilities of the virtual machines that [{{ KF }} brokers](../concepts/brokers.md) are deployed on. All available options are listed under [Host classes](../concepts/instance-types.md).

      By [changing the host class](cluster-update.md#change-brokers) for a cluster, you also change the characteristics of all the existing instances.

   1. Under **Storage**:

      * Select the [storage type](../concepts/storage.md).

         {% include [storages-step-settings](../../_includes/mdb/settings-storages-no-broadwell.md) %}

         You can't change the storage type of {{ mkf-name }} clusters once they are created.

      * Select the size of storage to be used for data.

   1. Under **Network settings**:
      
      1. Select one or more [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to host {{ KF }} brokers. If you create a cluster with one accessibility zone, you will not be able to increase the number of zones and brokers in the future.
      1. Select the [network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md).
      1. Select subnets in each availability zone for this network. To [create a new subnet](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md), click **Create new** subnet next to the desired availability zone.


      {% note info %}

      For a cluster with multiple broker hosts, you need to specify subnets in each availability zone even if you plan to host brokers only in some of them. These subnets are required to host three {{ ZK }} hosts â€” one in each availability zone. For more information, see [Resource relationships in {{ mkf-name }}](../concepts/index.md).

      {% endnote %}

      1. Select security groups to control the cluster's network traffic.

      1. To access broker hosts from the internet, select **Public access**. In this case, you can only connect to them over an SSL connection. You can't request public access after creating a cluster. For more information, see [{#T}](connect.md).

   1. Under **Hosts**:

      1. Specify the number of {{ KF }} [broker hosts](../concepts/brokers.md) to be located in each of the selected availability zones.

         When choosing the number of hosts, keep in mind that:

         * The {{ KF }} cluster hosts will be evenly deployed in the selected availability zones. Decide on the number of zones and hosts per zone based on the required fault tolerance model and cluster load.
         * Replication is possible if there are at least two hosts in the cluster.
         * If you selected `local-ssd` or `network-ssd-nonreplicated` under **Storage**, you need to add at least 3 hosts to the cluster.
         * Adding more than one host to the cluster automatically adds three {{ ZK }} hosts.

      
      1. (Optional) Select groups of [dedicated hosts](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md) to host the cluster on.

         {% include [Dedicated hosts note](../../_includes/mdb/mkf/note-dedicated-hosts.md) %}


   1. If you specify two or more broker hosts, then under **{{ ZK }} host class**, specify the characteristics of the [{{ ZK }} hosts](../concepts/index.md) to place in each of the selected availability zones.

   1. If necessary, configure additional cluster settings:

      {% include [extra-settings](../../_includes/mdb/mkf/extra-settings.md) %}

   1. If necessary, configure the [{{ KF }} settings](../concepts/settings-list.md#cluster-settings).

   1. Click **Create cluster**.

   1. Wait until the cluster is ready: its status on the {{ mkf-short-name }} dashboard changes to **Running** and its state to **Alive**. This may take some time.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View a description of the CLI's create cluster command:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-kf }} cluster create --help
      ```

   1. Specify the cluster parameters in the create command (only some of the supported parameters are given in the example):

      
      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-kf }} cluster create \
        --name <cluster name> \
        --environment <environment: prestable or production> \
        --version <version{{ KF }}: {{ versions.cli.str }}> \
        --network-name <network name> \
        --brokers-count <number of brokers in zone> \
        --resource-preset <host class> \
        --disk-type <network-hdd | network-ssd | local-ssd | network-ssd-nonreplicated> \
        --disk-size <storage size, GB> \
        --assign-public-ip <public access> \
        --security-group-ids <security group ID list> \
        --deletion-protection=<cluster deletion protection: true or false>
      ```


      {% include [deletion-protection-limits-data](../../_includes/mdb/deletion-protection-limits-data.md) %}

      If necessary, you can also configure the [{{ KF }} settings](../concepts/settings-list.md#cluster-settings) here.

   1. To set up a maintenance window (including windows for disabled clusters), pass the required value in the `--maintenance-window` parameter when creating your cluster:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-kf }} cluster create \
      ...
         --maintenance-window type=<maintenance type: anytime or weekly>,`
                             `day=<day of week for weekly>,`
                             `hour=<hour for weekly>
      ```

      Where:

      * `type`: Maintenance type:
         * `anytime`: Any time.
         * `weekly`: On a schedule.
      * `day`: Day of the week in `DDD` format for `weekly`. For example, `MON`.
      * `hour`: Hour in `HH` format for `weekly`. For example, `21`.

   1. To manage topics via the {{ KF }} Admin API:

      1. When creating a cluster, set the `--unmanaged-topics` parameter to `true`:

         ```bash
         {{ yc-mdb-kf }} cluster create \
           ...
           --unmanaged-topics true
         ```

         You cannot edit this setting after you create a cluster.

      1. After creating a cluster, [create an admin user](./cluster-accounts.md#create-user).

   
   1. {% include [datatransfer access](../../_includes/mdb/cli/datatransfer-access-create.md) %}

   1. To create a cluster hosted on groups of [dedicated hosts](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md), specify the host IDs as a comma-separated list in the `--host-group-ids` parameter when creating the cluster:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-kf }} cluster create \
        ...
        --host-group-ids <IDs of dedicated host groups>
      ```

      {% include [Dedicated hosts note](../../_includes/mdb/mkf/note-dedicated-hosts.md) %}


- {{ TF }}

   {% include [terraform-definition](../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}

   
   If you don't have {{ TF }}, [install it and configure the provider](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).


   To create a cluster:

   1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:

      * {{ KF }} cluster: Description of a cluster and its hosts. If necessary, you can also configure the [{{ KF }} settings](../concepts/settings-list.md#cluster-settings) here.

      * {% include [Terraform network description](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/network.md) %}

      * {% include [Terraform subnet description](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/subnet.md) %}

## Examples {#examples}

### Creating a single-host cluster {#creating-a-single-host-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   Let's say we need to create a {{ mkf-name }} cluster with the following characteristics:

   
   * With the name `mykf`.
   * In the `production` environment.
   * With {{ KF }} version `{{ versions.cli.latest }}`.
   * In the `{{ network-name }}` network.
   * In the security group `{{ security-group }}`.
   * With one `{{ host-class }}` host in the `{{ region-id }}-a` availability zone.
   * With one broker.
   * With a network SSD storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`) of 10 GB.
   * With public access.
   * With protection against accidental cluster deletion.


   Run the command:

   
   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-kf }} cluster create \
     --name mykf \
     --environment production \
     --version {{ versions.cli.latest }} \
     --network-name {{ network-name }} \
     --zone-ids {{ region-id }}-a \
     --brokers-count 1 \
     --resource-preset {{ host-class }} \
     --disk-size 10 \
     --disk-type {{ disk-type-example }} \
     --assign-public-ip \
     --security-group-ids {{ security-group }} \
     --deletion-protection=true
   ```


- {{ TF }}

   Let's say we need to create a {{ mkf-name }} cluster with the following characteristics:

   * In the cloud with the ID `{{ tf-cloud-id }}`.
   * In the folder with the ID `{{ tf-folder-id }}`.
   * With the name `mykf`.
   * In the `PRODUCTION` environment.
   * With {{ KF }} version `{{ versions.tf.latest }}`.
   * In the new `mynet` network with the subnet `mysubnet`.
   * In the new security group `mykf-sg` allowing connection to the cluster from the Internet via port `9091`.
   * With one `{{ host-class }}` host in the `{{ region-id }}-a` availability zone.
   * With one broker.
   * With a network SSD storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`) of 10 GB.
   * With public access.
   * With protection against accidental cluster deletion.
