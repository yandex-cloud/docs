# Working with topics and partitions

In {{ mkf-name }} clusters, you can:

- [Create topics and their partitions](#create-topic).
- [Update topic and partition settings](#update-topic).
- [Delete topics](#delete-topic).
- [Get a list of topics in a cluster](#list-topics).
- [Get detailed information about a topic](#get-topic).

## Create a topic {#create-topic}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  To create a topic, follow these steps:

  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mkf-name }}**.

  1. Click on the name of the cluster and select the **Topics** tab.

  1. Click **Create topic**.

  1. Under **Basic parameters**, specify:
     - The topic name (must be unique in the {{ KF }} cluster).
     - The number of topic partitions.
     - The replication factor. This parameter value should not exceed the number of brokers in the cluster.

  1. Under **Topic settings**, specify the parameters:

     - **Cleanup policy**:
       - `CLEANUP_POLICY_DELETE`: Delete log segments when either their retention time or log size limit is reached.
       - `CLEANUP_POLICY_COMPACT`: Compact messages in the log.
       - `CLEANUP_POLICY_COMPACT_AND_DELETE`: Both compact messages and delete log segments.

       For more information, see the [documentation for {{ KF }}](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#cleanup.policy).

     - **Compression type**: The codec to use for message compression:
       - `Uncompressed`: No compression.
       - `Zstd`: The Zstandard codec.
       - `Lz4`: The LZ4 codec.
       - `Snappy`: The Snappy codec.
       - `Gzip`: The GZip codec.
       - `Producer`: The codec is set by the [producer](../concepts/producers-consumers.md).

       For more information, see the [documentation for {{ KF }}](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#compression.type).

     - **Delete delay, ms**: The time to wait before deleting a file from the filesystem.

       For more information, see the [documentation for {{ KF }}](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#file.delete.delay.ms).

     - **Maximum number of messages in memory**: The number of topic messages that can be kept in memory before these messages are flushed to disk. For example, if the parameter is `1`, the disk is flushed after each message is received. If it's set to `5`, messages are flushed to disk in groups of five.

       For more information, see the [documentation for {{ KF }}](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#flush.messages).

     - **Message retention time, ms**: The time that a message in any topic is kept in memory before it's flushed to disk.

       For more information, see the [documentation for {{ KF }}](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#flush.ms).

     - **Minimum compaction lag, ms**: The minimum time a message will remain uncompacted in the log.

       For more information, see the [documentation for {{ KF }}](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#min.compaction.lag.ms).

     - **Maximum partition size, bytes**: The maximum size that a partition can grow to. After reaching this limit, {{ KF }} starts deleting old log segments. This setting applies if the `CLEANUP_POLICY_DELETE` log cleanup policy is in effect.

       It's helpful if you need to control the size of a log due to limited disk space.

       For more information, see the [documentation for {{ KF }}](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#retention.bytes).

     - **Log segment lifetime, ms**: The time after which {{ KF }} starts deleting old log segments. This setting applies if the `CLEANUP_POLICY_DELETE` log cleanup policy is in effect.

       For more information, see the [documentation for {{ KF }}](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#retention.ms).

  1. Click **Create**.

{% if api != "noshow" %}

- API

  Use the [create](../api-ref/Topic/create.md) API method and pass the following in the request:
  - In the `clusterId` parameter, the ID of the cluster where you want to create a topic. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
  - Topic settings in the `topicSpec` parameter.

{% endif %}

{% endlist %}

{% if api != "noshow" %}

## Update topic settings {#update-topic}

{% list tabs %}

- API

  Use the [update](../api-ref/Topic/update.md) API method and pass the following in the request:
  - In the `clusterId` parameter, the ID of the cluster where the topic is located. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
  - The topic name in the `topicName` parameter. To find out the name, [get a list of topics in the cluster](#list-topics).
  - In the `updateMask` parameter, a list of settings to update (in a single line, comma-separated). If this parameter is omitted, the API method resets any topic settings that aren't explicitly specified in the `topicSpec` parameter to their default values.
  - New values for the topic settings in the `topicSpec` parameter.

{% endlist %}

{% endif %}

## Delete a topic {#delete-topic}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  To delete a topic, follow these steps:
  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mkf-name }}**.

  1. Click ![image](../../_assets/options.svg) for the necessary topic and select **Delete**.
  1. Confirm topic deletion and click **Delete**.

{% if api != "noshow" %}

- API

  Use the [delete](../api-ref/Topic/delete.md) API method and pass the following in the request:
  - In the `clusterId` parameter, the ID of the cluster where the topic is located. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
  - The topic name in the `topicName` parameter. To find out the name, [get a list of topics in the cluster](#list-topics).

{% endif %}

{% endlist %}

## Get a list of topics in a cluster {#list-topics}

  1. Click on the name of the cluster and select the **Topics** tab.

{% if api != "noshow" %}

- API

  Use the [list](../api-ref/Topic/list.md) API method: pass the ID of the required cluster in the `clusterId` request parameter.

  To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

{% endif %}

{% endlist %}

## Get detailed information about a topic {#get-topic}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  To get detailed information about a topic, follow these steps:
