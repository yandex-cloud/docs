# Getting started with {{ mkf-name }}

To get started with the service:
1. [Create a cluster](#cluster-create).
1. [Create a topic](#topic-create).
1. [Create a user](#account-create).
1. [Connect to the cluster](#connect).


## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and log in to {{ yandex-cloud }} or create an account if you do not have one yet.

1. If you do not have a folder yet, create one:

   {% include [create-folder](../_includes/create-folder.md) %}

1. You can connect to an {{ KF }} cluster from both inside and outside {{ yandex-cloud }}:

   * To connect from inside {{ yandex-cloud }}, create a [Linux-](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md) virtual machine, which must be in the same network as the cluster.

   * To connect to a cluster from the internet, enable public access to the cluster when [creating](operations/cluster-create.md) it.

   {% note info %}

   The next step assumes that you connect to the cluster from a [Linux](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md)-based VM.

   {% endnote %}

1. [Connect](../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM via SSH.

1. Install the `kafkacat` utility, an open source application that can function as a universal data producer or consumer:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install kafkacat
   ```


## Create a cluster {#cluster-create}

To create a cluster:
1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a cluster.
1. Select **{{ mkf-name }}**.
1. Click **Create cluster**.
1. Set the cluster parameters and click **Create cluster**. This process is described in detail in [{#T}](operations/cluster-create.md).
1. Wait until the cluster is ready: its status on the {{ mkf-name }} dashboard changes to **Running** and its state to **Alive**. This may take some time.

Then create a topic in the cluster.

## Create the topic {#topic-create}

A [topic](concepts/topics.md) is a way to group message streams into categories. [Producers](concepts/producers-consumers.md) write messages to a topic and [consumers](concepts/producers-consumers.md) read messages from it.

To create a topic:
1. In the management console, select the folder where the cluster is located.
1. Select **{{ mkf-name }}**.
1. Click on the name of the cluster you created and select the **Topics** tab.
1. Click **Create topic**.
1. Specify the topic settings and click **Create**. This process is described in detail in [{#T}](operations/cluster-topics.md).

Then create users for producers and consumers.

## Create a user {#account-create}

User settings let you manage [producer and consumer](./concepts/producers-consumers.md) permissions to cluster topics.

To create a user:
1. In the management console, select the folder where the cluster is located.
1. Select **{{ mkf-name }}**.
1. Click on the name of the cluster you created and select the **Users** tab.
1. Click **Add**.
1. Enter a username and password (from 8 to 128 characters).
1. Click **![image](../_assets/plus.svg) Add topic** and select a previously created topic from the drop-down list.
1. Add permissions to this topic for the producer and consumer. This process is described in detail in [{#T}](operations/cluster-accounts.md).
1. Click **Add**.

Then connect to the cluster using this username.

## Connect to the cluster {#connect}

You can connect the producer and consumer to the cluster on behalf of one user. Both the producer and consumer will only be able to work with the topics that this user is allowed to access.

To connect to a cluster:


1. If you are using security groups for a cloud network, [configure them](operations/connect.md#configuring-security-groups) to enable all relevant traffic between the cluster and the connecting host.

   {% include [preview-pp.md](../_includes/preview-pp.md) %}


1. Install an SSL certificate on the VM:

   {% include [install-certificate](../_includes/mdb/mkf/install-certificate.md) %}

1. To send a message to a topic, run the command:

   {% include [default-get-string](../_includes/mdb/mkf/default-send-string.md) %}

   In the command, specify the broker FQDN, the topic name, and the username and password of the {{ KF }} user that you created in the previous step.

   {% include [see-fqdn-in-console](../_includes/mdb/see-fqdn-in-console.md) %}

1. To get messages from a topic, run the following command:

   {% include [default-get-string](../_includes/mdb/mkf/default-get-string.md) %}

   In the command, specify the broker FQDN, the topic name, and the username and password of the {{ KF }} user that you created in the previous step.

   {% include [see-fqdn-in-console](../_includes/mdb/see-fqdn-in-console.md) %}
