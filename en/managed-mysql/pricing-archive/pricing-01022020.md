# {{ mmy-name }} pricing policy before February 1, 2020

This is an old version of the policy, valid before February 1, 2020. To learn more about the current {{ mmy-name }} pricing policy, see [Pricing policy](../pricing.md).

{% include [currency-choice](../../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}

{% include [pricing-status.md](../../_includes/mdb/pricing-status.md) %}

{% include [pricing-status-warning.md](../../_includes/mdb/pricing-status-warning.md) %}


## What goes into the cost of using {{ mmy-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mmy-name }} usage cost is based on:

* Disk type and storage size.

* [Host class](../concepts/instance-types.md) selected for the cluster.

* Number of DB hosts per cluster.

* Settings and number of backups.

* Amount of outgoing traffic.


{% include [pricing-gb-size](../../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### DB host usage {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of the host's operation in accordance with its class. You can find detailed class specifications in the [Host classes](../concepts/instance-types.md) section.

The minimum billing unit is one hour (for example, 1.5 hours of operation cost the same as 2 hours). You are not paying for the time when the {{ MY }} host is unable to perform its main functions.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

You pay for the following:

* Storage allocated for DB clusters.

   * Storage on fast local disks (`local-ssd`) can only be ordered for clusters with more than 3 hosts in 100 GB increments.


* Space used by DB backups in excess of the storage amount specified for the cluster.

   * Backups are stored free of charge as long as the combined size of the DB and all backups is smaller than the selected storage size.

   * The number of hosts in a cluster does not affect the storage size and, therefore, the free volume of backups.

The cost is specified for one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per hour (e.g., storing 1 GB for 1.5 hours costs the same as for 2 hours).


## Pricing {#prices}

{% note info %}

As of February 1, 2020, service pricing [changes](pricing-01022020.md#prices): the cost of clusters will be calculated directly based on the computing resources used, not the host class.
