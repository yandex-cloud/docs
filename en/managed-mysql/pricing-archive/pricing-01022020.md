# Pricing rules for {{ mmy-name }} before February 1, 2020

{% include [currency-choice](../../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}

{% include [pricing-status.md](../../_includes/mdb/pricing-status.md) %}

{% include [pricing-status-warning.md](../../_includes/mdb/pricing-status-warning.md) %}


## What goes into the cost of using {{ mmy-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mmy-name }} usage cost is based on:

* Disk type and storage size.

* The [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md) selected for the cluster.

* The number of DB hosts in the cluster.

* Settings and number of backups.

* The amount of outgoing traffic.


{% include [pricing-gb-size](../../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### DB host usage {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of the host's operation in accordance with its class. Exact class characteristics are given in [{#T}](../concepts/instance-types.md).

The minimum billing unit is one hour (for example, the cost of 1.5 hours of operation is the same as the cost of 2 hours of operation). You are not charged for time when the {{ MY }} host is not performing its main functions.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

The following is charged:

* Storage allocated for DB clusters.

   * Storage on fast local disks (`local-ssd`) can only be ordered for clusters with more than 3 hosts in 100 GB increments.


* Space used by DB backups in excess of the storage amount specified for the cluster.

   * Backups are stored free of charge as long as the combined size of the database and all backups is less than the storage volume selected.

   * The number of hosts in the cluster doesn't affect the size of the storage and, consequently, of free backups.

The cost is specified for one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per hour (for example, the cost of storing 1 GB for 1.5 hours is equal to the cost of storage for 2 hours).


## Pricing {#prices}

{% note info %}

As of February 1, 2020, service pricing [changes](pricing-01022020.md#prices): the cost of clusters will be calculated directly based on the computing resources used, not the host class.
