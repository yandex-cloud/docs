# Connecting to a database in a {{ MY }} cluster

You can connect to {{ mmy-short-name }} cluster hosts:

{% include [cluster-connect-note](../../_includes/mdb/mmy/cluster-connect-note.md) %}

{% note warning %}

If only some cluster hosts have public access configured, the master may not be accessible from the internet when it [changes automatically](../concepts/replication.md#master-failover).

{% endnote %}

The maximum number of connections is defined by the [Max connections](../concepts/settings-list.md#setting-max-connections) setting that [depends on the host class](../concepts/settings-list.md#settings-instance-dependent).

For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/network.md).


## Configuring security groups {#configure-security-groups}

{% include [security-groups-note](../../_includes/vpc/security-groups-note-services.md) %}

{% include [sg-rules](../../_includes/mdb/sg-rules-connect.md) %}

Rule settings depend on the connection method you select:

{% list tabs %}

- Over the internet

   [Configure all security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) in the cluster to allow incoming traffic on port {{ port-mmy }} from any IP address. To do this, create the following rule for incoming traffic:

   * Port range: `{{ port-mmy }}`.
   * Protocol: `TCP`.
   * Source: `CIDR`.
   * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

- From a VM in {{ yandex-cloud }}

   1. [Configure all security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) in the cluster to allow incoming traffic from the security group where your VM is located on port {{ port-mmy }}. To do this, create the following rule for incoming traffic in these groups:

      * Port range: `{{ port-mmy }}`.
      * Protocol: `TCP`.
      * Source: `Security group`.
      * Security group: If a cluster and a VM are in the same security group, select `Self` (`Self`) as the value. Otherwise, specify the VM security group.

   1. [Configure the security group](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) where the VM is located to allow connections to the VM and traffic between the VM and the cluster hosts.

      Example of rules for a VM:

      * For incoming traffic:
         * Port range: `{{ port-ssh }}`.
         * Protocol: `TCP`.
         * Source: `CIDR`.
         * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

         This rule allows you to [connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to the VM over SSH.

      * For outgoing traffic:
         * Port range: `{{ port-any }}`.
         * Protocol: `Any`.
         * Destination type: `CIDR`.
         * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

         This rule allows all outgoing traffic, which enables you to both connect to the cluster and install the certificates and utilities the VMs need to connect to the cluster.

{% endlist %}

{% note info %}

You can set more detailed rules for security groups, such as allowing traffic in only specific subnets.

Security groups must be configured correctly for all subnets that will include cluster hosts. If the security group settings are incomplete or incorrect, you might lose access the cluster.

{% endnote %}

For more information about security groups, see [{#T}](../concepts/network.md#security-groups).


## Getting an SSL certificate {#get-ssl-cert}

{{ MY }} hosts with public access only support encrypted connections. To use them, get an SSL certificate:

{% include [install-certificate](../../_includes/mdb/mmy/install-certificate.md) %}

{% include [ide-ssl-cert](../../_includes/mdb/mdb-ide-ssl-cert.md) %}

## Special FQDNs {#special-fqdns}

Just like usual FQDNs, which can be requested with a [list of cluster hosts](./hosts.md#list), {{ mmy-name }} provides a number of special FQDNs, which can also be used when connecting to a cluster.

{% note warning %}

If, when the [master host is changed automatically](../concepts/replication.md#master-failover), a host with no public access becomes a new master or the most recent replica, you will not be able to access them from the internet. To avoid this, [enable public access](../operations/hosts.md#update) for all cluster hosts.

{% endnote %}

### Current master {#fqdn-master}

Such FQDN as `c-<cluster ID>.rw.{{ dns-zone }}` always points to the current cluster master host. You can get the cluster ID with a [list of clusters in the folder](./cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

When connecting to this FQDN, both read and write operations are allowed.

Example of connecting to a master host for a cluster with the ID `c9qash3nb1v9ulc8j9nm`:

```bash
mysql --host=c-c9qash3nb1v9ulc8j9nm.rw.{{ dns-zone }} \
      --port=3306 \
      --ssl-ca=~/.mysql/root.crt \
      --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY \
      --user=<username> \
      --password \
      <DB name>
```

### Most recent replica {#fqdn-replica}

Such FQDN as `c-<cluster ID>.ro.{{ dns-zone }}` points to the most recent [replica](../concepts/replication.md), i.e., the one most up-to-date with the master host. The cluster ID can be requested with a [list of clusters in the folder](./cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

**Specifics:**

* When connecting to this FQDN, only read operations are allowed.
* If there are no active replicas in a cluster, you cannot connect to this FQDN, as the respective DNS CNAME record will point to a `null` object.

Here is an example of connecting to the most recent replica for a cluster with the `c9qash3nb1v9ulc8j9nm` ID:

```bash
mysql --host=c-c9qash3nb1v9ulc8j9nm.ro.{{ dns-zone }} \
      --port=3306 \
      --ssl-ca=~/.mysql/root.crt \
      --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY \
      --user=<username> \
      --password \
      <DB name>
```

## Connecting to cluster hosts from graphical IDEs {#connection-ide}

{% include [ide-environments](../../_includes/mdb/mdb-ide-envs.md) %}

You can only use graphical IDEs to connect to public cluster hosts using SSL certificates.

{% include [note-connection-ide](../../_includes/mdb/note-connection-ide.md) %}
