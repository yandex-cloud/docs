# Creating {{ MY }} clusters

{{ MY }} clusters are one or more database hosts that replication can be configured between. Replication is enabled by default in any cluster consisting of more than one host: the master host accepts write requests, synchronously duplicates changes in the primary replica, and does it asynchronously in all the others.

{% if audience != "internal" %}

The number of hosts that can be created with a {{ MY }} cluster depends on the storage option selected:

  - When using network drives, you can request any number of hosts (from one to the current [quota](../concepts/limits.md) limit).
  - When using SSDs, you can create at least three replicas along with the cluster (a minimum of three replicas is required to ensure fault tolerance). If the [available folder resources](../concepts/limits.md) are still sufficient after creating a cluster, you can add extra replicas.

{% endif %}

By default, {{ mmy-short-name }} limits the maximum number of connections to each {{ MY }} cluster host to ` 200 x <number of vCPUs on host>`. For example, for a [s1.micro class](../concepts/instance-types.md) host, the `max_connections` default parameter value is 400.

{% note info %}

If database storage is 95% full, the cluster switches to read-only mode. Increase the storage size in advance.

## How to create a cluster {{ MY }} {#create-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a DB cluster.

  1. Select **{{ mmy-name }}**.

  1. Click **Create cluster**.

  1. Enter the cluster name in the **Cluster name** field. The cluster name must be unique within the Cloud.

  1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you can't change the environment once the cluster is created):
      - `PRODUCTION`: for stable versions of your apps.
      - `PRESTABLE`: for testing, including the {{ mmy-short-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.

  1. Select the DBMS version.

  1. Select the host class that defines the technical specifications of the VMs where the DB hosts will be deployed. All available options are listed in [{#T}](../concepts/instance-types.md). When you change the host class for the cluster, the characteristics of all existing hosts change, too.

  1. Under **Storage size**:
      - Select the type of storage, either a more flexible network type (**network-hdd** or **network-ssd**) or faster local SSD storage (**local-ssd**). The size of the local storage can only be changed in 100 GB increments.
      - Select the size to be used for data and backups. For more information about how backups take up storage space, see [{#T}](../concepts/backup.md).

  1. Under **Database**, specify the DB attributes:
      - Database name. The DB name must be unique within the folder and contain only Latin letters, numbers, and underscores.
      - The name of the user who is the DB owner. The username may only contain Latin letters, numbers, and underscores.
      - User password (from 8 to 128 characters).

  1. Under **Hosts**, select parameters for the database hosts created with the cluster (keep in mind that if you use SSDs when creating a {{ MY }} cluster, you can set at least three hosts). If you open **Advanced settings**, you can choose specific subnets for each host. By default, each host is created in a separate subnet.

  1. Click **Create cluster**.

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  To create a cluster:

  1. Check whether the folder has any subnets for the cluster hosts:

     ```
     $ yc vpc subnet list
     ```

     If there are no subnets in the folder, [create the necessary subnets](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) in {{ vpc-short-name }}.

  1. View a description of the CLI's create cluster command:

      ```
      $ {{ yc-mdb-my }} cluster create --help
      ```

  1. Specify the cluster parameters in the create command:

     ```
     $ {{ yc-mdb-my }} cluster create \
        --cluster-name <cluster name> \
        --environment <prestable or production> \
        --network-name <network name> \
        --host zone-id=<availability zone>,subnet-id=<subnet ID> \
        --mysql-version <MySQL version> \
        --resource-preset <host class> \
        --user name=<username>,password=<user password> \
        --database name=<DB name>
     ```

      The subnet ID `subnet-id` should be specified if the selected availability zone contains two or more subnets.

- Terraform

  {% include [terraform-definition](../../solutions/_solutions_includes/terraform-definition.md) %}

  If you don't have Terraform yet, [install it and configure the provider](../../solutions/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

  To create a cluster:

  1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:

     {% include [terraform-create-cluster-step-1](../../_includes/mdb/terraform-create-cluster-step-1.md) %}

     Example configuration file structure:

     ```yaml
     resource "yandex_mdb_mysql_cluster" "<cluster name>" {
       name        = "<cluster name>"
       environment = "<PRESTABLE or PRODUCTION>"
       network_id  = "<network ID>"
       version     = "<MySQL version: 5.7 or 8.0>"
     
       resources {
         resource_preset_id = "<host class>"
         disk_type_id       = "<storage type>"
         disk_size          = "<storage size in GB>"
       }
     
       database {
         name = "<DB name>"
       }
     
       user {
         name     = "<user name>"
         password = "<user password>"
         permission {
           database_name = "<DB name>"
           roles         = ["ALL"]
         } 
       }
     
       host {
         zone      = "<availability zone>"
         subnet_id = "<subnet ID>"
       }
     }
     
     resource "yandex_vpc_network" "<network name>" { name = "<network name>" }
     
     resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "<subnet name>" {
       name           = "<subnet name>"
       zone           = "<availability zone>"
       network_id     = "<network ID>"
       v4_cidr_blocks = ["<range>"]
     }
     ```

     For more information about resources that you can create using Terraform, see the [provider's documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/yandex/r/mdb_mysql_cluster.html).

  1. Make sure that the configuration files are correct.

     {% include [terraform-create-cluster-step-2](../../_includes/mdb/terraform-create-cluster-step-2.md) %}

  1. Create a cluster.

     {% include [terraform-create-cluster-step-3](../../_includes/mdb/terraform-create-cluster-step-3.md) %}

## Examples {#examples}

### Creating a single-host cluster {#creating-a-single-host-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- Terraform

  Let's say we need to create a {{ MY }} cluster and a network for it with the following characteristics:
  - Named `my-mysql`.
  - Version `8.0`.
  - In the `PRESTABLE` environment.
  - In the cloud with ID `b1gq90dgh25иuebiu75o`.
  - In a folder named `myfolder`.
  - Network: `mynet`.
  - 1 `{{ host-class }}` class host in the new `mysubnet` subnet and `{{ zone-id }}` availability zone. The `mysubnet` subnet will have a range of `10.5.0.0/24`.
  - With 20 GB fast network storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`).
  - With one user (`user1`) with the password `user1user1`.
  - With 1 `db1` database, in which `user1` has full rights (the same as `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on db1.*`).

  The configuration file for the cluster looks like this:

  ```yaml
  provider "yandex" {
    token = "<OAuth or static key of service account>"
    cloud_id  = "b1gq90dgh25иuebiu75o"
    folder_id = "${data.yandex_resourcemanager_folder.myfolder.id}"
    zone      = "{{ zone-id }}"
  }
  
  resource "yandex_mdb_mysql_cluster" "my-mysql" {
    name        = "my-mysql"
    environment = "PRESTABLE"
    network_id  = "${yandex_vpc_network.mynet.id}"
    version     = "8.0"
  
    resources {
      resource_preset_id = "{{ host-class }}"
      disk_type_id       = "{{ disk-type-example }}"
      disk_size          = 20
    }
  
    database {
      name = "db1"
    }
  
    user {
      name     = "user1"
      password = "user1user1"
      permission {
        database_name = "db1"
        roles         = ["ALL"]
      } 
    }
  
    host {
      zone      = "{{ zone-id }}"
      subnet_id = "${yandex_vpc_subnet.mysubnet.id}"
    }
  }
  
  resource "yandex_vpc_network" "mynet" { name = "mynet" }
  
  resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "mysubnet" {
    name           = "mysubnet"
    zone           = "{{ zone-id }}"
    network_id     = "${yandex_vpc_network.mynet.id}"
    v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.5.0.0/24"]
  }
  ```
