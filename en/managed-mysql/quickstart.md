# Getting started with {{ mmy-name }}Â®

To get started with the service:
* [Create a database cluster](#cluster-create).
* [Connect to the DB](#connect).


## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and log in to {{ yandex-cloud }} or create an account if you do not have one yet.
1. If you do not have a [folder](../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) yet, create one:

   {% include [create-folder](../_includes/create-folder.md) %}

1. You can connect to DB [clusters](concepts/index.md) from both inside and outside {{ yandex-cloud }}:
   * To connect to a DB cluster from inside {{ yandex-cloud }}, create a [VM](../compute/concepts/vm.md) in the same [cloud network](../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) as the DB cluster (with [Linux](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md)).
   * To connect to the {{ mmy-name }} cluster from the internet, request public access to hosts when creating the cluster.

   {% note info %}

   The next step assumes that you are connecting to the {{ mmy-name }} cluster from a [Linux](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md)-based VM.

   {% endnote %}

1. [Connect](../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM via SSH.
1. Install the required dependencies and the {{ MY }} client:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y mysql-client
   ```


## Create a cluster {#cluster-create}

1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a DB cluster.
1. Select **{{ mmy-name }}**.
1. Click **Create cluster**.
1. Set the {{ mmy-name }} cluster parameters and click **Create cluster**. This process is described in detail in [{#T}](operations/cluster-create.md).
1. Wait until the {{ mmy-name }} cluster is ready: its status on the {{ mmy-name }} dashboard will change to **Running** and its state to **Alive**. This may take some time.

## Connect to the DB {#connect}


1. If you are using [security groups](../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) for a cloud network, [configure them](operations/connect.md#configuring-security-groups) to enable all relevant traffic between the {{ mmy-name }} cluster and the connecting host.

   {% include [preview-pp.md](../_includes/preview-pp.md) %}

   {% include [security-groups-note](../_includes/vpc/security-groups-note-services.md) %}


1. To connect to the DB server, get an SSL certificate:

   {% include [install-certificate](../_includes/mdb/mmy/install-certificate.md) %}

1. Use the `mysql` command to connect:

   {% include [default-connstring](../_includes/mdb/mmy/default-connstring.md) %}
