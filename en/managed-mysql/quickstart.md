# Getting started with {{ mmy-name }}Â®

To get started with the service:
* [Create a DB cluster](#cluster-create).
* [Connect to the DB](#connect).

{% if audience == "internal" %}

For the internal MDB service, the [web interface](https://yc.yandex-team.ru) is deployed where you can manually create a database cluster. For more information about [quotas](link-console-quotas)and the correlation between ABC services and clouds and folders, see [{#T}](../mdb/access.md).

## Access to DB clusters {#access}

The rules for accessing MDB clusters are already given{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %} in [Puncher](https://puncher.yandex-team.ru/): from [Yandex server networks](https://puncher.yandex-team.ru/?id=5ce6a766d89cb04f14acafb3) and for [developers](https://puncher.yandex-team.ru/?id=61f8da624928bbfd5d61d651){% endif %}.

If you need more rules, request access to the `_PGAASINTERNALNETS_` macro. To connect to {{ MY }} hosts, you need access to port 3306.

## CLI setup

If you plan to use the CLI, install and configure it by following the [instructions](../cli/quickstart.md).

If you did everything correctly, the list clusters query should now work:

```bash
{{ yc-mdb-my }} cluster list
```

{% else %}

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and log in to {{ yandex-cloud }} or register if you don't have an account yet.
1. If you don't have a folder yet, create one:

   {% include [create-folder](../_includes/create-folder.md) %}

1. You can connect to DB clusters from both inside and outside {{ yandex-cloud }}:
   * To connect to a DB cluster from inside {{ yandex-cloud }}, {% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}create a VM{% endif %}{% if product == "cloud-il" %}[create a Linux VM](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md){% endif %} in the same cloud network as the DB cluster{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %} (with [Linux](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md) or [Windows](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-windows.md)){% endif %}.
   * To be able to connect to the cluster from the internet, request public access to hosts when creating the cluster.

   {% note info %}

   The next step assumes that you connect to the cluster from a [Linux](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md)-based VM.

   {% endnote %}

1. [Connect](../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM via SSH.
1. Install the necessary dependencies and the {{ MY }} client:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y mysql-client
   ```

{% endif %}

## Create a cluster {#cluster-create}

1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a DB cluster.
1. Select **{{ mmy-name }}**.
1. Click **Create cluster**.
1. Set the cluster parameters and click **Create cluster**. This process is described in detail in [{#T}](operations/cluster-create.md).
1. When the cluster is ready, its status on the {{ mmy-name }} dashboard changes to **Running** and its state to **Alive**. This may take some time.

## Connect to the DB {#connect}

1. [Configure security groups](operations/connect.md#configuring-security-groups) for the cloud network to enable all the relevant traffic between the cluster and the connecting host.
1. To connect to the DB server, get an SSL certificate:

    {% include [install-certificate](../_includes/mdb/mmy/install-certificate.md) %}

1. Use the `mysql` command to connect:

   {% include [default-connstring](../_includes/mdb/mmy/default-connstring.md) %}
