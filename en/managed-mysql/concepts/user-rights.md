# User permissions

{{ MY }} manages user permissions at three levels:

* Cluster host (administrative privileges).
* Individual database (database privileges).
* Individual DB object, such as a table or index (privileges for database objects).

The user permissions and settings that apply in a {{ mmy-name }} cluster are common to all cluster hosts.

The permissions that apply at the level of the entire DB cluster (`PROCESS`, `REPLICATION CLIENT`, and `REPLICATION SLAVE`) are set in the [user settings](./settings-list.md#setting-administrative-privileges).

To differentiate the user permissions at the level of individual databases, each user is granted one or more _privileges_. Each privilege allows the user to perform the actions specified in the [privilege description](#db-privileges). A user is created along with a cluster and this user is granted `ALL_PRIVILEGES` in the first database of the cluster.

To manage user permissions for the [entire cluster](./settings-list.md#dbms-user-settings) or an [individual database](../operations/grant.md), use the {{ yandex-cloud }} interfaces. Changes made by SQL commands at these levels are not saved: the cluster returns to the state set through the {{ yandex-cloud }} interfaces.

To manage user permissions at the level of an individual DB object, use the `GRANT` and `REVOKE` SQL commands.
