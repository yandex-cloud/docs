# Storage types

{{ mmy-name }} lets you use network and local storage for database clusters. Network storage is based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. Local storage is organized on disks that are physically located in the database host servers.

## Local storage features {#Local-storage-features}

Local storage doesn't provide fault tolerance for data storage and affects the overall pricing for the cluster:

* Local storage doesn't provide fault tolerance for a single-host cluster: if a local disk fails, the data is permanently lost. Therefore, when creating a new {{ mmy-name }} cluster using local storage, a 3-host fault-tolerant configuration is automatically set up.
* You are charged for a cluster with local storage even if it's stopped. Read more in the [pricing policy](../pricing.md).
