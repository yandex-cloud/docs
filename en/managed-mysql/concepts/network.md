# DB network and clusters


When creating a cluster, you can:

* Set the network for the cluster itself.
* Set the subnets for each host in the cluster.
* Request a public IP address to access the cluster from outside {{ yandex-cloud }}.

You can create a cluster without specifying any subnets for the hosts, if the availability zone selected for each host contains exactly one subnet of the cluster network.

## Hostname and FQDN {#hostname}

{{ mmy-short-name }} generates a name for each cluster host during creation. This name will be the host's fully qualified domain name (FQDN). The hostname and, consequently, the FQDN cannot be changed.


You can use the FQDN to access the host within a single cloud network. Read more in the [{{ vpc-full-name }} documentation](../../vpc/).

### Special FQDNs {#special-fqdns}

Just like usual FQDNs that can be requested with a [list of cluster hosts](../operations/hosts.md#list), {{ mmy-name }} provides a number of special FQDNs that can also be used when connecting to a cluster.

#### Current master {#fqdn-master}

An FQDN in the format `c-<cluster ID>.rw.{{ dns-zone }}` always points to the current master host in the cluster.

{% include [Getting the Cluster ID](../../_includes/mdb/mmy/note-api-get-cluster-id.md) %}

When connecting to this FQDN, both read and write operations are allowed.

An example of connecting to a master host for a cluster with the ID `c9qash3nb1v9ulc8j9nm`:

```bash
mysql --host=c-c9qash3nb1v9ulc8j9nm.rw.{{ dns-zone }} \
      --port=3306 \
      --ssl-ca=~/.mysql/root.crt \
      --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY \
      --user=<username> \
      --password \
      <DB name>
```

#### The least lagging replica {#fqdn-replica}

An FQDN like `c-<cluster ID>.ro.{{ dns-zone }}` points to the [replica](../concepts/replication.md) that is least lagging from the master host. The cluster name can be requested with a [list of clusters in the folder](../operations/cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

**Specifics:**

* When connecting to this FQDN, only read operations are allowed.
* If there are no active replicas in the cluster, you can't connect to this FQDN: the corresponding CNAME record in the DNS will point to <q>nowhere</q> (`null`).

An example of connecting to the least lagging replica for a cluster with the ID `c9qash3nb1v9ulc8j9nm`:

```bash
mysql --host=c-c9qash3nb1v9ulc8j9nm.ro.{{ dns-zone }} \
      --port=3306 \
      --ssl-ca=~/.mysql/root.crt \
      --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY \
      --user=<username> \
      --password \
      <DB name>
```

## Public access to a host {#public-access-to-host}

Any cluster host can be accessible from outside {{ yandex-cloud }} if you requested public access when creating the host. To connect to this kind of host, use its FQDN.

It is not possible to request a public address after creating a host, but you can replace one of the existing hosts with a new host that has a public address.

When deleting a host with a public FQDN, the assigned IP address is revoked.

## Connecting to cluster hosts {#cluster-connect}

[You can connect to {{ mmy-short-name }} cluster hosts](../operations/connect.md):

{% include [cluster-connect-note](../../_includes/mdb/cluster-connect-note.md) %}

The maximum number of connections is defined by the [max_connections](./settings-list.md#setting-max-connections) setting, which [depends on the host class](./settings-list.md#settings-instance-dependent).

## Security groups {#security-groups}

{% include [sg-rules-limits](../../_includes/mdb/sg-rules-limits.md) %}

{% note tip %}

When connecting to a cluster from within its cloud network, be sure to [configure](../operations/connect.md#configure-security-groups) security groups both for the cluster and the connecting host.

{% endnote %}

{% include [sg-rules-concept](../../_includes/mdb/sg-rules-concept.md) %}
