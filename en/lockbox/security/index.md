# Access management in {{ lockbox-name }}

In this section, you'll learn:
* [Which resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#choosing-roles) for particular actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

## What resources you can assign roles to {#resources}

Roles can be assigned for a [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder), or secret. These roles also apply to nested resources. The diagram shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. For example, the `editor` role includes all `viewer` role permissions. A description of each role is given under the diagram.

## What roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

You can manage access to secrets using both service and primitive roles.

Active roles in the service:
* Service roles:
   * {% include [lockbox-admin](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/lockbox-admin.md) %}
   * {% include [lockbox-editor](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/lockbox-editor.md) %}
   * {% include [lockbox-viewer](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/lockbox-viewer.md) %}
   * {% include [lockbox-payloadviewer](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/lockbox-payloadViewer.md) %}
   * {% include [resource-manager.clouds.owner](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/resource-manager.clouds.owner.md) %}
   * {% include [resource-manager.clouds.member](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/resource-manager.clouds.member.md) %}
* Primitive roles:
   * {% include [viewer](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/viewer.md) %}
   * {% include [editor](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/editor.md) %}
   * {% include [admin](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/admin.md) %}

## What roles do I need {#choosing-roles}

The table below lists the roles needed to perform a given action. You can always assign a role granting more permissions than the role specified. For example, you can assign `editor` instead of `viewer`.

| Action | `{{ roles-lockbox-admin }}` | `{{ roles-lockbox-editor }}` | `{{ roles-lockbox-viewer }}` | `{{ roles-lockbox-payloadviewer }}` |
