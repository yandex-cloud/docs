# Host classes

The host class determines the computing power allocated for each host in the cluster. When you change the host class for a cluster, all existing hosts change to match it.

{% if audience != "internal" %}
The available storage doesn't depend on the host class. For storage limitations, see [{#T}](limits.md).

Hosts in {{ mms-name }} clusters are deployed on {{ compute-full-name }} VMs. You can create these VMs on any of the platforms that {{ compute-name }} supports. For a detailed description of the platforms, see [{#T}](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md).

The full list of possible host configurations on each platform is provided below:

* **s2**: Standard configurations, with 4:1 GB RAM to vCPU ratio.

* **m2**: Configurations with an increased GB RAM to vCPU ratio (8:1). These configurations can be useful for clusters with higher cache requirements.
