# Storage types


{{ mms-name }} lets you use network and local storage drives for database clusters. Network storage drives are based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. Local disks are physically located in the database host servers.

## Specifics of local SSD storage {#local-storage-features}

Local SSD storage doesn't provide fault tolerance for stored data and affects the overall pricing for the cluster:

* This storage doesn't provide fault tolerance for a single-host cluster: if a local disk fails, the data is permanently lost. Therefore, when creating a new {{ mms-name }} cluster using local storage, a 3-host fault-tolerant configuration is automatically set up.
* You are charged for a cluster with this storage type even if it's stopped. Read more in the [pricing policy](../pricing).
