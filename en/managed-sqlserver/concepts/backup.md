# Backups

{{ mms-short-name }} provides automatic and manual database backups.

{{ mms-name }} lets you restore a cluster to a state _at any point in time_ (Point-in-Time-Recovery, PITR) between the time you created the oldest backup and the time you archived the most recent transaction log. For this purpose, the backup selected as the recovery starting point is updated with entries from the cluster transaction log.

When creating backups and restoring data from them to a given point in time, keep in mind the following:

* The transaction log is archived in a running cluster every 20 minutes and then uploaded to object storage.

* It takes some time to create and upload a transaction log archive to object storage. This is why the cluster state stored in object storage may differ from the actual one.

For more information about PITR, see the [{{ MS }} documentation]({{ ms.docs }}/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-a-sql-server-database-to-a-point-in-time-full-recovery-model?view=sql-server-2016).

To restore a cluster or an individual database from a backup, [follow the instructions](../operations/cluster-backups.md).

{% note warning %}

You cannot use SQL commands to modify the [recovery model]({{ ms.docs }}/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/recovery-models-sql-server?view=sql-server-2016) for backup and restore operations.

{% endnote %}

## Creating backups {#size}

You can create backups both automatically and manually making a full backup of all the databases in both cases.

All cluster data is backed up once a day. You can't disable an automatic backup. However, when [creating](../operations/cluster-create.md) or [editing](../operations/update.md#change-additional-settings) a cluster, you can set a start time for these backups. By default, the backup process starts at 22:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). The backup will start within half an hour of the specified time.

After a backup is created, it's compressed for storage. The exact backup size isn't displayed.

Backups are only created on running clusters. If you don't use a {{ mms-short-name }} cluster around the clock, check the [backup start time settings](../operations/update.md#change-additional-settings).

For more information about creating a backup manually, see [{#T}](../operations/cluster-backups.md).

## Storing backups {#storage}

Storing backups in {{ mms-name }}:

* Backups are stored in Yandex internal storage as binary files.

* Automatically created backups of an existing cluster are kept for 7 days whereas those created manually are stored indefinitely. Once you delete a cluster, all its backups persist for 7 days.

* {% include [no-quotes-no-limits](../../_includes/mdb/backups/no-quotes-no-limits.md) %}

* {% include [using-storage](../../_includes/mdb/backups/storage.md) %}

   For more information, see the [Pricing policy for {{ mms-name }}](../pricing/index.md#rules-storage).

## Checking backups {#verify}

### Checking backup integrity {#integrity}

Backup integrity is checked on synthetic data using integration tests available in the service.

### Checking backup recovery {#capabilities}

To test the backup feature, [restore a cluster from a backup](../operations/cluster-backups.md#restore-cluster) and check the integrity of your data.


## Exporting database backups to {{ objstorage-full-name }} and restoring from a backup {#send-to-objstorage}

The service supports exporting database backups to and restoring databases from [{{ objstorage-name }}](../../storage/) buckets. In both the cases, a cluster must have a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts) with bucket access linked to it.

Backups are exported in unencrypted form, which is why we recommend restricting access to the bucket. A backup stored in {{ objstorage-name }} that will be used to restore a database must be unencrypted as well.

For information about exporting a backup to a {{ objstorage-name }} bucket or restoring a database from a backup, see [{#T}](../../managed-sqlserver/operations/cluster-backups.md).
