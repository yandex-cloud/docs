# Connecting to a database in a {{ MS }} cluster

You can connect to {{ mms-short-name }} cluster hosts:

* Over the internet, if you configured public access for the appropriate host. You can only connect to this type of cluster using an [SSL connection](#get-ssl-cert).
* From {{ yandex-cloud }} VM instances hosted in the same [virtual network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md). If the cluster isn't publicly available, you don't need to use an SSL connection to connect to such VMs.

If the cluster consists of multiple hosts, you can connect:

* To the primary replica for read and write operations.
* To secondary replicas for read operations if [readable replicas](../concepts/replication.md#readable-and-non-readable-replicas) were enabled when [creating the cluster](./cluster-create.md) or [afterwards in its additional settings](./update.md#change-additional-settings).

You can connect to a cluster from a single host both for reading and writing.

For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/replication.md).

{% note info %}

If your cluster has public access set up only for certain hosts, automatically switching the primary replica may make it inaccessible over the internet.

## Configuring security groups {#configuring-security-groups}

{% include [sg-rules](../../_includes/mdb/sg-rules-connect.md) %}

Settings of rules depend on the connection method you select:

{% list tabs %}

- Over the internet
   
   [Configure all security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) in the cluster to allow incoming traffic on port {{ port-mms }} from any IP address. To do this, create the following rule for incoming traffic:

   * Port range: `{{ port-mms }}`.
   * Protocol: `TCP`.
   * Source: `CIDR`.
   * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

- With a VM in Yandex.Cloud
   
   1. [Configure all security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) in the cluster to allow incoming traffic from the security group where your VM is located on port {{ port-mms }}. To do this, create the following rule for incoming traffic in these groups:


         * Port range: `{{ port-mms }}`.
         * Protocol: `TCP`.
         * Source: `Security group`.
         * Security group: If your cluster and VM are in the same security group, select `Self` as the value. Otherwise, specify the VM security group.
   
   1. [Configure the security group](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) where the VM is located to allow connections to the VM and traffic between the VM and the cluster hosts.


         Example VM rule:

         * Incoming traffic:
            * Port range: `{{ port-ssh }}`.
            * Protocol: `TCP`.
            * Source: `CIDR`.
            * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

             This rule lets you connect to the VM over SSH.

         * Outgoing traffic:
             * Port range: `{{ port-any }}`.
             * Protocol: `Any`.
             * Destination name: `CIDR`.
             * CIDR blocks: `0.0.0.0/0`.

             This rule allows all outgoing traffic, which lets you both connect to the cluster and install the certificates and utilities that the VMs need to connect to the cluster.

{% endlist %}

{% note info %}

You can set more detailed rules for security groups, such as allowing traffic in only specific subnets.

Security groups must be configured correctly for all subnets that will include cluster hosts. If the security group settings are incomplete or incorrect, you might lose access the cluster.

{% endnote %}

For more information about security groups, see [{#T}](../concepts/network.md#security-groups).

## Getting an SSL certificate {#get-ssl-cert}

To use an encrypted connection, get an SSL certificate:

{% list tabs %}

- Ubuntu 20.04

  {% include [install-certificate](../../_includes/mdb/mms/install-certificate.md) %}

{% endlist %}

{% include [ide-ssl-cert](../../_includes/mdb/mdb-ide-ssl-cert.md) %}

## Connecting to cluster hosts from graphical IDEs {#connection-ide}

{% include [ide-environments](../../_includes/mdb/mdb-ide-envs.md) %}

You can only use graphical IDEs to connect to publicly accessible cluster hosts. Before connecting with DataGrip, [generate a certificate](#get-ssl-cert).

{% list tabs %}

- DataGrip

   1. Create a data source:
      1. Select **File** → **New** → **Data Source** → **Microsoft SQL Server**.
      1. On the **General** tab:
         1. Specify the connection parameters:
            * **Host**: FQDN of the primary replica or a [special FQDN](#special-fqdns).
            * **Port**: `{{ port-mms }}`.
            * **User**, **Password**: DB user's name and password.

## Sample connection strings {#connection-string}

{% include [conn-strings-environment](../../_includes/mdb/mms-conn-strings-env.md) %}

{% include [see-sqdn-in-console](../../_includes/mdb/see-fqdn-in-console.md) %}

{% include [mms-connection-strings](../../_includes/mdb/mms-conn-strings.md) %}

## Special FQDNs {#special-fqdns}

Just like usual FQDNs, which can be requested with a [list of cluster hosts](hosts.md#list), {{ mms-name }} provides a number of special FQDNs, which can also be used when connecting to a cluster.

### Current primary replica {#fqdn-primary-replica}

A FQDN like `c-<cluster ID>.rw.{{ dns-zone }}` always points to a cluster's primary replica. The cluster ID can be requested with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

When connecting to this FQDN, both read and write operations are allowed.

Example connection to a primary replica for a cluster with the ID `c9qash3nb1v9ulc8j9nm`:

```bash
mssql-cli --username <username> \
          --database <database name> \
          --server c-c9qash3nb1v9ulc8j9nm.rw.{{ dns-zone }},1433
```
