# Managing users

You can add and remove users, as well as manage their individual settings.

{% note warning %}

You can use SQL commands to assign privileges to users, but you can't use them to add or change users. For more information, see [{#T}](grant.md).

{% endnote %}

- API

  Use the [list](../api-ref/User/list.md) API method: pass the ID of the required cluster in the `clusterId` request parameter.

  To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

{% endlist %}

        ```hcl
        resource "yandex_mdb_sqlserver_cluster" "<cluster name>" {
          ...
          user {
            name     = "<username>"
            password = "<password>"
          }

- API

  Use the [create](../api-ref/User/create.md) API method and pass the following in the request:

  - ID of the cluster where you want to create a user, in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
  - Username, in the `userSpec.name` parameter.
  - User password, in the `userSpec.password` parameter.

      {% include [username-and-password-limits](../../_includes/mdb/mms/note-info-user-name-and-pass-limits.md) %}

  - One or more databases that the user must have access to, in one or more `userSpec.permissions.databaseName` parameters.

    1. Change the value of the `password` field:

        ```hcl
        resource "yandex_mdb_sqlserver_cluster" "<cluster name>" {
          ...
          user {
            name     = "<username>"
            password = "<password>"
          }

    For more information, see [provider documentation {{ TF }}]({{ tf-provider-mms }}).

- API

  Use the [update](../api-ref/User/update.md) API method and pass the following in the request:

  - In the `clusterId` parameter, the ID of the cluster where the user is located. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

  - New user password, in the `password` parameter.

      {% include [password-limits](../../_includes/mdb/mms/note-info-password-limits.md) %}

  - List of user configuration fields to be changed (in this case, the `password`), in the `updateMask` parameter.

  {% note warning %}

  This API method resets any settings that aren't passed explicitly in the request to their defaults.
  To avoid this, be sure to pass the name of the user password field: `password`, in the `updateMask` parameter.

  {% endnote %}
