# Creating a {{ MS }} cluster

{{ MS }} cluster: one or more database hosts. [Replication](../concepts/replication.md) works by default in any cluster with more than 1 host: the primary replica accepts read and write requests and propagates changes to the secondary replicas at the same time.

{% note info %}

If database storage is 95% full, the cluster switches to read-only mode. Plan and increase the required storage size in advance.

{% endnote %}

{% if audience != "internal" %}

The number of hosts that can be created together with a {{ MS }} cluster depends on the selected [type of storage](../concepts/storage.md):

* With **local SSD** or **non-replicated SSD** storage, you can create a cluster with three or more hosts (a minimum of three hosts is required for fault tolerance).
* With **network HDD** or **network SSD** storage, you can add any number of hosts within the [current quota](../concepts/limits.md).

After creating a cluster, you can add extra hosts to it if there are enough available [folder resources](../concepts/limits.md).

## How to create a {{ MS }} cluster {#create-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ mms-name }}**.
   1. Click **Create cluster**.
   1. Name the cluster in the **Cluster name** field. The cluster name must be unique within the folder.
   1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you can't change the environment once the cluster is created):
      * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
      * `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mms-short-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.
  1. Select the DBMS version. Currently, we support the following versions: {{ versions.console.str }}.

      For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/index.md).

   1. Select the host class to define the technical specifications of the VMs where the database hosts will be deployed. All available options are listed in [{#T}](../concepts/instance-types.md). When you change the host class for the cluster, the characteristics of all existing hosts change, too.
   1. Under **Storage size**:

      {% if audience != "internal" %}

      * Select the [storage type](../concepts/storage.md).

         {% include [storages-step-settings](../../_includes/mdb/settings-storages-no-broadwell.md) %}

      {% endif %}

      * Select the size to be used for data and backups. For more information about how backups take up storage space, see [{#T}](../concepts/backup.md).
   1. Under **Database**, specify the database attributes:

      * Database name. This name must be unique within the folder and contain only Latin letters, numbers, and underscores.
      * Username of the database owner. This name may only contain Latin letters, numbers, and underscores. By default, the new user is assigned 50 connections to each host in the cluster.
      * User password (from 8 to 128 characters).

   1. Under **Network settings**, select the cloud network to host the cluster in and security groups for cluster network traffic. You may also need to [set up security groups](connect.md#configuring-security-groups) to connect to the cluster.

   1. Under **Hosts**:

      1. Select the database host parameters for databases being created alongside the cluster. By default, each host is created in a separate subnet. To select a specific subnet for a host, click ![image](../../_assets/pencil.svg) in the host's row and select the desired availability zone and subnet.

         {% note warning %}

         The number of hosts available to be added depends on the SQL Server [edition](../concepts/index.md):

         * In the **Standard Edition**, you can only create a single-host cluster. This cluster does not provide any fault tolerance.
         * In the **Enterprise Edition**, you can create clusters of either one or three of more hosts. If you selected `local-ssd` or `network-ssd-nonreplicated` under **Storage**, you need to add at least 3 hosts to the cluster.

         {% endnote %}

      {% if audience != "internal" %}

      1. (Optional) Select groups of [dedicated hosts](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md) to host the cluster on.

         {% include [Dedicated hosts note](../../_includes/mdb/mms/note-dedicated-hosts.md) %}

      {% endif %}

   1. If necessary, configure additional cluster settings:

      {% include [extra-settings-create](../../_includes/mdb/mms/extra-settings-create.md) %}

   1. If necessary, configure the [DBMS settings](../concepts/settings-list.md).
   1. Click **Create cluster**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To create a cluster:

   {% if audience != "internal" %}

   1. Check whether the folder has any subnets for the cluster hosts:

      ```bash
      yc vpc subnet list
      ```

      If there are no subnets in the folder, [create the necessary subnets](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) in {{ vpc-short-name }}.

   {% endif %}

   1. View a description of the CLI's create cluster command:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-ms }} cluster create --help
      ```

   1. Specify cluster parameters in the create command (the list of supported parameters in the example is not exhaustive):

      {% if audience != "internal" %}

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-ms }} cluster create <cluster name> \
         --sqlserver-version=<{{ MS }} version> \

## Examples {#examples}

### Creating a single-host cluster

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   To create a cluster with a single host, pass a single `--host` parameter.

   Let's say we need to create a {{ MS }} cluster with the following characteristics:

   {% if audience != "internal" %}

   * `mssql-1` as the name.
   * Version `2016 SP2 Standard Edition`.
   * In the `PRODUCTION` environment.
   * In the `default` network.
   * In the security group `{{ security-group }}`.
   * With a single class `s2.small` host in a subnet called `b0cd5bv7pfpr7r900tkp` in the `{{ zone-id }}` availability zone.
   * With 10 GB of SSD network storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`).
   * With one user, `user1`, with the password `user1user1`.
   * With one database, `db1`.
   * With protection against accidental cluster deletion.

   {% else %}

   * `mssql-1` as the name.
   * Version `2016 SP2 Standard Edition`
   * In the `PRODUCTION` environment.
   * In the security group `{{ security-group }}`.
   * With a single `db1.micro` class host in the `man` availability zone.
   * With 20 GB fast local storage (`local-ssd`).
   * With one user, `user1`, with the password `user1user1`.
   * With one database, `db1`.
   * With protection against accidental cluster deletion.

   {% endif %}

   Run the command:

   {% if audience != "internal" %}

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-ms }} cluster create \
      --name=mssql-1 \
      --sqlserver-version=2016sp2std \
      --environment=PRODUCTION \
      --network-name=default \
      --resource-preset=s2.small \
      --host zone-id={{ zone-id }},`
            `subnet-id=b0cd5bv7pfpr7r900tkp \
      --disk-type={{ disk-type-example }} \
      --disk-size=20 \
      --user name=user1,`
            `password=user1user1 \
      --database name=db1 \
      --security-group-ids={{ security-group }} \
      --deletion-protection=true
   ```

   {% else %}

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-ms }} cluster create \
      --name=mssql-1 \
      --sqlserver-version=2016sp2std \
      --environment=PRODUCTION \
      --network-id=' ' \
      --host zone-id=man \
      --resource-preset=db1.micro \
      --disk-type=local-ssd \
      --disk-size=20 \
      --user name=user1,`
            `password=user1user1 \
      --database name=db1 \
      --security-group-ids={{ security-group }}
   ```

   {% endif %}

- Terraform

   Let's say we need to create a {{ MS }} cluster and a network for it with the following characteristics:

    * `mssql-1` as the name.
    * In the `PRODUCTION` environment.
    * Using the {{ MS }} `{{ versions.tf.latest.long-std }}`.
    * In the cloud with the ID `{{ tf-cloud-id }}`.
    * In the folder with the ID `{{ tf-folder-id }}`.
    * In the new `mynet` network.
    * In a new security group called `ms-sql-sg` allowing cluster connections from the Internet via port `{{ port-mms }}`.
    * With a single host of the `s2.small` class on a new `mysubnet` subnet and the `{{ zone-id }}` availability zone. The `mysubnet` subnet will have a range of `10.5.0.0/24`.
    * With 32 GB of network SSD storage.
    * With a database called `db1`.
    * With a user with `user1` as the login and `user1user1` as the password. This user will own the `db1` database ([predefined role `DB_OWNER`](./grant.md#predefined-db-roles)).
    * With protection against accidental cluster deletion.

   The configuration file for the cluster looks like this:
