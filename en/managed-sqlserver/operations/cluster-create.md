# Creating a {{ MS }} cluster

{{ MS }} cluster: one or more database hosts. [Replication](../concepts/replication.md) works by default in any cluster with more than 1 host: the primary replica accepts read and write requests and propagates changes to the secondary replicas at the same time.

{% note info %}

If database storage is 95% full, the cluster switches to read-only mode. Plan and increase the required storage size in advance.

{% endnote %}


The number of hosts that can be created together with a {{ MS }} cluster depends on the selected [type of storage](../concepts/storage.md):

* With **local storage**, you can create a cluster with 3 or more hosts (to ensure fault tolerance, a minimum of 3 hosts is necessary).
* When using network storage:
    * If you select **standard** or **fast network storage**, you can add any number of hosts within the [current quota](../concepts/limits.md).
    * If you select **non-replicated network storage**, you can create a cluster with 3 or more hosts (to ensure fault tolerance, a minimum of 3 hosts is necessary).

After creating a cluster, you can add extra hosts to it if there are enough available [folder resources](../concepts/limits.md).

## How to create a {{ MS }} cluster {#create-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mms-name }}**.

  1. Click **Create cluster**.

  1. Enter a name for the cluster in the **Cluster name** field. The cluster name must be unique within the folder.

  1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you can't change the environment once the cluster is created):
      - `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
      - `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mms-short-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.

  1. Select the DBMS version. Currently, we support `2016 ServicePack 2` of the following editions:
     * Standard Edition.
     * Enterprise Edition.

     For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/index.md).

  1. Select the host class to define the technical specifications of the VMs where the database hosts will be deployed. All available options are listed in [{#T}](../concepts/instance-types.md). When you change the host class for the cluster, the characteristics of all existing hosts change, too.

  1. Under **Storage size**:

      
      - Choose the [type of storage](../concepts/storage.md), either a more flexible network type (`network-hdd`, `network-ssd`, or `network-ssd-nonreplicated`) or faster local SSD storage (`local-ssd`).

        When selecting a storage type, remember that:
        - The size of the local storage can only be changed in 100 GB increments.
        - The size of non-replicated network storage can only be changed in 93 GB increments.
      - Select the size to be used for data and backups. For more information about how backups take up storage space, see [{#T}](../concepts/backup.md).

  1. Under **Database**, specify the database attributes:
      - Database name. This name must be unique within the folder and contain only Latin letters, numbers, and underscores.
      - Username of the database owner. This name may only contain Latin letters, numbers, and underscores. By default, the new user is assigned 50 connections to each host in the cluster.
      - User password (from 8 to 128 characters).

  1. Under **Hosts**, select the parameters for the database hosts created with the cluster. You can add either one, three, or more hosts. By default, each host is created in a separate subnet. To select a specific subnet for the host, click ![image](../../_assets/pencil.svg) in the row of the host and select the desired availability zone and subnet.

     {% note warning %}
     * If you select **Standard Edition**, you can create a cluster from only one host. This cluster does not provide any fault tolerance. For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/index.md).
     * At the moment, you can create an **Enterprise Edition** cluster with either one or three hosts. Please note that if you selected `local-ssd` or `network-ssd-nonreplicated` under **Storage**, you need to add at least 3 hosts to the cluster.

     {% endnote %}

  1. If necessary, configure additional cluster settings:

      {% include [extra-settings-create](../../_includes/mdb/mms/extra-settings-create.md) %}

  1. If necessary, configure the [DBMS settings](../concepts/settings-list.md).

  1. Click **Create cluster**.

- Terraform

    {% include [terraform-definition](../../_includes/solutions/terraform-definition.md) %}

    If you don't have {{ TF }}, [install it and configure the provider](../../solutions/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

    To create a cluster:

    1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:
        - Database cluster: Description of the cluster and its hosts. If required, here you can also configure [DBMS settings](../concepts/settings-list.md#dbms-cluster-settings).
        - Network: Description of the [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) where the cluster will be located. If you already have a suitable network, you don't need to describe it again.
        - Subnets: Description of the [subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) to connect the cluster hosts to. If you already have suitable subnets, you don't need to describe them again.

        Example configuration file structure:

        ```hcl
        resource "yandex_mdb_sqlserver_cluster" "<cluster name>" {
          name                = "<cluster name>"
          environment         = "<environment: PRESTABLE or PRODUCTION>"
          network_id          = "<network ID>"
          version             = "<version: 2016sp2std or 2016sp2ent>"
          security_groups_id  = ["<list of security group IDs>"]
          deletion_protection = <protect cluster from deletion: true or false>
        
          resources {
            resource_preset_id = "<host class>"
            disk_type_id       = "<storage type>"
            disk_size          = <storage size in GB>
          }

            subnet_id = "<subnet ID>"
          }
        
          database = {
            name = "<database name>"
          }
        
          user {
            name     = "<username>"
            password = "<password>"
        
            permission {
              database_name = "<database name>"
              roles         = ["<list of roles>"]
            }
          }
        
          backup_window_start {
            hours   = <backup starting hour>
            minutes = <backup starting minute>
          }
        }
        
        resource "yandex_vpc_network" "<network name>" { name = "<network name>" }
        
        resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "<subnet name>" {
          name           = "<subnet name>"
          zone           = "<availability zone>"
          network_id     = "<network ID>"
          v4_cidr_blocks = ["<range>"]
        }
        ```

       {% include [deletion-protection-limits-db](../../_includes/mdb/deletion-protection-limits-db.md) %}

       For more information about the resources you can create using {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-mms }}).

    1. Make sure the settings are correct.

## Examples {#examples}

### Creating a single-host cluster

{% list tabs %}

- Terraform

    Let's say we need to create a {{ MS }} cluster and a network for it with the following characteristics:
    - Using `mssql-1` as the name.
    - In the `PRODUCTION` environment.
    - Using the {{ MS }} `2016 ServicePack 2` version and the `Standard Edition`.
    - In the cloud with the ID `{{ tf-cloud-id }}`.
    - In the folder with the ID `{{ tf-folder-id }}`.
    - Network: `mynet`.
    - In a new security group called `ms-sql-sg` supporting cluster connections from the internet via port `{{ port-mms }}`.
    - With a single host of the `s2.small` class in a new `mysubnet` subnet and the `{{ zone-id }}` availability zone. The `mysubnet` subnet will have a range of `10.5.0.0/24`.
    - With 32Â GB of fast network storage.
    - With a database called `db1`.
    - With a user with `user1` as the login and `user1user1` as the password. This user will own the `db1` database ([predefined role `DB_OWNER`](./grant.md#predefined-db-roles)).
    - With protection against accidental cluster deletion.

    The configuration file for the cluster looks like this:

    ```hcl
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        yandex = {
          source = "yandex-cloud/yandex"

      }
    
      host {

      user {
        name     = "user1"
        password = "user1user1"
        permission {
          database_name = "db1"
          roles         = ["OWNER"]
        }
      }
    }
    
    resource "yandex_vpc_network" "mynet" { name = "mynet" }
    
    resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "mysubnet" {

      v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.5.0.0/24"]
    }
    
    resource "yandex_vpc_security_group" "ms-sql-sg" {
      name       = "ms-sql-sg"
      network_id = yandex_vpc_network.mynet.id
    
      ingress {
        description    = "Public access to SQL Server"
        port           = {{ port-mms }}
        protocol       = "TCP"
        v4_cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
