# Creating a {{ MS }} cluster

{{ MS }} cluster: one or more database hosts. [Replication](../concepts/replication.md) works by default in any cluster with more than 1 host: the primary replica accepts read and write requests and propagates changes to the secondary replicas at the same time.

{% note info %}

* The number of hosts you can create together with a {{ MS }} cluster depends on the selected [storage type](../concepts/storage.md#storage-type-selection) and [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md#available-flavors).
* Available storage types [depend](../concepts/storage.md) on the selected [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md#available-flavors).

{% endnote %}

If database storage is 95% full, the cluster switches to read-only mode. Plan and increase the required storage size in advance.

## How to create a {{ MS }} cluster {#create-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ mms-name }}**.
   1. Click **Create cluster**.
   1. Name the cluster in the **Cluster name** field. The cluster name must be unique within the folder.
   1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you can't change the environment once the cluster is created):
      * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
      * `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mms-short-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.
   1. Select the DBMS version. The following editions are available for all supported versions:
      * Standard Edition.
      * Enterprise Edition.

      For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/index.md).

   1. Select the host class to define the technical specifications of the VMs where the database hosts will be deployed. All available options are listed in [{#T}](../concepts/instance-types.md). When you change the host class for the cluster, the characteristics of all existing hosts change, too.
   1. Under **Storage size**:

      
      * Select the [storage type](../concepts/storage.md).

         {% include [storages-step-settings](../../_includes/mdb/settings-storages-no-broadwell.md) %}


      * Select the size to be used for data and backups. For more information about how backups take up storage space, see [{#T}](../concepts/backup.md).
   1. Under **Database**, specify the database attributes:

      * Database name. This name must be unique within the folder and contain only Latin letters, numbers, and underscores.
      * Username of the database owner. This name may only contain Latin letters, numbers, and underscores. By default, the new user is assigned 50 connections to each host in the cluster.
      * User password (from 8 to 128 characters).

   1. Under **Network settings**, select the cloud network to host the cluster in and security groups for cluster network traffic. You may also need to [set up security groups](connect.md#configuring-security-groups) to connect to the cluster.

   1. Under **Hosts**:

      1. Select database host parameters for the databases being created alongside the cluster. By default, each host is created in a separate subnet. To select a specific subnet for a host, click ![image](../../_assets/pencil.svg) in the host's row and select the required availability zone and subnet.

         The number of hosts available to be added depends on the SQL Server [edition](../concepts/index.md):

         * In the **Standard Edition**, you can create a cluster of one or two hosts:

            * A single-host cluster is not fault tolerant.
            * A two-host cluster is fault-tolerant. An additional third witness host is automatically created for it and includes the minimum required resources and a Windows Standard license. This is taken into account in the cost calculation.

         * In the **Enterprise Edition**, you are able to create a cluster of one or more hosts:

            * A single-host cluster is not fault tolerant.
            * A cluster of two or more hosts is fault tolerant. An additional third witness host is created for a two-host cluster. It includes the minimum required resources and a Windows Standard license. This is taken into account in the cost calculation.
            * If you selected `local-ssd` or `network-ssd-nonreplicated` under **Storage**, you need to add at least 3 hosts to the cluster.

      
      1. (Optional) Select groups of [dedicated hosts](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md) to host the cluster on.

         {% include [Dedicated hosts note](../../_includes/mdb/mms/note-dedicated-hosts.md) %}


   1. If necessary, configure additional cluster settings:

      {% include [extra-settings-create](../../_includes/mdb/mms/extra-settings-create.md) %}

   1. If necessary, configure the [DBMS settings](../concepts/settings-list.md).
   1. Click **Create cluster**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To create a cluster:

   
   1. Check whether the folder has any subnets for the cluster hosts:

      ```bash
      yc vpc subnet list
      ```

      If there are no subnets in the folder, [create the necessary subnets](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) in {{ vpc-short-name }}.


   1. View a description of the CLI's create cluster command:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-ms }} cluster create --help
      ```

   1. Specify cluster parameters in the create command (the list of supported parameters in the example is not exhaustive):

      
      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-ms }} cluster create <cluster name> \
         --sqlserver-version=<{{ MS }} version:{{ versions.cli.str }}> \
         --environment=<environment: PRESTABLE or PRODUCTION> \
         --host zone-id=<availability zone>,`
               `subnet-id=<subnet ID>,`
               `assign-public-ip=<host access via public IP: true or false> \
         --network-name=<network name> \
         --user name=<username>,`
               `password=<user password> \

         --deletion-protection=<cluster deletion protection: true or false>
      ```

      {% note info %}

## Examples {#examples}

### Creating a single-host cluster

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   To create a cluster with a single host, pass a single `--host` parameter.

   Create a {{ mms-name }} cluster with test characteristics:

   
   * Named `mssql-1`.
   * Versions `{{ versions.cli.latest.long-std }}`.
   * In the `PRODUCTION` environment.
   * In the `default` network.
   * In the security group `{{ security-group }}`.
   * With a single `s2.small` class host in the new `b0cd5bv7pfpr7r900tkp` subnet, in the `{{ region-id }}-a` availability zone.
   * With a network SSD storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`) of 20 GB.
   * With one user, `user1`, with the password `user1user1`.
   * With one database, `db1`.
   * With protection against accidental cluster deletion.


   Run the following command:

   
   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-ms }} cluster create \
      --name=mssql-1 \
      --sqlserver-version={{ versions.cli.latest.std }} \
      --environment=PRODUCTION \
      --network-name=default \
      --resource-preset=s2.small \
      --host zone-id={{ region-id }}-a,`
            `subnet-id=b0cd5bv7pfpr7r900tkp \
      --disk-type={{ disk-type-example }} \
      --disk-size=20 \
      --user name=user1,`
            `password=user1user1 \
      --database name=db1 \
      --security-group-ids={{ security-group }} \
      --deletion-protection=true
   ```


- {{ TF }}

   Create a {{ mms-name }} cluster and a network for it with test characteristics:

   * Named `mssql-1`.
   * In the `PRODUCTION` environment.
   * With {{ MS }} version `{{ versions.tf.latest.long-std }}`.
   * In the cloud with the ID `{{ tf-cloud-id }}`.
   * In the folder with the ID `{{ tf-folder-id }}`.
   * In the new `mynet` network.
   * In a new security group called `ms-sql-sg` allowing cluster connections from the internet via port `{{ port-mms }}`.
   * With a single `s2.small` class host in the new `mysubnet` subnet, in the `{{ region-id }}-a` availability zone. The `mysubnet` subnet will have a range of `10.5.0.0/24`.
   * With 32 GB of network SSD storage.
   * With a database called `db1`.
   * With the user `user1` and `user1user1` as the password. This user will be the owner of the `db1` database ([predefined role `DB_OWNER`](./grant.md#predefined-db-roles)).
   * With protection against accidental cluster deletion.

   The configuration file for the cluster looks like this:
