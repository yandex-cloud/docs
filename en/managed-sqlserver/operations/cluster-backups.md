# Managing backups

You can create [backups](../concepts/backup.md) and restore clusters from existing backups.

## Getting a list of backups {#list-backups}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  To get a list of cluster backups:
  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mms-name }}**.
  1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and select the tab **Backup copies**.

  {% if audience != "external" %}

  To get a list of backups for all the **{{ mms-name }}** clusters in a folder:
  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mms-name }}**.
  1. Click the **Backups** tab.

{% endif %}

- API

  To get a list of cluster backups, use the [listBackups](../api-ref/Cluster/listBackups.md) API method and pass the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter.

  To get a list of backups for all the **{{ mms-name }}** clusters in the folder, use the [list](../api-ref/Backup/list.md) API method and pass the folder ID in the `folderId` request parameter.

  To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

{% endlist %}

## Getting information about backups {#get-backup}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  To get information about the backup of an existing cluster:
  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mms-name }}**.
  1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and select the tab **Backup copies**.

{% if audience != "external" %}

  To get information about the backup of a previously deleted cluster:

  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mms-name }}**.
  1. Click the **Backups** tab.

{% endif %}

- API

  To get information about a backup, use the [get](../api-ref/Backup/get.md) API method and pass the backup ID in the `backupId` request parameter. To find out the ID, [get a list of backups](#list-backups).

{% endlist %}

## Creating backups {#create-backup}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console
  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mms-name }}**.
  1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and select the tab **Backup copies**.
  1. Click **Create a backup**.

  **{{ mms-name }}** launches the operation to create a backup.

- API

  Use the [backup](../api-ref/Cluster/backup.md) API method and pass the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter.

  To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

{% endlist %}

## Restoring clusters from backups {#restore}

When you restore a cluster from a backup, you create a new cluster with the data from the backup. If the folder has insufficient [resources](../concepts/limits.md) to create such a cluster, you will not be able to restore from the backup.

For a new cluster, you need to set up all its [parameters required at creation](cluster-create.md#create-cluster).

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  To restore an existing cluster from a backup:
  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mms-name }}**.
  1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and select the tab **Backup copies**.
  1. Click ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) for the backup and click **Restore cluster**.
  1. Set up the new cluster. You can select a folder for the new cluster from the **Folder** list.
  1. Click **Restore cluster**.

  {% if audience != "external" %}

  To restore a previously deleted cluster from a backup:
  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mms-name }}**.
  1. Click the **Backups** tab.
  1. Find the desired backup using the backup creation time and cluster ID. The **Name** column contains the IDs in `<cluster ID>:<backup ID>` format.
  1. Click ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) for the backup and click **Restore cluster**.
  1. Set up the new cluster. You can select a folder for the new cluster from the **Folder** list.
  1. Click **Restore cluster**.

  {% endif %}

  **{{ mms-name }}** launches the operation to create a cluster from a backup.

- API

  Use the [restore](../api-ref/Cluster/restore.md) API method and pass the following in the request:
  - ID of the desired backup, in the `backupId` parameter. To find out the ID, [get a list of backups](#list-backups).
  - Timestamp of the moment to which the cluster should be restored, in the `time` parameter.
  - The name of the new cluster that will contain the data recovered from the backup. The cluster name must be unique within the folder.

{% endlist %}

## Editing the backup start time {#set-backup-window}

{% list tabs %}

{% if audience != "external" %}

- Management console
  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mms-name }}**.
  1. Select the cluster and click **Edit cluster** in the top panel.
  1. Set the backup start time.
  1. Click **Save changes**.

{% endif %}

- API

  To change the backup start time for a cluster, use the [update](../api-ref/Cluster/update.md) method and pass the following in the request:
  - The cluster ID, in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
  - The new backup start time, in the `configSpec.backupWindowStart` parameter.
  - List of cluster configuration fields to be changed (in this case, `configSpec.backupWindowStart`), in the `updateMask` parameter.

  {% note warning %}

  This API method resets any cluster settings that aren't passed explicitly in the request to their defaults. To avoid this, in the `updateMask` parameter, list the settings you want to change (in a single line, separated by commas).

  {% endnote %}
