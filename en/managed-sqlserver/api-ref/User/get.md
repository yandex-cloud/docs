Field | Description
--- | ---
name | **string**<br><p>Name of the SQL Server user.</p> 
clusterId | **string**<br><p>ID of the SQL Server cluster the user belongs to.</p> 
permissions[] | **object**<br><p>Set of permissions granted to the user.</p> 
permissions[].<br>databaseName | **string**<br><p>Name of the database the permission grants access to.</p> 
permissions[].<br>roles[] | **string**<br><p>Required. Roles granted to the user within the database.</p> <p>The minimum number of elements is 1.</p> <ul> <li>DB_OWNER: Members of this fixed database role can perform all configuration and maintenance activities on a database and can also drop a database in SQL Server.</li> <li>DB_SECURITYADMIN: Members of this fixed database role can modify role membership for custom roles only and manage permissions. They can potentially elevate their privileges and their actions should be monitored.</li> <li>DB_ACCESSADMIN: Members of this fixed database role can add or remove access to a database for Windows logins, Windows groups, and SQL Server logins.</li> <li>DB_BACKUPOPERATOR: Members of this fixed database role can back up the database.</li> <li>DB_DDLADMIN: Members of this fixed database role can run any Data Definition Language (DDL) command in a database.</li> <li>DB_DATAWRITER: Members of this fixed database role can add, delete, or change data in all user tables.</li> <li>DB_DATAREADER: Members of this fixed database role can read all data from all user tables.</li> <li>DB_DENYDATAWRITER: Members of this fixed database role cannot add, modify, or delete any data in the user tables within a database. A denial has a higher priority than a grant, so you can use this role to quickly restrict one's privileges without explicitly revoking permissions or roles.</li> <li>DB_DENYDATAREADER: Members of this fixed database role cannot read any data in the user tables within a database. A denial has a higher priority than a grant, so you can use this role to quickly restrict one's privileges without explicitly revoking permissions or roles.</li> </ul> 
serverRoles[] | **string**<br><p>Set of server roles granted to the login.</p> <ul> <li> <p>MDB_MONITOR: Effectively grants VIEW SERVER STATE to the login.</p> <p>That gives an ability to use various dynamic management views to monitor server state, including Activity Monitor tool that is built-in into SSMS.</p> <p>No intrusive actions are allowed, so this is pretty safe to grant.</p> </li> </ul>
