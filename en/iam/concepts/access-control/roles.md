# Roles

_A role_ is a set of user permissions to perform operations with {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

There are two types of roles:

- _Primitive roles_ contain permissions that apply to all types of {{ yandex-cloud }} resources. These are roles like `{{ roles-admin }}`, `{{ roles-editor }}`, and `{{ roles-viewer }}`.

- _Service roles_ contain permissions only for a specific type of resource in a particular service. Service role ID is specified in `service.resources.role` format. For example, the `{{ roles-image-user }}` role lets you use images in Yandex Compute Cloud.

    A service role can be assigned to the resource that the role is intended for or the resource that permissions are inherited from. For example, you can assign the `{{ roles-image-user }}` role for a folder or cloud, because images inherit permissions from them.

Currently, users aren't allowed to create new roles with a custom set of permissions.

## Primitive roles {#primitive-roles}

### {{ roles-viewer }} {#viewer}

The `{{ roles-viewer }}` role grants permission to read resources.

For example, the `{{ roles-viewer }}` role lets you perform the following operations:

- View information about a resource.
- Get a list of nested resources, such as a list of VMs in a folder.
- View a list of operations with a resource.

### {{ roles-editor }} {#editor}

The `{{ roles-editor }}` role grants permissions to perform any operation related to resource management, except assigning roles to other users. The `{{ roles-editor }}` role includes all permissions granted by the `{{ roles-viewer }}` role.

For example, the `{{ roles-editor }}` role lets you perform the following operations:

- Create a resource.
- Update a resource.
- Delete a resource.

### {{ roles-admin }} {#admin}

The `{{ roles-admin }}` role grants all permissions to manage the resource, including assigning roles to other users. You can assign any role except `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}`.

The `{{ roles-admin }}` role includes all permissions granted by the `{{ roles-editor }}` role.

For example, the `{{ roles-admin }}` role lets you perform the following operations:

- Set permissions to the resource.
- Change permissions to the resource.
