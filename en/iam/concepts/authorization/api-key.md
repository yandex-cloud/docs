# API key

_The API key_ is a private key used for simplified authorization in the Yandex.Cloud API. API keys are only used for [service accounts](../users/service-accounts.md).

{% include [api-keys-disclaimer](../../../_includes/iam/api-keys-disclaimer.md) %}

{% note alert %}

If someone might have gotten access to your private key, [delete it](../../operations/api-key/delete.md) and [create a new one](../../operations/api-key/create.md).

{% endnote %}
