# API key

The _API key_ is a secret key used for simplified authorization in the {{ yandex-cloud }} API. API keys are only used for [service accounts](../users/service-accounts.md).

{% include [api-keys-disclaimer](../../../_includes/iam/api-keys-disclaimer.md) %}

{% note alert %}

If someone might have gotten access to your private key, [delete it](../../operations/api-key/delete.md) and [create a new one](../../operations/api-key/create.md).

{% endnote %}

The key is stored by the user. {{ yandex-cloud }} gives access to it only when the API key is created.
If the key is lost or damaged, you can't restore it. In this case, you can [reissue](../../operations/compromised-credentials.md#api-key-reissue) the key or create a new one.

## Using the token {#use}

Enter the API key when accessing {{ yandex-cloud }} resources via the API. Pass the API key in the `Authorization` header in the following format:

```
Authorization: Api-Key <API key>
```
