# Static access keys compatible with the Amazon AWS API

_Static access keys_ consist of a private key and a key ID used for authentication in services with an AWS-compatible API, such as {{ objstorage-name }} and {{ message-queue-name }}. Access keys are only used for [service accounts](../users/service-accounts.md).

Users sign their requests with private keys. Yandex.Cloud finds the key with the specified ID and uses it to verify the received signature. The fact that a private key is linked to a service account ensures that an operation is performed by the account owner.
