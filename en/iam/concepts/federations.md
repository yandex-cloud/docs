# Identity federations

Using [{{ org-full-name }}](../../organization/), you can configure Single Sign-On authentication in {{ yandex-cloud }} through your Identity Provider, such as Active Directory or Google Workspace.

This authentication approach is called an identity federation: company employees use their corporate accounts and only authenticate in the corporate authentication system. To access resources in {{ yandex-cloud }}, they don't need Yandex ID accounts.

For operations within an identity federation, the Identity Provider must support the SAML 2.0 standard.
