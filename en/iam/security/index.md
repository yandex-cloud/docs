# Access management in {{ iam-name }}

In this section, you will learn:
* [Which resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#choosing-roles) for particular actions.

## Which resources you can assign roles to {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

## Which roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

The chart below shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. For example, the `editor` role includes all `viewer` role permissions. You can find the description of each role under the chart.

### Service roles {#service-roles}

{% include [roles-sa-user](../../_includes/roles-sa-user.md) %}

For some services, you need a service account to perform operations, such as in [{{ ig-name }}](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/index.md) or [{{ managed-k8s-name }}]({{ link-cloud-services }}/managed-kubernetes). If you specified a service account in the request, {{ iam-short-name }} will check you have permissions to use this account.

## What roles do I need {#choosing-roles}

The table below lists the roles needed to perform a particular action. You can always assign a role granting more permissions than the role specified. For example, you can assign the `editor` role instead of the `viewer` one.
