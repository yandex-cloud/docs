# Getting started with {{ iam-short-name }}

{{ iam-short-name }} lets you manage access to {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

Follow these instructions to add a user to an [organization](../organization/) and grant them access to a resource in one of your [clouds](../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud).

These instructions require the following [roles](./concepts/access-control/roles.md):

* Organization owner (`organization-manager.organizations.owner`) or administrator (`organization-manager.admin`).
* Cloud owner (`resource-manager.clouds.owner`) or administrator (`admin`).


## Getting started {#before-you-begin}


1. Log in to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). If you aren't registered, go to the management console and follow the instructions.
1. [On the billing page]({{ link-console-billing }}), make sure you have a [billing account](../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) linked and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you do not yet have a billing account, [create one](../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. If you don't have anyone to add to the cloud, you can [create a new account](https://passport.yandex.com/registration) on Yandex and grant this account access to the cloud.



## Add a user to your organization {#add-organization-member}

You can add a user with a Yandex account or a [federated](../organization/add-federation.md) user.

To add a user with a Yandex account:

{% include [add-useraccount](../_includes/organization/add-useraccount.md) %}

{% note info %}

You can also invite users to your organization directly, from your cloud page in the management console. For more, see the [instructions](./operations/users/create.md#add-useraccount).

{% endnote %}

To grant a user access to a cloud resource, assign the user a role to the resource itself or to a resource container, such as a folder.


## Assign roles to the user {#assign-role}

To specify which operations the user can perform, assign relevant roles to the user. For example, allow the user to view cloud resources and manage a folder:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Assign the user a role in the cloud:

      {% include [set-accessbinding-user-editor-folder-console](../_includes/resource-manager/set-accessbinding-user-viewer-cloud-console.md) %}

   1. Assign the user a role in the folder:

      {% include [set-accessbinding-user-editor-folder-console](../_includes/resource-manager/set-accessbinding-user-editor-folder-console.md) %}

{% endlist %}


## Revoke assigned roles {#revoke-roles}

If the user no longer needs the assigned roles, revoke them:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   * To revoke a role only in the folder:

      {% include [update-access-binding-user-console-folder](../_includes/resource-manager/update-access-binding-user-console-folder.md) %}

   * To revoke a role in the cloud:

      {% include [update-access-binding-user-console-cloud](../_includes/resource-manager/update-access-binding-user-console-cloud.md) %}

{% endlist %}
