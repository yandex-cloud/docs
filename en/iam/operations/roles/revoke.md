# Revoke a role for a resource

If you want to prevent a [subject](../../concepts/access-control/index.md#subject) from accessing a resource, revoke the relevant roles for this resource and for resources that grant inherited access rights. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/access-control/index.md).

{% note info %}

If you need to temporarily revoke all access rights from a user with a {% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}Yandex{% endif %}{% if product == "cloud-il" %}Google{% endif %} account, you can revoke just the `{{ roles-cloud-member }}` role. Although the user keeps all the other roles, they can't perform any operations with the cloud resources. When you add the user to the cloud again, the access rights will already be configured.

{% endnote %}

## Revoking a role {#revoke-one-role}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   In the management console, you can only revoke a cloud or folder role:

   * To revoke a role only in the folder:

      1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to Billing.
      1. Go to **Access rights**.
      1. Select a user from the list and click ![image](../../../_assets/options.svg) next to the username.
      1. Click **Edit roles**.
      1. Click ![image](../../../_assets/cross.svg) next to the role you wish to revoke.
      1. Click **Save**.

   * To revoke a role in the cloud:

      1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), [select](../../../resource-manager/operations/cloud/switch-cloud.md) the cloud.
      1. Go to **Access rights**.
      1. Select a user from the list and click ![image](../../../_assets/options.svg) next to the username.
      1. If you want to revoke all of the user's roles in the cloud, click **Revoke roles** and confirm the revocation.
      1. If you want to revoke individual roles in the cloud:
         1. Click **Edit roles**.
         1. In the **Configure access rights** window, click ![image](../../../_assets/cross.svg) next to each role you want to revoke.
         1. Click **Save**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   To revoke a role from a subject, delete the corresponding access binding for the appropriate resource:

   1. View roles and their assignees:

      {% include [include](../../../_includes/iam/list-access-bindings-via-cli.md) %}

   1. To delete an access binding, run:

      ```bash
      yc <service-name> <resource> remove-access-binding <resource-name>|<resource-id> \
        --role <role-id> \
        --subject <subject-type>:<subject-id>
      ```

      Where:
      * `<role-id>`: The ID of the role to revoke (such as `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}`).
      * `<subject-type>`: The [subject](../../concepts/access-control/index.md#subject) type to revoke a role from.
      * `<subject-id>`: The subject ID.

- API

   To revoke a resource role from a subject, delete the corresponding access binding:

   1. {% include [include](../../../_includes/iam/list-access-bindings-via-api.md) %}
   1. Create a request body, for example, in a `body.json` file. In the request body, specify which access binding to delete. For example, revoke the `editor` role from user `ajei8n54hmfhuk5nog0g`:
{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

      **body.json:**
      ```json
      {
          "accessBindingDeltas": [{
              "action": "REMOVE",
              "accessBinding": {
                  "roleId": "editor",
                  "subject": {
                      "id": "ajei8n54hmfhuk5nog0g",
                      "type": "userAccount"
                      }
                  }
              }
          ]
      }
      ```

{% endif %}
{% if product == "cloud-il" %}

      **body.json:**
      ```json
      {
          "accessBindingDeltas": [{
              "action": "REMOVE",
              "accessBinding": {
                  "roleId": "editor",
                  "subject": {
                      "id": "ajei8n54hmfhuk5nog0g",
                      "type": "federatedUser"
                      }
                  }
              }
          ]
      }
      ```

{% endif %}
   1. Revoke the role by deleting the specified access binding:

   {% include [grant-role-folder-via-curl](../../../_includes/iam/grant-role-folder-via-curl.md) %}

- {{ TF }}

    If you don't have {{ TF }}, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

    1. To revoke a resource role from a subject, find the resource description in the configuration file:

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

        ```
        resource "yandex_resourcemanager_cloud_iam_binding" "admin" {
            cloud_id    = "<cloud ID>"
            role        = "<role>"
            members     = [
            "serviceAccount:<service account ID>",
            "userAccount:<user ID>",
            ]
        }
        ```

{% endif %}
{% if product == "cloud-il" %}

        ```
        resource "yandex_resourcemanager_cloud_iam_binding" "admin" {
            cloud_id    = "<cloud ID>"
            role        = "<role>"
            members     = [
            "serviceAccount:<service account ID>",
            "federatedUser:<user ID>",
            ]
        }
        ```

{% endif %}
    1. Delete the entry with information about the subject which rights are to be revoked from the `members` list of users.

       For more information about the parameters of the `yandex_resourcemanager_cloud_iam_binding` resource, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/iam_service_account_iam_binding).

    1. Make sure that the configuration files are correct.

        1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
        1. Run the check using the command:

          ```
          terraform plan
          ```

        If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal displays a list of created resources and their parameters. If there are errors in the configuration, {{ TF }} points them out.

    1. Deploy the cloud resources.

        1. If there are no errors in the configuration, run the terraform apply command

           ```
           terraform apply
           ```

        1. Confirm the resource creation: type `yes` in the terminal and press **Enter**.

        Afterwards, all the necessary resources are created in the specified folder. You can verify that the resource has been created in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or with the following [CLI](../../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

        ```
        yc resource-manager cloud list-access-bindings <cloud name>|<cloud ID>
        ```

{% endlist %}
