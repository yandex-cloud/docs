# Deleting a service account

{% note warning %}

Deleting a [service account](../../concepts/users/service-accounts.md) is permanent. You can't restore a deleted service account; you can only [re-create it](create.md).

{% endnote %}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   {% include [delete-sa-via-console](../../../_includes/iam/delete-sa-via-console.md) %}

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. See the description of the delete service account command:

      ```bash
      yc iam service-account delete --help
      ```

   1. Select a service account (for example, `my-robot`):

      ```bash
      yc iam service-account list
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      +----------------------+------------------+-------------------------------+
      |          ID          |       NAME       |          DESCRIPTION          |
      +----------------------+------------------+-------------------------------+
      | aje6o61dvog2h6g9a33s | my-robot         |                               |
      | aje9sda1ufvqcmfksd3f | blabla           | bla bla bla is my description |
      +----------------------+------------------+-------------------------------+
      ```
   1. Delete the service account:

      ```bash
      yc iam service-account delete my-robot
      ```

- {{ TF }}

   If you do not have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   To delete a service account:

   1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and delete the fragment with the service account description.
      Example of the service account description in the {{ TF }} configuration:

      ```hcl
      ...
      resource "yandex_iam_service_account" "sa" {
        name        = "my-robot"
        description = "this is my favorite service account"
       }
      ...
      ```

   1. In the command line, go to the directory with the {{ TF }} configuration file.

   1. Check the configuration using the command:
      ```bash
      terraform validate
      ```

      If the configuration is correct, the following message is returned:

      ```text
      Success! The configuration is valid.
      ```

   1. Run the command:
      ```bash
      terraform plan
      ```

      The terminal will display a list of resources with parameters. No changes are made at this step. If the configuration contains errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Apply the configuration changes:
      ```bash
      terraform apply
      ```

   1. Confirm the changes: type `yes` into the terminal and press **Enter**.

      You can verify that the service account was deleted in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or using the [CLI](../../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

      ```bash
      yc iam service-account list
      ```

- API

   To delete a service account, use the [delete](../../api-ref/ServiceAccount/delete.md) method for the [ServiceAccount](../../api-ref/ServiceAccount/index.md) resource.
