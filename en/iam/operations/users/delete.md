# Deleting a user from the cloud

The fastest way to prevent a user from accessing cloud resources is to remove them from the [organization](../../../organization/):

{% include [edit-account.md](../../../_includes/organization/remove-user.md) %}

If you need to make sure a user does not access individual resources, [revoke](../roles/revoke.md) the relevant roles from the user.
