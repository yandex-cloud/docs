# Adding a user to a cloud

To add users to the cloud, you need the [`admin`](../../concepts/access-control/roles.md#admin) or [`resource-manager.clouds.owner`](../../concepts/access-control/roles.md#owner) role for that cloud.

You can add [users with a Yandex account](#passport-user) and [federated users](#federated-user).
