# Adding a user to the cloud

Add a user to your [organization](../../../organization/) to [grant](../../../iam/operations/roles/grant.md) him or her access to {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

You can add [users with a Yandexaccount](#passport-user) as well as [federated users](#federated-user). To do this, you need to be the organization administrator (the `organization-manager.admin` role) or owner (the `organization-manager.organizations.owner` role).

The user will become an organization member, and you will be able to grant them access to your cloud resources by [assigning](../roles/grant.md) them a [role](../../concepts/access-control/roles.md). A new organization member will not have access to cloud resources until you assign them a role.


## Add a user with a Yandex account {#add-useraccount}

You can add a user to an organization via the management console or {{ org-full-name }}. These methods are carry the same weight.

{% note info %}

{% include [yandex-account-2fa-warning.md](../../../_includes/iam/yandex-account-2fa-warning.md) %}

{% endnote %}

## Add federated users {#federated-user}

To add federated users, you need to know the Name IDs of the users that the Identity Provider Server (IdP) returns in the authentication successful response. This is usually the user's main email address. If you don't know what the server returns as the Name ID, contact the administrator who configured authentication for your federation.

To add federation users to an organization:

{% include [add-federateduser](../../../_includes/organization/add-federateduser.md) %}


#### What's next {#what-is-next}

* [Assign roles to the new users](../roles/grant.md).
