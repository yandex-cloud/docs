# Creating authorized keys

To create [authorized keys](../../concepts/authorization/key.md):

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder the service account belongs to.
   1. Go to the **Service accounts** tab.
   1. Choose a service account and click the line with its name.
   1. Click **Create new key** in the top panel.
   1. Click **Create authorized key**.
   1. Select the encryption algorithm.
   1. Enter a description of the key so that you can easily find it in the management console.
   1. Save both the public and private keys. The private key is not saved in {{ yandex-cloud }}, and you won't be able to view the public key in the management console.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   Create authorized keys for the `my-robot` service account:

   ```bash
   yc iam key create --service-account-name my-robot -o my-robot-key.json
   ```

   If successful, a private key (`privateKey`) and public key ID (`id`) are written to the `my-robot-key.json` file.

   Key file example:

   ```json
   {
      "id": "lfkoe35hsk58aks301nl",
      "service_account_id": "ajepg0mjt06siua65usm",
      "created_at": "2019-03-20T10:04:56Z",
      "key_algorithm": "RSA_2048",
      "public_key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n",
      "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   }
   ```

- API

   To create an access key, use the [create](../../api-ref/Key/create.md) method for the [Key](../../api-ref/Key/index.md) resource.

   Sample request using cURL:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <iam-token>" \
     -d '{"serviceAccountId": "<service-account-id>"}' \
     https://iam.api.cloud.yandex.net/iam/v1/keys
   ```

   Where:
   * `<iam-token>`: The IAM token of the user who has rights to view service accounts in the folder.
   * `<service-account-id>`: The `ID` of the service account that the keys are created for.

   If successful, the server response will contain the private key (`privateKey`) and public key ID (`id`). Save this data. You will not be able to get the key value again.

   Sample server response:

   ```json
   {
       "key": {
           "createdAt": "2018-10-30T15:55:00+00:00",
           "description": "",
           "id": "lfkoe35hsk58aks301nl",
           "keyAlgorithm": "RSA_2048",
           "publicKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n",
           "serviceAccountId": "ajepg0mjt06siua65usm"
       },
       "privateKey": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   }
   ```

{% endlist %}
