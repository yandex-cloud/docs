# Creating a user group

[Group](../../../organization/concepts/groups.md) users if you want to assign the same roles to them. For example, you may want to group employees with the same job duties or from the same department. You can group users by any attribute.

To form a group of users, [create it](#create-group) and [add users to it](#add-member).

## Create a group {#create-group}

{% include [create-group-org](../../../_includes/organization/create-group-org.md) %}

## Add users to the group {#add-member}

{% include [group-add-member.md](../../../_includes/organization/group-add-member.md) %}
