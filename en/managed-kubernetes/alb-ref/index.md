# {{ alb-name }} tool reference for {{ managed-k8s-name }}


{{ alb-name }} provides tools for deploying L7 load balancers in {{ managed-k8s-full-name }} clusters: [Ingress controller](../../application-load-balancer/tools/k8s-ingress-controller/index.md), [Gateway API](../../application-load-balancer/tools/k8s-gateway-api/index.md), and [Gwin](gwin-quickstart.md) controller. 

This reference describes {{ k8s }} resource configurations used by the Ingress controller and Gateway API to deploy an infrastructure. You can find the Gwin resource reference on the controller's [overview page](gwin-index.md).

## Gwin resources {#gwin}

{% include [gwin-resources](../../_includes/managed-kubernetes/alb-ref/gwin-resources.md) %}

## Ingress controller resources {#ingress}

* [Ingress](ingress.md): Backend traffic distribution rules.
* [HttpBackendGroup](http-backend-group.md), [GrpcBackendGroup](grpc-backend-group.md): Combining backends into groups.
* [IngressClass](ingress-class.md): Managing multiple ingress controllers in a {{ k8s }} cluster.
* [Service](service-for-ingress.md): Description of [{{ k8s }} services](../concepts/index.md#service) used as backends. It is different from the `Service` resource for Gateway API: the Ingress controller services support annotations.

## Gateway API resources {#gateway-api}

* [Gateway](gateway.md): Incoming traffic reception and routing (`HTTPRoute` and `TLSRoute`) rules.
* [GatewayPolicy](gateway-policy.md): `Gateway` resource policy, incoming traffic processing configuration.
* [YCCertificate](./yc-certificate.md): {{ certificate-manager-name }} certificate parameters for setting up TLS connections in the `Gateway` resource.
* [HTTPRoute](http-route.md): Rules for redirecting or routing HTTP and HTTPS traffic across backends.
* [RoutePolicy](route-policy.md): `HTTPRoute` resource policy and backend access rule configuration.
* [GRPCRoute](grpc-route.md): Rules for redirecting or routing gRPC traffic across backends.
* [YCStorageBucket](./yc-storage-bucket.md): {{ objstorage-name }} bucket parameters for setting up a backend in the `HTTPRoute` resource.
* [TLSRoute](./tls-route.md): Rules for TLS traffic routing between backends.
* [Service](service-for-gateway.md): Description of {{ k8s }} services used as backends.
