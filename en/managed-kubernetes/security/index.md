### {{ managed-k8s-name }} roles {#yc-api}

The roles described below let you manage {{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters and node groups without public access via the {{ yandex-cloud }} API. To manage cluster resources, these roles should be combined with [roles for the {{ k8s }} API](#k8s-api). When creating a cluster, the roles of its service account are verified.

To create a cluster and node groups without public access, the `k8s.clusters.agent` role is required.

To create a cluster and node groups with public access, the following roles are required:
* `k8s.clusters.agent`.
* `vpc.publicAdmin`.

To create a cluster with [tunnel mode](../concepts/network-policy.md#cilium), you must have the `k8s.tunnelClusters.agent` role.

| Role | Permissions |
--- | ---
| `k8s.admin` | Lets you create, delete, edit, stop, and start clusters and node groups. In the future, it will also let you manage granular access to clusters and groups. |
| `k8s.editor` | Lets you create, delete, edit, stop, and start clusters and node groups. |
| `k8s.viewer` | Lets you view information about {{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters and node groups. |
| `k8s.clusters.agent` | A special role for cluster service accounts. Lets you create node groups, disks, and internal load balancers. Lets you use previously created [KMS keys](../../kms/concepts/key.md) to encrypt and decrypt secrets and connect previously created [security groups](../operations/connect/security-groups.md).<br>In combination with the `load-balancer.admin` role, it lets you create a network load balancer with a public IP address.<br>Includes such roles as `compute.admin`, `iam.serviceAccounts.user`, `kms.keys.encrypterDecrypter`, `load-balancer.privateAdmin`, and `vpc.privateAdmin`. |
| `k8s.tunnelClusters.agent` | Special role for creating clusters with tunnel mode. Lets you create node groups, disks, and internal load balancers. Lets you use previously created KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt secrets.<br>Includes the following roles: `compute.admin`, `iam.serviceAccounts.user`, `k8s.viewer`, `kms.keys.encrypterDecrypter`, and `load-balancer.privateAdmin`. |

### Roles required to access the {{ k8s }} API {#k8s-api}

The following roles grant rights to [manage cluster resources via the {{ k8s }} API based on roles](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) (Role-Based Access Control, RBAC). To manage a cluster, these roles should be combined with [roles for the {{ yandex-cloud }} API](#yc-api). For more information about roles in {{ k8s }} RBAC, see the [{{ k8s }} documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles).

| Role | Permissions |
--- | ---
| `k8s.cluster-api.cluster-admin` | Users with this {{ iam-full-name }} role get the `yc:cluster-admin` group and the `cluster-admin` role in {{ k8s }} RBAC. |
| `k8s.cluster-api.editor` | Users with this {{ iam-name }} role get the `yc:edit` group and the `edit` role in {{ k8s }} RBAC for all [namespaces](../concepts/index.md#namespace) in a cluster. |
| `k8s.cluster-api.viewer` | Users with this {{ iam-name }} role get the `yc:view` group and the `view` role in {{ k8s }} RBAC for all namespaces in the cluster. |

To view the rights to the {{ k8s }} cluster resources available for a specific role, run the command:

```bash
kubectl describe clusterrole <role in {{ k8s }} RBAC>
```

### Primitive roles {#primitive}

Primitive {{ iam-name }} roles contain the above roles in the following combinations:

| Primitive role | Combination of {{ managed-k8s-name }} roles |
--- | ---
| `admin` | `k8s.cluster-api.cluster-admin`, `k8s.admin`, `vpc.publicAdmin`. |
| `editor` | `k8s.cluster-api.cluster-admin`, `k8s.editor`, `vpc.publicAdmin`. |
| `viewer` | `k8s.cluster-api.viewer`, `k8s.viewer`. |

## {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster service accounts {#sa-annotation}

When creating a cluster in {{ managed-k8s-name }}, you should specify two service accounts:
* **Cluster service account**: From this service account, a {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster manages cluster nodes, subnets for pods and services, disks, and load balancers, as well as encrypts and decrypts secrets. The minimum recommended role for this account is `k8s.clusters.agent`.
* **Node group service account**: From this service account, cluster nodes are authenticated in [{{ container-registry-full-name }}](../../container-registry/concepts/index.md). To deploy applications in a cluster using images from {{ container-registry-name }}, you need to assign this account a {{ container-registry-name }} [service role](../../container-registry/security/index.md#service-roles). If you use a different container registry, you can skip assigning roles to this service account.

## Accessing the {{ managed-k8s-name }} management console {#ui-annotation}

To access {{ managed-k8s-name }} via the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), the minimum required role is `k8s.viewer`.

To get detailed information about clusters and node groups, you'll need an additional role: `k8s.cluster-api.viewer`. This role corresponds to the `viewer` role in {{ k8s }} RBAC and grants access rights to a limited set of resources in the {{ k8s }} API, so the console's features are limited.

Users with the `k8s.cluster-api.cluster-admin` role have full access to the cluster's {{ k8s }} API and can use all the features of the management console.

To provide more granular access to the necessary resources, you can:
* Configure additional rights in {{ k8s }} RBAC for the appropriate users.
* Expand the `view` and `edit` role in {{ k8s }} RBAC using [role aggregation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles). For example, you can allow all users with the `view` role in the {{ k8s }} API (including users with the `k8s.cluster-api.viewer` cloud role) to view information about nodes by adding the following role to the cluster:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    name: view-extensions
    labels:
      rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true"
  rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["nodes"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  ```
