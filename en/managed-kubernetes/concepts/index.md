# Relationships between resources in {{ managed-k8s-name }}

[{{ k8s }}]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://kubernetes.io/ru/){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://https://kubernetes.io/){% endif %} is an environment for managing containerized applications. {{ k8s }} provides mechanisms for interacting with clusters that can automate tasks like deploying, scaling, and managing applications in containers.

The main entity in the service is the _{{ k8s }} cluster_.

## {{ k8s }} cluster {#kubernetes-cluster}

{{ k8s }} clusters consist of a master and one or more node groups. The master is responsible for managing the {{ k8s }} cluster. Containerized user applications are run on nodes.

The service fully controls the master and monitors the status and health of node groups. Users can manage nodes directly and configure {{ k8s }} clusters using the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console and the {{ managed-k8s-name }} CLI and API.

{% note warning %}

Groups of {{ k8s }} nodes require internet access for downloading images and components.

Internet access can be provided in the following ways:
* By assigning each node in the group a [public IP address](../../vpc/concepts/address.md#public-addresses).
* [Configuring a virtual machine as a NAT instance](../../tutorials/routing/nat-instance.md).
* [Enabling egress NAT](../../vpc/operations/enable-nat.md).

{% endnote %}

{{ k8s }} clusters in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure use the following resources:

Resource | Amount | Comment
--- | --- | ---
Subnet | 2 | {{ k8s }} reserves ranges of IP addresses to use for pods and services.
Public IP | N | The number N includes:<br>* **One** public IP address for the NAT instance.<br>* A public IP address assigned to **each** node in the group if you use one-to-one NAT technology.

## Master {#master}

_Masters_ are components that manage {{ k8s }} clusters.

They run {{ k8s }} control processes that include the {{ k8s }} API server, scheduler, and main resource controllers. The master lifecycle is managed by the service when creating or deleting a {{ k8s }} cluster. The master is responsible for global solutions that are run on all {{ k8s }} cluster nodes. These include scheduling workloads (such as containerized applications), managing the lifecycle of workloads, and scaling.

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

There are two types of masters that differ by their location in [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md):
* _Zonal_: A master created in a subnet in one availability zone.
* _Regional_: A master created and distributed in three subnets in each availability zone. If a zone becomes unavailable, the regional master remains functional.

  {% note warning %}

  The internal IP address of a regional master is only available within a single {{ vpc-full-name }} cloud network.

  {% endnote %}

{% endif %}

{% if product == "cloud-il" %}

–ê master created in a subnet in one [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md). It is called _zonal_.

{% endif %}

## Node group {#node-group}

A _node group_ is a group of VMs in a {{ k8s }} cluster that have the same configuration and run the user's containers.

### Configuration {#config}

When you create a group of nodes, you can configure the following VM parameters:
* VM type.
* Type and number of cores (vCPU).
* Amount of memory (RAM) and disk space.
* Kernel parameters.
  * _Safe_ kernel parameters are isolated between pods.
  * _Unsafe_ parameters affect the operation of the pods and the node as a whole. In {{ managed-k8s-name }}, you can't change unsafe kernel parameters unless their names have been explicitly specified when [creating the node group](../operations/node-group/node-group-create.md).

  For more information about kernel parameters, see the [{{ k8s }} documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/sysctl-cluster/).

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

You can create groups with different configurations in a {{ k8s }} cluster and place them in different availability zones.

{% endif %}

### Connecting to group nodes {#node-connect-ssh}

You can connect to nodes in a group via SSH. Learn more in [Connecting to a node via SSH](../operations/node-connect-ssh.md).

### Taints and tolerations policies {#taints-tolerations}

_Taints_ are special policies assigned to nodes in the group. Taints let you prevent certain pods from running on certain nodes. For example, you can allow the rendering pods to run only on [nodes with GPU](node-group/node-group-gpu.md).

Benefits of taints:
* The policies persist when a node is restarted or replaced with a new one.
* When adding nodes to a group, the policies are assigned to the node automatically.
* The policies are automatically assigned to new nodes when [scaling a node group](autoscale.md).

You can assign a taint to a node group only at [creation](../operations/node-group/node-group-create.md).

{% note warning %}

Do not confuse [{{ k8s }} node labels](#node-labels) (`node_labels`) managed by {{ managed-k8s-name }}, with taints.

{% endnote %}

Each taint has three parts:

```text
<key> = <value>:<effect>
```

List of available taint effects:
* `NO_SCHEDULE`: Prevent launching of new pods on the group's nodes (the running pods won't stop).
* `PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE`: Avoid launching pods on the group's nodes if other groups have free resources to run these pods.
* `NO_EXECUTE`: Stop pods on the group's nodes, drain the pods across other groups, and prevent new pods from running.

_Tolerations_: Exceptions from taint policies. Using tolerations, you can allow certain pods to run on nodes, even if the taint policy of the node group prevents this.

For example, if the taint policy for nodes in a group is `key1=value1:NoSchedule`, you can add pods to such nodes using tolerations:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
...
spec:
  ...
  tolerations:
  - key: "key1"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value1"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

{% note info %}

System pods are automatically assigned tolerations so they can run on any available node.

{% endnote %}

For more information about taints and tolerations, see the [documentation {{ k8s }}](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).

## Pod {#pod}

A _pod_ is a request to run one or more containers on a group node. In a {{ k8s }} cluster, each pod has a unique IP address so that applications do not conflict when using ports.

Containers are described in pods via JSON or YAML objects.

### IP masquerade for pods {#pod-ip-masquerade}

If a pod needs access to resources outside the {{ k8s }} cluster, its IP address will be replaced by the IP address of the node the pod is running on. For this purpose, the cluster uses [IP masquerading](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/ip-masq-agent/).

By default, IP masquerade is enabled for the entire range of pod IP addresses.

To implement IP masquerading, the `ip-masq-agent` pod is deployed on each cluster node. The settings for this pod are stored in a ConfigMap object called `ip-masq-agent`. If you need to disable pod IP masquerading, for example, to access the pods over a VPN{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %} or [{{ interconnect-full-name }}](../../interconnect/){% endif %}, specify the desired IP ranges in the `data.config.nonMasqueradeCIDRs` parameter:

```yaml
...
data:
  config: |+
    nonMasqueradeCIDRs:
      - <CIDR of pod IP addresses to skip masquerading>
...
```

## Service {#service}

A [_service_](service.md) is an abstraction that provides network load balancing functions. Traffic rules are configured for a group of pods united by a set of labels.

By default, a service is only available within a specific {{ k8s }} cluster, but it can be public and receive [requests from outside](../operations/create-load-balancer.md#lb-create) the {{ k8s }} cluster.

## Namespace {#namespace}

_A namespace_ is an abstraction that logically isolates {{ k8s }} cluster resources and distributes [quotas]({{ link-console-quotas }}) to them. This is useful for isolating resources of different teams and projects in a single {{ k8s }} cluster.

## Service accounts {#service-accounts}

{{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters use two types of service accounts:
* **Cloud service accounts**

  These accounts exist at the level of an individual folder in the cloud and can be used both by {{ managed-k8s-name }} and other services.

  For more information, see [{#T}](../security/index.md) and [{#T}](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md).
* **Service accounts{{ k8s }}**

  These accounts exist and run only at a level of an individual {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster. {{ k8s }} uses them for:
  * To authenticate cluster API calls from applications deployed in the cluster.
  * To configure access for these applications.

  A number of {{ k8s }} service accounts are automatically created in the `kube-system` namespace when deploying a {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster.

  {{ k8s }} creates a token for each of these accounts. This token is used for authentication within the {{ k8s }} cluster that the account belongs to.

  For more information, see the [{{ k8s }} documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/).

{% note warning %}

Do not confuse [cloud service accounts](../security/index.md#sa-annotation) and {{ k8s }} service accounts.

In the service documentation, _service account_ refers to a regular cloud service account unless otherwise specified.

{% endnote %}

## Node labels {#node-labels}

_Node labels_, `node_labels` are a mechanism for grouping nodes together in {{ k8s }}. You can use node labels to manage pod distribution across the nodes of a cluster. For more information, see the [{{ k8s }} documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes).

{% note warning %}

Do not confuse [cloud labels of a node group](../../overview/concepts/services.md#labels) (`labels`) and [{{ k8s }} labels of nodes]({{ k8s-docs }}/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) (`node_labels`) which are managed by {{ managed-k8s-name }}.

We recommend managing all node labels via the [{{ managed-k8s-name }} API](../api-ref/NodeGroup/index.md) method, because by default, when [updating or changing a node group](../operations/node-group/node-group-update.md), some of the nodes are recreated with different names and some of the old ones are deleted. That's why the labels added via the [{{ k8s }} API]({{ k8s-docs }}/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api) may get lost. Conversely, using the {{ k8s }} API to delete labels created via the {{ managed-k8s-name }} API has no effect since such labels will be restored.

{% endnote %}

Node labels can only be set when creating a node group. Each object can be assigned a set of node labels in the form of a `key:value` pair. Each key must be unique to an object.

Node label keys can consist of two parts: an optional prefix and a name separated by a `/`.

A prefix is an optional part of a key. Prefix requirements:
* It must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS tags separated by dots `.`.
* The length can be up to 253 characters.
* The last character must be followed by a `/`.

A name is a required part of a key. Naming requirements:
* The length can be up to 63 characters.
* May contain lowercase Latin letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods.
* The first and the last characters must be a letter or number.

For managing node labels, see [{#T}](../operations/node-group/node-label-management.md).
