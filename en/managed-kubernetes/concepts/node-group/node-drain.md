# Evicting pods from a node

When you update a node group, the pods are evicted from the old node to move to the new node. To make sure that eviction doesn't affect the availability of the services provided by your applications in the {{ k8s }} cluster, configure the {{ k8s }} API [PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.17/#poddisruptionbudget-v1beta1-policy) object for the pods of your application.

The `PodDisruptionBudget` object is defined by three fields:

* `.spec.selector`: A selector label to indicate the set of applicable pods. Required field.
* `.spec.minAvailable`: The minimum number of pods from the set to be available after eviction. You can specify it as a percentage value.
* `.spec.maxUnavailable`: The maximum number of pods from the set that may be unavailable after eviction. You can specify it as a percentage value.

If you don't define the [PodDisruptionBudget policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/), the pods are evicted all at once, which may cause issues in your application.

{% note warning %}

* A pod can only be evicted if it was created by an application replication controller: [ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/), [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/), or [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/). If a pod is created without a controller, it's lost during the update.
* [Persistent volumes](../volume.md) (`PersistentVolumes` objects) used by the pods, which are managed by the `StatefulSet` controller, can only be moved between nodes within a single availability zone.

{% endnote %}

Specifics for evicting pods from nodes:

* Configure the `PodDisruptionBudgets` policy to make it impossible to evict too many pods at once, but possible to evict at least one.
* During pod eviction, there is a node stop timeout (7 minutes). The node is stopped even if not all pods are evicted during that time.
* When you downsize a node group to evict pods and then delete nodes, the nodes without pods are drained and deleted first. You can also manually drain the nodes you no longer need using the `kubectl drain` command.
* The nodes to be drained and stopped are marked `Unschedulable`. This helps you avoid creating new pods on them.
* Nodes in the group are drained one at a time.
* Nodes are not drained when a node group is deleted. If requests are sent to pods on the deleted nodes, they aren't processed until {{ k8s }} diagnoses the node as faulty and creates pods on the running nodes. To avoid this, change the size of the node group to zero, wait for the operation to complete, and delete the node group.
