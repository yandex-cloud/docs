# Configuring security groups

[Security groups](../../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) operate on the principle that unless traffic is allowed, it is blocked. For a cluster to run, you need to [create rules](../../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) in its security groups to allow:
* [Service traffic within the cluster](#rules-internal).
* [Connections to services from the internet](#rules-nodes).
* [Connections to nodes over SSH](#rules-nodes-ssh).
* [API access{{ k8s }}](#rules-master).

You can set more detailed rules for security groups, such as allowing traffic in only specific [subnets](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).

Security groups must be correctly configured for all subnets that will host the [cluster](../../concepts/index.md#kubernetes-cluster). This determines the performance and availability of the cluster and the services running there.

Prior to editing security groups or the settings of any included rules, make sure this is not going to disrupt the cluster or its node groups.

{% note alert %}

Do not delete the security groups bound to a running cluster or node group as this might result in disruptions in their operation and data loss.

## Creating rules for service traffic {#rules-internal}

{% note warning %}

Rules for service traffic are required for a regional cluster to work.

{% endnote %}

1. Add rules for incoming traffic.
   * For a network load balancer:
      * Port range: `{{ port-any }}`.
      * Protocol: `TCP`.
      * Source type: `CIDR`.
      * Destination: `198.18.235.0/24` and `198.18.248.0/24`.
   * To transfer service traffic between the [master](../../concepts/index.md#master) and [nodes](../../concepts/index.md#node-group):
      * Port range: `{{ port-any }}`:
         * Protocol: `Any`.
         * Source type: `Security group`.
         * Security group: Current (`Self`).
   * To transfer traffic between [pods](../../concepts/index.md#pod) and [services](../../concepts/index.md#service):
      * Port range: `{{ port-any }}`.
      * Protocol: `Any`.
      * Source type: `CIDR`.
      * Destination: Specify the IP address ranges of the subnets created along with the cluster, such as:
         * `10.96.0.0/16`.
         * `10.112.0.0/16`.
   * To test the nodes using ICMP requests from the subnets within {{ yandex-cloud }}:
      * Protocol: `ICMP`.
      * Source type: `CIDR`.
      * Destination: IP address ranges of the subnets within {{ yandex-cloud }} from which you'll  perform cluster diagnostics, such as:
         * `10.0.0.0/8`.
         * `192.168.0.0/16`.
         * `172.16.0.0/12`.
1. Add a rule for outgoing traffic that allows cluster hosts to connect to external resources, for example, to download images from Docker Hub or work with [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../../tutorials/backup.md):
   * Port range: `{{ port-any }}`.
   * Protocol: `Any`.
   * Source type: `CIDR`.
   * Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`.

## Creating a rule for connecting to services from the internet {#rules-nodes}

The services running on nodes are accessible from the internet and subnets within {{ yandex-cloud }} after you create a rule for incoming traffic:
* Port range: `30000-32767`.
* Protocol: `TCP`.
* Source type: `CIDR`.
* Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`.

## Creating a rule for connecting to nodes via SSH {#rules-nodes-ssh}

To connect to nodes over SSH, create a rule for incoming traffic:
* Port: `{{ port-ssh }}`.
* Protocol: `TCP`.
* Source type: `CIDR`.
* Destination: IP address ranges of the subnets within {{ yandex-cloud }} and public IP addresses of computers on the internet, for example:
   * `10.0.0.0/8`.
   * `192.168.0.0/16`.
   * `172.16.0.0/12`.
   * `85.32.32.22/32`.

## Creating rules to access the {{ k8s }} API {#rules-master}

To access the {{ k8s }} API and manage clusters using `kubectl` and other utilities, you need rules that allow connections to the master via ports `{{ port-k8s }}` and `{{ port-https }}`. Create two rules for incoming traffic, one per port:
* Ports: `{{ port-https }}`, `{{ port-k8s }}`.
* Protocol: `TCP`.
* Source type: `CIDR`.
* Destination: Specify the IP address range of the subnets from which you'll manage the cluster, such as:
   * `85.23.23.22/32`: For the external network.
   * `192.168.0.0/24`: For the internal network.

## Examples {#examples}

{% list tabs %}

- {{ TF }}

   For example, you need to create rules for an existing {{ k8s }} cluster:
   * With the zonal master located in the `{{ region-id }}-a` availability zone.
   * With the `worker-nodes-with` node group.
   * With access to services:
      * From the load balancer's address range `198.18.235.0/24` and `198.18.248.0/24`.
      * From the internal subnet `10.129.0.0/24` to transfer traffic between pods and services.
      * From the internal subnet `172.16.0.0/12` for the ICMP protocol.
      * From the internet from any address (`0.0.0.0/0`) to a range of NodePorts (`30000-32767`).
   * With access to nodes from the internet from the address `85.32.32.22/32` to port `{{ port-ssh }}`.
   * With access to the {{ k8s }} API from an external subnet from an address range `203.0.113.0/24` via ports `{{ port-https }}` and `{{ port-k8s }}`.

   Four security groups are created:
   * `k8s-main-sg`: Rules for service traffic.
   * `k8s-public-services`: Rules for connecting to nodes from the internet.
   * `k8s-nodes-ssh-access`: Rules for connecting to nodes over SSH.
   * `k8s-master-whitelist`: Rules for accessing the cluster API.
