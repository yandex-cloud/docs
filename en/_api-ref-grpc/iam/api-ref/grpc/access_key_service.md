## Calls AccessKeyService {#calls}

## List {#List}

Retrieves the list of access keys for the specified service account.

**rpc List ([ListAccessKeysRequest](#ListAccessKeysRequest)) returns ([ListAccessKeysResponse](#ListAccessKeysResponse))**

### ListAccessKeysRequest {#ListAccessKeysRequest}

Field | Description
--- | ---
service_account_id | **string**<br>ID of the service account to list access keys for. To get the service account ID, use a [yandex.cloud.iam.v1.ServiceAccountService.List](/docs/iam/grpc/service_account_service#List) request. If not specified, it defaults to the subject that made the request. The maximum string length in characters is 50.
page_size | **int64**<br>The maximum number of results per page to return. If the number of available results is larger than `page_size`, the service returns a [ListAccessKeysResponse.next_page_token](#ListAccessKeysResponse) that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Default value: 100. The maximum value is 1000.
page_token | **string**<br>Page token. To get the next page of results, set `page_token` to the [ListAccessKeysResponse.next_page_token](#ListAccessKeysResponse) returned by a previous list request. The maximum string length in characters is 100.
