# ApiKeyService

A set of methods for managing API keys.

| Call | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [List](#List) | Retrieves the list of API keys for the specified service account. |
| [Get](#Get) | Returns the specified API key. |
| [Create](#Create) | Creates an API key for the specified service account. |
| [Update](#Update) | Updates the specified API key. |
| [Delete](#Delete) | Deletes the specified API key. |

## Calls ApiKeyService {#calls}

## List {#List}

Retrieves the list of API keys for the specified service account.

**rpc List ([ListApiKeysRequest](#ListApiKeysRequest)) returns ([ListApiKeysResponse](#ListApiKeysResponse))**

### ListApiKeysRequest {#ListApiKeysRequest}

Field | Description
--- | ---
service_account_id | **string**<br>ID of the service account to list API keys for. To get the service account ID, use a [yandex.cloud.iam.v1.ServiceAccountService.List](/docs/iam/grpc/service_account_service#List) request. If not specified, it defaults to the subject that made the request. The maximum string length in characters is 50.
page_size | **int64**<br>The maximum number of results per page to return. If the number of available results is larger than `page_size`, the service returns a [ListApiKeysResponse.next_page_token](#ListApiKeysResponse) that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Default value: 100. Acceptable values are 0 to 1000, inclusive.
page_token | **string**<br>Page token. To get the next page of results, set `page_token` to the [ListApiKeysResponse.next_page_token](#ListApiKeysResponse) returned by a previous list request. The maximum string length in characters is 100.
