### Vulnerability {#Vulnerability}

Field | Description
--- | ---
severity | enum **Severity**<br>Output only. Severity of the Vulnerability. <ul><li>`CRITICAL`: Critical severity is a world-burning problem, exploitable for nearly all users. Includes remote root privilege escalations, or massive data loss.</li><li>`HIGH`: High severity is a real problem, exploitable for many users in a default installation. Includes serious remote denial of services, local root privilege escalations, or data loss.</li><li>`MEDIUM`: Medium severity is a real security problem, and is exploitable for many users. Includes network daemon denial of service attacks, cross-site scripting, and gaining user privileges. Updates should be made soon for this priority of issue.</li><li>`LOW`: Low severity is a security problem, but is hard to exploit due to environment, requires a user-assisted attack, a small install base, or does very little damage. These tend to be included in security updates only when higher priority issues require an update, or if many low priority issues have built up.</li><li>`NEGLIGIBLE`: Negligible severity is technically a security problem, but is only theoretical in nature, requires a very special situation, has almost no install base, or does no real damage. These tend not to get backport from upstream, and will likely not be included in security updates unless there is an easy fix and some other issue causes an update.</li><li>`UNDEFINED`: Unknown severity is either a security problem that has not been assigned to a priority yet or a priority that our system did not recognize.</li><ul/>
vulnerability | **oneof:** `package`<br>Details of vulnerability depending on type. Only 'package' vulnerability is supported at the moment.
