# DatabaseService

A set of methods for managing MySQL databases in a cluster. 

See [the documentation](/docs/managed-mysql/operations/databases) for details.

| Call | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Get](#Get) | Retrieves information about the specified database. |
| [List](#List) | Retrieves the list of databases in a cluster. |
| [Create](#Create) | Creates a new database in a cluster. |
| [Delete](#Delete) | Deletes a database from a cluster. |

## Calls DatabaseService {#calls}

## Get {#Get}

Retrieves information about the specified database.

**rpc Get ([GetDatabaseRequest](#GetDatabaseRequest)) returns ([Database](#Database))**

### GetDatabaseRequest {#GetDatabaseRequest}

Field | Description
--- | ---
cluster_id | **string**<br>Required. ID of the cluster that the database belongs to. <br>To get this ID, make a [ClusterService.List](./cluster_service#List) request. The maximum string length in characters is 50.
database_name | **string**<br>Required. Name of the database to return information about. <br>To get this name, make a [DatabaseService.List](#List) request. The maximum string length in characters is 63. Value must match the regular expression ` [a-zA-Z0-9_-]* `.


### Database {#Database}

Field | Description
--- | ---
name | **string**<br>Name of the database. 
cluster_id | **string**<br>ID of the cluster that the database belongs to. 


## List {#List}

Retrieves the list of databases in a cluster.

**rpc List ([ListDatabasesRequest](#ListDatabasesRequest)) returns ([ListDatabasesResponse](#ListDatabasesResponse))**

### ListDatabasesRequest {#ListDatabasesRequest}

Field | Description
--- | ---
cluster_id | **string**<br>Required. ID of the cluster to list databases in. <br>To get this ID, make a [ClusterService.List](./cluster_service#List) request. The maximum string length in characters is 50.
page_size | **int64**<br>The maximum number of results per page to return. <br>If the number of available results is larger than `page_size`, the API returns a [ListDatabasesResponse.next_page_token](#ListDatabasesResponse) that can be used to get the next page of results in the subsequent [DatabaseService.List](#List) requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 1000, inclusive.
page_token | **string**<br>Page token that can be used to iterate through multiple pages of results. <br>To get the next page of results, set `page_token` to the [ListDatabasesResponse.next_page_token](#ListDatabasesResponse) returned by the previous [DatabaseService.List](#List) request. The maximum string length in characters is 100.


### ListDatabasesResponse {#ListDatabasesResponse}

Field | Description
--- | ---
databases[] | **[Database](#Database1)**<br>List of databases. 
next_page_token | **string**<br>The token that can be used to get the next page of results. <br>If the number of results is larger than [ListDatabasesRequest.page_size](#ListDatabasesRequest), use the `next_page_token` as the value for the [ListDatabasesRequest.page_token](#ListDatabasesRequest) in the subsequent [DatabaseService.List](#List) request to iterate through multiple pages of results. <br>Each of the subsequent [DatabaseService.List](#List) requests should use the `next_page_token` value returned by the previous request to continue paging through the results. 


### Database {#Database1}

Field | Description
--- | ---
name | **string**<br>Name of the database. 
cluster_id | **string**<br>ID of the cluster that the database belongs to. 


## Create {#Create}

Creates a new database in a cluster.

**rpc Create ([CreateDatabaseRequest](#CreateDatabaseRequest)) returns ([operation.Operation](#Operation))**

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation.metadata:[CreateDatabaseMetadata](#CreateDatabaseMetadata)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation.response:[Database](#Database2)<br>

### CreateDatabaseRequest {#CreateDatabaseRequest}

Field | Description
--- | ---
cluster_id | **string**<br>Required. ID of the cluster to create the database in. <br>To get this ID, make a [ClusterService.List](./cluster_service#List) request. The maximum string length in characters is 50.
