### AutoscalingConfig {#AutoscalingConfig5}

Field | Description
--- | ---
max_hosts_count | **int64**<br>Upper limit for total instance subcluster count. Acceptable values are 1 to 100, inclusive.
preemptible | **bool**<br>Preemptible instances are stopped at least once every 24 hours, and can be stopped at any time if their resources are needed by Compute. For more information, see [Preemptible Virtual Machines](/docs/compute/concepts/preemptible-vm).

During this time, the group size doesn't decrease, even if the new metric values indicate that it should. Acceptable values are 1m to 30m, inclusive.
cpu_utilization_target | **double**<br>Defines an autoscaling rule based on the average CPU utilization of the instance group. Acceptable values are 10 to 100, inclusive.

## Delete {#Delete}

Deletes the specified subcluster.

**rpc Delete ([DeleteSubclusterRequest](#DeleteSubclusterRequest)) returns ([operation.Operation](#Operation2))**

Metadata and response of Operation:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation.metadata:[DeleteSubclusterMetadata](#DeleteSubclusterMetadata)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation.response:[google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty)<br>

### DeleteSubclusterRequest {#DeleteSubclusterRequest}

Field | Description
--- | ---
cluster_id | **string**<br>Required. ID of the cluster to remove a subcluster from. <br>To get a cluster ID, make a [ClusterService.List](./cluster_service#List) request. The maximum string length in characters is 50.
subcluster_id | **string**<br>Required. ID of the subcluster to delete. The maximum string length in characters is 50.
decommission_timeout | **int64**<br>Timeout to gracefully decommission nodes. In seconds. Default value: 0 Acceptable values are 0 to 86400, inclusive.


### Operation {#Operation2}

Field | Description
--- | ---
id | **string**<br>ID of the operation. 
description | **string**<br>Description of the operation. 0-256 characters long. 
created_at | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**<br>Creation timestamp. 
created_by | **string**<br>ID of the user or service account who initiated the operation. 
modified_at | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**<br>The time when the Operation resource was last modified. 
done | **bool**<br>If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. 
metadata | **[google.protobuf.Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any)<[DeleteSubclusterMetadata](#DeleteSubclusterMetadata)>**<br>Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains the ID of the target resource that the operation is performed on. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. 
result | **oneof:** `error` or `response`<br>The operation result. If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set. If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set. If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set.
&nbsp;&nbsp;error | **[google.rpc.Status](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/reference/rpc/google.rpc#status)**<br>The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;response | **[google.protobuf.Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any)<[google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty)>**<br>if operation finished successfully.
