# SymmetricCryptoService

--- Data plane for KMS symmetric cryptography operations 
Set of methods that perform symmetric encryption and decryption.

| Call | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Encrypt](#Encrypt) | Encrypts given plaintext with the specified key. |
| [Decrypt](#Decrypt) | Decrypts the given ciphertext with the specified key. |
| [ReEncrypt](#ReEncrypt) | Re-encrypts a ciphertext with the specified KMS key. |
| [GenerateDataKey](#GenerateDataKey) | Generates a new symmetric data encryption key (not a KMS key) and returns the generated key as plaintext and as ciphertext encrypted with the specified symmetric KMS key. |
