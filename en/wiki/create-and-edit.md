# Creating pages

{{ wiki-name }} supports multiple types of pages:

## Page {#page}

A common page with text, images, tables, attached files, and so on.

- [{#T}](create-page.md)

## Note {#note}

A page in your notes section (`{{ wiki-notes }}`). Notes can only be seen by you by default, but you can always change the access rights.

- [{#T}](create-note.md)

## Dynamic table {#grid}

Dynamic tables let users sort values, specify data types to display, and set required cells. You can use the table directly or [embed it in a page](add-grid.md).

- [{#T}](create-grid.md)

- [{#T}](import-export-grid.md)
