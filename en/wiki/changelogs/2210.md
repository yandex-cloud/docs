## Automatic settings of the width of dynamic tables {#autoscale-grids}

If you don't set the width of columns when creating a dynamic table, the width is selected automatically depending on the column type.

## Search by dynamic table content {#search-in-grids}

You can now perform a search by content in dynamic tables. To open the search bar, click ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/search.svg) next to the desired table.

## The **Expand** button for viewing the page tree {#full-list-of-pages}

Clicking the ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/navigation-tree-item.svg) icon next to the name of a cluster in the {{ wiki-name }} structure opens a list of all nested pages and subclusters. Previously, the number of pages in the list was limited. Now, you can view all the contents of a cluster by loading next pages with the **Expand** button.

## Setting up the contrast {#contrast-range}

You can manage the contrast of the {{ wiki-name }} interface. To enable a contrasting theme, open the settings in the left panel using ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/settings.svg) and select **High** on the **Layout** â†’ **Contrast** page.

## Changing the URL of a page at its transfer {#change-url}

When transfering a page to a new cluster, you can change its URL using the **Change page address** option.

## Downloading a dynamic table in XLS format {#grid-xls}

You can now export dynamic tables from {{ wiki-name }} as an Excel table.

## Adding rows in any table part {#line}

In [dynamic tables](../create-grid.md), you can now add rows in any table part.
