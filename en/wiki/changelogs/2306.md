## Search suggestions {#search-suggestions}

It is now easier to configure [page permissions](../page-management/access-setup.md) and edit a [list of page authors](../page-management/edit-owner.md): when searching, suggestions are triggered as soon as you start typing an employee's name or username.


Suggestions are available for {{ ya-360 }} departments and teams and {{ org-full-name }} groups.
