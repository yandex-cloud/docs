## Migration to the new interface {#new-interface}

We have migrated all {{ wiki-full-name }} users to the new interface. They can no longer switch back to the old interface.



## The new editor is now the default one {#new-editor}

There is now a new sequence of formats in the page creation window. The user is first prompted to create a page in the [new editor](../wysiwyg-create.md) and then in the [old](../create-page.md) one.


## Setting column width in dynamic tables {#col-width}

In the [dynamic table](../actions/grid-reference.md) column settings, you can set the width in pixels or as a percentage, as well as leave the default `Auto` width. In `Auto` mode, all columns have the same width, regardless of the cell content.

## Opening a parent table {#parent-table}

The settings of [embedded](../actions/grid-reference.md) dynamic tables now contain a new item: ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/parent-table.svg) **Parent table**. This allows you to open the parent table of an embedded dynamic table in a new browser tab. Quick access to the parent table is helpful, for example, if edits are disabled for the embedded table.
