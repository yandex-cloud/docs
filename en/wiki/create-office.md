# Creating Microsoft Office 365 documents

In {{wiki-name}}, you can work with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents. Create a document using either [{{ wiki-name }}](office365/create-ms-office.md) or [SharePoint](./office365/create-sharepoint.md).

Office 365 documents are stored in [SharePoint](./office365/create-sharepoint.md#shared-site) or your OneDrive personal folder. You can [embed](office365/create-ms-office.md#embed-existing) them in any Wiki page. This way, you can easily share your documents, spreadsheets, or presentations and [co-edit them with your colleagues](office365/co-edit.md).
