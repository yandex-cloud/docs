# Dynamic blocks

Dynamic blocks are fragments of a Wiki page that are auto-generated based on data taken from the page or external sources.

You can use dynamic blocks to:

* Build [page lists](actions/page-lists.md) related to the specified page.

* Embed [dynamic tables](actions/grid-reference.md) on Wiki pages.

* Compose a [table of contents for a document](actions/toc.md).

* Embed [objects from external sources](actions/iframe.md) on Wiki pages.

* Configure integration with [{{forms-full-name}}](actions/forms.md) and [{{tracker-full-name}}](actions/tracker.md).

General format for generating dynamic blocks:

```
{{blockName parameter1="value1" parameter2="value2" ...}}
```
