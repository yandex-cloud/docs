# Dynamic blocks

A dynamic block is a part of a page where content is formed automatically based on data about the page or information from an external source.

With the help of dynamic blocks, you can:

* Build [page lists](actions/page-lists.md) related to a specified page.

* Embed [a dynamic table](actions/grid-reference.md) in the page.

* Generate a [table of contents for the document](actions/objects.md#toc).

General format for calling dynamic blocks:

```
{{blockName parameter1="value1" parameter2="value2" ...}}
```
