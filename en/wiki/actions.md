# Dynamic blocks

You can add a dynamic block on your [Wiki page](pages-types.md#page) to create a page section generated automatically based on page details or data from an external source.

With the help of dynamic blocks, you can:

* Build [page lists](actions/page-lists.md) related to a specified page.

* Embed [a dynamic table](actions/grid-reference.md) in your Wiki page.

* Generate a [table of contents for the document](actions/toc.md).

* Embed [objects from external sources](actions/iframe.md) in your Wiki page.

* Set up integration with [{{forms-full-name}}](actions/forms.md) and [{{tracker-full-name}}](actions/tracker.md).

General format for calling dynamic blocks:

```
{{blockName parameter1="value1" parameter2="value2" ...}}
```
