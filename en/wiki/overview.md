# Service overview

{{ wiki-full-name }} a service for creating a corporate knowledge base, which is filled and updated by company users and employees.

On {{ wiki-name}} pages, you can store information that employees need for work: memos, useful links and contacts, instructions, project documentation, and personal notes. {{ wiki-name }} gives the company's employees additional opportunities for collaboration: they can share information, search for answers to frequently asked questions, and discuss issues in the page comments.



## Access to {{ wiki-full-name }} {#access}

Users registered in [{{ org-full-name }}](../organization/) can work in {{ wiki-full-name }}. For an organization, its own knowledge base is created in {{ wiki-full-name }}, which is only accessible to employees. Read about how to connect {{ wiki-full-name }} in the cluster [{#T}](enable-wiki.md).

To get access to {{ wiki-name }}, [log in to the account](login.md) that you use for the organization.

If the company has a user and access management system (for example, Active Directory or Google Workspace), employees can use their corporate accounts to log in to the {{ yandex-cloud }} organization and access {{ wiki-name }} using a Single Sign-On (SSO) system. To do this, the organization administrator must set up an identity federation. Read more in the  {{ org-full-name }} documentation under [{#T}](../organization/add-federation.md).
