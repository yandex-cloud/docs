# Service overview

{{ wiki-full-name }} is a service for creating a corporate knowledge base, which is maintained and updated by users â€” the organization employees.

{{ wiki-name}} can be used to store any information that the organization employees may need in their work: memos, useful links and contacts, work instructions, project documentation, and personal notes. {{ wiki-name }} provides employees with additional opportunities for collaboration: they can share information, search for answers to frequently asked questions, and discuss tasks in page comments.

## Access to {{ wiki-full-name }} {#access}

{{ wiki-full-name }} can be accessed by organization employees registered on [{{ org-full-name }}](../organization/index.yaml). Each organization has its own knowledge base on {{ wiki-full-name }}, which can only be accessed by the organization employees. To learn more about setting up {{ wiki-full-name }}, read [{#T}](enable-wiki.md).

To access {{ wiki-name }}, [log in to your corporate account](login.md).

If the organization has a user and access management system (such as Active Directory or Google Workspace), employees can use their corporate accounts to log in to the {{ yandex-cloud }} organization and access {{ wiki-name }} through a Single Sign-On (SSO) system. To do this, the organization admin needs to configure identity federation. Read more in the {{ org-full-name }} documentation in the [{#T}](../organization/add-federation.md) section.
