## How to save Delta notes on {{ wiki-name }} {#delta-save}

Delta notes can be saved on any editable Wiki page in {{ wiki-name }}. For example, any co-editor can save the text to their personal cluster.

To save the text to {{wiki-name}}:

1. Click **Upload to Wiki** and specify the relative link to the Wiki page in the following format:
```{{ wiki-pagename }}```

1. Click **Continue**. If you upload different versions of a note to the same address on {{ wiki-name }}, the older versions will be overwritten. However, you can view all the versions in the [edit history](history.md).
