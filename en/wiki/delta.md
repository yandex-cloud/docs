## How to save text from Delta to {{ wiki-name }} {#delta-save}

You can save Delta notes on any editable Wiki page in {{ wiki-name }}. For example, each collaborator can save the text to their private cluster.

To save your text to {{wiki-name}}:

1. Click the **Export to Wiki** button, then specify a relative link to your Wiki page in the format: 
```{{ wiki-pagename }}```

1. Click **Continue**. If you export different versions of your note to the same URL in {{ wiki-name }}, the page is overwritten. You can view all versions in the [page history](history.md).
