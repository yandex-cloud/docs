# Creating a page from a file

To convert a TXT text file or DOCX document to a Wiki page:

1. On any page, click **Create** or choose **Actions** â†’ **Create a subpage**.

1. Select **Page**.

1. Set the page title and address the same way as when [creating a normal page](create-page.md).

1. Click **Upload file** and choose the file you want to convert to a page.

1. Click **Create**.

The contents of the selected file will be uploaded to a new Wiki page:

- If you uploaded a TXT file, the text of the file is completely copied to the page. If the text contains [markup elements](basic-markup.md), they will be displayed correctly on the page.

- If you uploaded a DOCX document, the text of the document is converted to [page layout](basic-markup.md). If the document contains images, they are placed at the end of the page in the `<Imported images>` section.
