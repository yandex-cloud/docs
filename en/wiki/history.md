# Viewing the history of page changes

After saving the page, a copy of it is placed in the history of changes. In the history of changes, you can always view previous versions of the page, compare them with each other, or restore any of them.

To view the history of page changes:

1. In the panel on the left, click ![](../_assets/wiki/history-sidebar.png).

1. Select the type of changes you want to view. **Only edits** is displayed by default.

## Viewing an older version of a page {#show-old-page}

Click an entry in the page history. The main window will display the version you select at the top with a caption that says **You're viewing an older version**.

## Comparing versions {#compare-pages}

Select the versions of the page that you want to compare. Their differences will be displayed in the main window.

## Rolling back to an older version {#return-to-old}

1. Click an entry in the page history. The main window will display the version you select at the top with a caption that says **You're viewing an older version**.

1. Select **Return to this version**.

1. You can then edit this version or simply save it without applying any changes, making it the latest current version of the page.
