# History

After saving a page, a copy of it is placed in the change history. In the change history, you can view previous versions of the page, compare them with each other, or roll back to any of them.

To view the history of page changes:

1. In the panel on the left, click ![](../_assets/wiki/history-sidebar.png).

1. Select the type of changes you want to view. **Edits** is displayed by default.

## Viewing an older version of a page {#show-old-page}

Click an entry in the page history. The main window will display the version you select at the top with a caption that says **This is an old version of the page**.

## Comparing versions {#compare-pages}

Select the versions of the page that you want to compare. Their differences will be displayed in the main window.

## Rolling back to an older version {#return-to-old}

1. Click an entry in the page history. The main window will display the version you select at the top with a caption that says **This is an old version of the page**.

1. Select **Edit this version**.

1. You can then edit this version or simply save it without applying any changes, making it the current version of the page.
