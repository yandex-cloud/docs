# Viewing edit history

After you save a page, its copy appears in edit history. You can use the edit history to view all previous versions of a page, compare changes, and roll back to any of the previous versions.

To view a page's edit history:

1. On the left-hand panel, click ![](../_assets/wiki/history-sidebar.png).

1. Select the type of changes you want to view. **Edits** are displayed by default.

## Viewing an older version of a page {#show-old-page}

Select an entry in the page history. The selected version will appear in the main window. At the top of the page, you'll see a caption saying **This is an old version of the page**.

## Comparing two versions of a page {#compare-pages}

Choose the page versions you wish to compare. Their differences will be displayed in the main window.

## Restoring an older version of a page {#return-to-old}

1. Select an entry in the page history. The selected version will appear in the main window. At the top of the page, you'll see a caption saying **This is an old version of the page**.

1. Select **Edit this version**.

1. You can then edit this version or simply save it without applying any changes, making it the latest current version of the page.
