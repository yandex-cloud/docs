# Page types

{{ wiki-full-name }} supports multiple types of pages: You can select a page type when creating your page. However, you won't be able to change it after you save the page.

## Wiki page {#page}

A page with text, images, tables, attached files, and so on. You can add content to your Wiki page in the browser or upload a text file.

* [{#T}](create-page.md)
* [{#T}](import-page.md)

## Note {#note}

A page in your Notes section (`{{ wiki-notes }}`). Notes can only be seen by you by default, but you can always change the access rights.

* [{#T}](create-note.md)

## Dynamic table {#grid}

Dynamic tables are used to sort values, specify data types to display in columns, and set required cells. You can use the table as-is or [embed it on a Wiki page](add-grid.md#grid).

* [{#T}](create-grid.md)
* [{#T}](import-page.md)

{% if audience == "internal" %}

## Visual editor (Wysiwyg) {#wysiwyg}

You can use the visual editor to create a page that doesn't need a special [markup language](static-markup.md) for text formatting (just like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or other common text editors). The visual editor works only on Wysiwyg pages, which are available in the internal Yandex {{wiki-name}}.

* [{#T}](wysiwyg-create.md)
* [{#T}](wysiwyg-edit.md)

## Microsoft Office 365 document {#ms-office}

Office 365 documents stored on the corporate Sharepoint portal or in your personal OneDrive folder.

* [{#T}](office365/ms-office.md)
