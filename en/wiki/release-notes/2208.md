## Retaining the page editor type {#storing-editor-type}

When editing a page, the editor used for its creation opens.

## Viewing the table of contents for Wysiwyg pages {#whysiwyg-page-content}

On a Wysiwyg page using headers of different levels, you can now view the table of contents with the structure of the page. To do this, click ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/ico-toc.svg) in the page header.

## Storing a draft in the Wysiwyg editor {#whysiwyg-storing-a-draft}

If you accidentally close the browser tab with the Wysiwyg page being edited, the changes you made will not be lost and will be saved as a draft instead. To restore the draft, just open the page in the editor and apply the unsaved changes to it.

## Button for accessing your personal cluster {#my-page-button}

The left-hand panel now has the ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/my-page.svg) **My page** button for quick access to your personal cluster.
