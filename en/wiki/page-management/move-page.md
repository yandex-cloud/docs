# Moving a page

You can move a page to another cluster (the page address will change after this). You can only move a page together with its subpages.

To move a page to another cluster, [use the page's actions menu](#move-with-menu) or [move the page in the navigation panel](#move-with-navigation).

Specifics of moving pages:

* If you don't have access to subpages, you can't move a page with its subpages.

* The access rights to a page and subpages are fixed and maintained when moving them.

* Files located on the page are moved to its new address.
