# Moving a page

You can move a page to another cluster (this will change the page address). You can only move a page together with its subpages.

To move a page to another cluster, [use the page's actions menu](#move-with-menu) or [move the page in the navigation panel](#move-with-navigation).

Things to consider when moving pages:

* If you have no access to subpages, you cannot move a page with its subpages.

* The access permission values for the page and its subpages are locked and preserved when moving the page.

* Files located on the page are moved to its new address.

## Moving a page using the menu {#move-with-menu}

1. Open the page.

1. In the top-right corner of the page, click ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/actions-icon.svg) **Actions** and select ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/move-page.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.move }}**.

1. Enter a new page address.

1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.move }}**.

## Moving a page in the navigation panel {#move-with-navigation}

1. In the left part of the [{{ wiki-name }} navigation panel](../navigation.md), click on the page and drag it to another cluster.

1. Click **{{ ui-key.beta-wiki.blocks_common_desktop.blocks_b-editor-struct.page_save }}**.
