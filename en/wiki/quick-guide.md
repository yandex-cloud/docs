To configure access to your page:

1. At the top of the page, click the button that indicates page access (by default **All staff employees**).

1. Select who will be able to view the page:

    - **Same as parent page**: The access level is carried over from the parent page.

    - **All staff employees**: All employees of your organization.

    - **Only authors**: Only the page authors can view and edit the page.

    - **Specific employees**: Specify the usernames of people to grant access to view and edit the page.

    {% note warning %}

    We do not recommend changing access settings for the [{{ wiki-name }} home page]({{ link-homepage }}).

    By default, the author of the {{ wiki-name }} home page is a service account. If "Only authors" access is selected for this page, access for other users will be blocked. To unblock access, click the [{{link-homepage-access}}]({{ link-homepage-access }}) link and change the access parameters.
