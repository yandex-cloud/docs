# Enabling {{ wiki-full-name }}

Users of organizations registered on the {{ yandex-cloud }} platform can use {{ wiki-full-name }} to create a corporate knowledge base. Learn more about the features of {{ wiki-full-name }} in [{#T}](overview.md).

You can connect {{ wiki-full-name }} to an existing organization or create a new one. Read more about organizations in the [{{ org-full-name }} documentation](../organization/).

## Create a new organization {#new-org}

If you don't have an organization in {{ org-full-name}}, you can create a new one when you first log in to {{ wiki-full-name }}.

{% note warning %}

An organization can only be created for users who have a Yandex account.
