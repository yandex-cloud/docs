# Enabling {{ wiki-full-name }}

Users of organizations registered on the {{ yandex-cloud }} platform can use {{ wiki-full-name }} to create a corporate knowledge base. Learn more about the features of {{ wiki-full-name }} in [{#T}](overview.md).

You can connect {{ wiki-full-name }} to an existing organization or create a new one. Read more about organizations in the [{{ org-full-name }} documentation](../organization/index.yaml).

## Activate {{ wiki-name }} in an existing organization {#current-org}

1. Go to the {{ wiki-name }} home page: [{{ link-wiki }}]({{ link-wiki }}).

1. [Log in to the account](login.md) that you use for the organization.

1. If your account is registered in several organizations, select the one where you want to activate {{ wiki-full-name }}. Then click **Continue**.

## Create a new organization {#new-org}

If you don't have an organization in {{ org-full-name}}, you can create a new one when you first log in to {{ wiki-full-name }}.

{% note warning %}

An organization can only be created for users who have a Yandex account.
