# Creating a note

A _note_ is a page in your notes cluster (`{{ wiki-notes }}`). By default, you're the only one who can read your own notes. However, you can change the access settings.

{% if audience == "external" %}

{% note info %}

The maximum number of pages per organization is 10000.

{% endnote %}

{% endif %}

To create a note:

1. On the top panel in {{ wiki-name }} , click **Create**.

1. Select **Note**.

1. Write the text of your note. [Formatting text](basic-markup.md) in notes is similar to formatting that on Wiki pages.

1. Click **Create**
