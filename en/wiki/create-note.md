# Creating notes

A _note_ is a page in your notes section (`{{ wiki-notes }}`). Notes can only be seen by you by default, but you can always change the access rights.

To create a note:

1. In the {{ wiki-name }} upper panel, click **Create**.

1. Select **Note**.

1. Enter your text. You can [format text](basic-markup.md) in notes just like on regular pages.

1. Click **Create**.
