# Creating notes

A _note_ is a page in your Notes section (`{{ wiki-notes }}`). Notes can only be seen by you by default, but you can always change the access rights.

To create a note:

1. In the top {{ wiki-name }} menu, click **Create**.

1. Choose **Note**.

1. Write the note text. You can [format text](basic-markup.md) in the Notes section just like on Wiki pages.

1. Click **Create**
