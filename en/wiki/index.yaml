    Yandex Wiki consists of Wiki pages that can be edited by users. To format
    pages, use the Markdown markup language or a visual editor. Any Wiki user
    can create pages, provide comments, and edit them. All corrections made by
    users are saved in the edit history, so there's no risk of losing something
    important.
