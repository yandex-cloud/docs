# Viewing all links to a page

You can view a list of all pages that link to a certain Wiki page.

This feature allows you to find and remove all the links related to a page you want to delete.

1. Open a page.

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click ![](../_assets/wiki/ico-actions.png) **Action** and choose **Referring pages** or simply write `.referrers` at the end of the page address in your address bar.

1. Wait a few seconds for the data to load.

{% note warning %}

You can't use this method to find the link leading to the page's [anchor](static-markup/links#section-link) rather than the page itself. 

{% endnote %}
