# View all links to the page

You can view a list of all pages linked to the wiki page.

This feature helps you get your page ready for deletion: find and delete all links to it first.

1. Open the page.

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click ![](../_assets/wiki/svg/actions-icon.svg) **Actions** and select ![](../_assets/wiki/svg/delete-page.svg) **Delete**.

1. Wait a few seconds for the data to load.
