# Prohibit page editing

By default, all users who have access to a page can edit it. You can make the page read-only if you are its author:

1. Open the page.

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Actions** and select **Settings**.

1. In the **Page settings** window, enable the option **Only the author can edit the page**. Users who have [access to the page](access-setup.md) will be able to view it, but will not be able to edit it.

    {% note info %}

    The organization admin in [Yandex.Connect]({{ support-admin-connect }}) will be able to edit the page, even if the author has prohibited editing.

    {% endnote %}

1. To prohibit comments on the page, click **Comments**, select **Disabled** and click **Save**.
