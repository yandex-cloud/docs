# Moving pages between clusters

You can change the address of an existing page or move the page to another cluster if necessary. You can move pages one at a time or include subpages.

To move a page to a different cluster, do the following:

1. Open a page.

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Actions** and select **Move** (for dynamic tables ![](../../_assets/wiki/table-settings-footer.png) â†’ **Move**).

1. Set a new page address.

1. If you want to move the page together with all its subpages, choose **Move subpages**.

1. If you want to change the page name, choose **Rename page**.

1. Click **Move**.

Things to note about moving pages:

- If you selected the **Move subpages** option, subpages will be moved even if you don't have access rights to them.

- All access rights to pages and subpages are carried over during the move.

- The old page address will then automatically *redirect* users to the new page.
