# Restricting page view

You can restrict other users' access to a page if you are its author:

1. Open the page.

1. At the top of the page, click the button that specifies access mode for the page (by default **All staff employees**).

1. Specify who will be able to view the page:

   - **Same as the parent page**: The access level is carried over from the parent page.

   - **All staff employees**: All employees of your organization.

   - **Only authors**: Only the page authors can view and edit the page.

   - **Specific employees**: Specify the usernames of people to grant access to view and edit the page.

   {% note alert %}

   We don't recommend changing the access settings for the [{{ wiki-name }} home page]({{ link-homepage }}).

   By default, the author of the {{ wiki-name }} home page is a service account. If "Only authors" access is selected for this page, access for other users will be blocked. To unblock this page, click the [{{ link-homepage-access }}]({{ link-homepage-access }}) link and change the access parameters.

   {% endnote %}

1. Click **Save**.

Users who do not have access to the page will not be able to view or edit it. You can also allow users to view the page, but [prohibit editing](read-only.md).
