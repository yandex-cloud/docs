# Structure of {{ wiki-full-name }}

## Cluster tree {#structure}

{{ wiki-name }} pages are organized in a tree structure:

1. **{{ wiki-host-name }}** â€” {{ wiki-name }} home page. The home page usually displays links to the main clusters, important links, or news.

1. **{{ wiki-host-name }}/page** are top-level pages. Usually these pages share a broad common theme. For example, they can all be related to a single department, team, or project.

    {% note info %}

    The home page is not considered a parent page in relation to top-level pages.

    {% endnote %}

1. **{{ wiki-host-name }}/page/subpage/...** are pages located on the second level or below.

Each page has one or more _owners_, that is, users who manage access to the page. The page owner's name is displayed under the page title.

## Clusters {#clusters}

{{ wiki-name }} pages form _clusters_:

A page with all its subpages together form one cluster. Pages within a cluster are usually related to a common topic.

## Personal cluster {#personal_cluster}

Each {{ wiki-name }} user has their own _Personal cluster_ (`{{ wiki-username }}`). You can use your personal cluster to store personal information, schedule, drafts, and other data. To access your personal cluster, click **My page** in the top {{ wiki-name }} panel. Personal clusters can be viewed by other users by default.

A user's personal cluster contains the Notes section, which is inaccessible to other users (`{{ wiki-notes }}`). You can [create notes](create-note.md) from any {{ wiki-name }} page in just two clicks. To go to the Notes section, click the **Notes** button in the top {{ wiki-name }} panel.

You can [change](page-management/access-setup.md) access rights to pages from your personal cluster and the Notes section, just like with any other page you own.
