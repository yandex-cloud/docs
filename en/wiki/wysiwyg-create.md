# Creating a Wysiwyg page

{% note info %}

You can only use the visual editor with [Wysiwyg pages](pages-types.md#wysiwyg) that are accessible from the internal Yandex {{wiki-name}}.

{% endnote %}

The visual editor is currently in the beta phase, so it may be unstable. Wysiwyg pages have certain limitations:

* They are not compatible with the Wiki markup or [dynamic blocks](actions.md).

* They can't be converted into Wiki pages with the common markup.

* They can't be found via the [intranet search](search.md).

## Creating a page in the visual editor {#create-page-wysiwyg}

To create a page in the Wysiwyg visual editor:

1. In the top {{ wiki-name }} menu, click **Create**.

1. Select **Wysiwyg**.

1. Enter the page name and address in the same way as when [creating a Wiki page](create-page.md).

1. Click **Create**. A new page will open in the visual editor.
