# Customize the appearance of Wiki pages

You can customize the appearance of the Wiki pages you're viewing. These settings only apply to you and do not affect other users.

1. Click your profile picture in the upper-right corner of any Wiki page and select **Settings**.

1. Set the following parameters:
     * **Interface language**. English or Russian.
     * **Code highlighting theme**. Setting a theme for [code blocks](static-markup/highlight) on Wiki pages.
     * **Content translation**. If the **Display** option is selected, you'll see the auto-translation icon to the right of the page heading. Click the icon to translate the page content to different languages.
     * **Limit article width**. The setting is enabled by default: there is a margin between the right edge of the window and the page's body. If you wish to fit the content to the page's width, disable this setting.

1. Click **Save**.
