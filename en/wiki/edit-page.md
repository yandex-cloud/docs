# Editing a Wiki page

You can edit text, add titles and lists, and embed links, images, and tables in a [Wiki page](pages-types.md#page).

You can change any Wiki page that you have [permission to edit](page-management/access-setup.md#read-only):

1. Open the desired Wiki page and click **Edit** in the upper-right corner.

1. Make changes to the text on the Wiki page:

   **Renaming a page**
   * Click on the Wiki page name and enter a new one.

   **Editing and viewing panels**
   * By default, the editing page is divided into two parts: you can edit the text in the left part, and the right part shows how the page will look once it's been saved. To disable previews, click the **Split mode** toggle at the bottom of the page.
   * To open a full-width preview of the page, click **Preview**.

   **Editing text on a page**
   * In page editing mode, you can only add unformatted text. To set the structure and layout of the text, use special characters: the [Markdown markup language](basic-markup.md).
   * To add frequently used formatting elements to the text, use the toolbar at the top of a Wiki page.

   **Attaching files to a page**
   * In the left panel, click ![](../_assets/wiki/attach-btn.png) and upload images or other files to the Wiki page. For example, to [embed an image in the text of a Wiki page](add-image.md).

   **Adding a table**
   * You can embed a [dynamic table](add-grid.md) in a Wiki page. You can sort these tables by column and edit them in page view mode.

   **Adding dynamic blocks**
   * Use [dynamic blocks](actions.md) to add a table of contents, automatically generated lists of pages, items from external resources, and other elements to your Wiki pages.


1. Click **Save**.
   After saving the page, its copy is added to the [history of changes](history.md). In the history, you can always view previous versions of the page, compare them with each other, or restore any of them.

## Editing the {{ wiki-name }} homepage

You can edit the [{{ wiki-name }} homepage]({{ link-wiki }}) just like any other page.

{% note info %}

By default, the author of the {{ wiki-name }} homepage is a service account. If the "Only authors" access type is selected for this page, other users can't access it. To allow others to access the page, click the link [{{ link-homepage-access }}]({{ link-homepage-access }}) and change the access parameters.

{% endnote %}
