# Editing pages

You can edit text, add titles and lists, and insert links, images, and tables on a page.

You can change any Wiki page that you have [editing access](page-managment/read-only.md) to:

1. Open the page and click **Edit** in the upper-right corner.

1. Make changes to the text on the page:

   **Renaming a page**
   - Click the page name and enter a new one.

   **Editing and viewing panels**
   - By default, the editing page is divided into two parts: in the left part you can edit the text, and the right part shows how the page will look once it's been saved. To disable previews, click the **Split mode** toggle at the bottom of the page.
   - To open a full-width preview of the page, click **View** in the upper-right corner.

   **Editing text on a page**
   - In page editing mode, you can only add unformatted text. To set the structure and layout of the text, use special characters: [Markdown markup](basic-markup.md).
   - To add frequently used formatting elements to the text, use the toolbar at the top of the page.
   - You can add [dynamic blocks](actions.md) to the page, such as a [table of contents](add-toc.md) or a list of nested pages.

   **Attaching files to a page**
   - You can [upload images and other files to a page](attach-file.md), for example, to [embed an image into text on the page](add-image.md).

   **Adding a table**
   - You can embed a [dynamic table](add-grid.md) on a page. Such tables can be sorted by columns and edited in page view mode.

1. Click **Save**.

After saving the page, a copy of it is placed in the [change history](history.md). In the change history, you can view previous versions of the page, compare them with each other, or roll back to any of them.

## Editing the {{ wiki-name }} home page

You can edit the {{ wiki-name }} [home page]({{ link-wiki }}) the same as any other.

{% note info %}

By default, the author of the {{ wiki-name }} home page is a service account. If the "Only authors" access is selected for this page, access for other users will be blocked. To unblock it, click the [{{ link-homepage-access }}]({{ link-homepage-access }}) link and change the access parameters.

{% endnote %}
