# Table of contents

You can add a table of contents automatically compiled from page headers to your [Wiki page](../pages-types.md#page). To do this:

1. Make sure the Wiki page headers are [marked up](../basic-markup.md#markup) properly. To quickly view the table of contents for a Wiki page, in the left panel, click ![](../../_assets/wiki/ico-toc.png).
If there are matching headers on the page, the links in the table of contents may not work correctly.

1. Create a table of contents using a dynamic block:

    ```
    not_var{{toc}}
    ```

By default, all the headers of the current Wiki page will be added to the table of contents. You can configure the display of the table of contents using the [advanced parameters](#toc-params).

## Block parameters (optional) {#toc-params}

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `from` | The highest level of headings, which are the first to be included in the table of contents. |
| `to` | The lowest level of headings, which are the last to be included in the table of contents. |
| `page` | A relative address of the table of contents source page. For example: `userName/pageName/`. By default, this is the address of the page where the `toc` section has been added. |
