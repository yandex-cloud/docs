# Issues from {{ tracker-full-name }}

[{{ tracker-full-name }}]({{ link-tracker }}) is a service for managing your projects and activities. Read more about the service features in the [{{ tracker-full-name }} documentation](../../tracker/).

{{ tracker-full-name }} users can place a link to an issue or a list of issues on {{ wiki-name }} pages.

{% if audience == "internal" %}

The way these links look like will change depending on the issue progress, including its assignee, status, and so on.

{% endif %}

## Issue link {#ticket}

You can add _magic links_ to specific issues directly to the [Wiki page text or using the visual editor](../pages-types.md). These links always include the key, name, status of the issue, and the assignee's username. To insert a link to an issue, copy its key and paste it in the text of the page.

Example:

| Markup | Result |
----- | -----
| ``` Fix a mistake in TEST-123 ``` | ![](../../_assets/wiki/tracker-magic-link.png) |

## List of issues {#ticket-list}

Using the `not_var{{tasks}}` block, you can add an automatically generated list of issues to your Wiki page. For example:

```
{{tasks url="URL of the filter or the queue"}}
```

* To display all the issues in the queue, in the `url` parameter, specify its [key](../../tracker/manager/create-queue.md#key) or a link copied from the browser's address bar.

* To display [filtered](../../tracker/user/create-filter.md) issues, in the `url` parameter, specify a link to the filter copied from the browser's address bar.

   {% note info %}

   The `url` parameter of the `tasks` block doesn't support the `"` character. If this character is present in the filter's URL copied from the address bar, replace it with `%22`.

   {% endnote %}

### Issue lists with parameters {#tasks-vars}

Using dynamic tables, you can add a list of issues and their main parameters to your Wiki page:

1. [Create](../create-grid.md) a dynamic table.

1. Create a column with the **Tracker issue** data type.

1. Add the required number of rows and list the issue keys in them.

1. Create additional columns. Specify the necessary issue parameters as the data type. For example, the issue's **Summary**, **Reporter**, or **Type**.

1. Save the table.

As a result, the columns with the issue parameters are filled in automatically. The resulting table can be [embedded in a Wiki page](../add-grid.md).
