# Deleting pages

A page can be deleted by the author or organization's admin in [Yandex.Connect]({{ support-admin-connect }}).

{% note alert %}

Deleting pages is permanent. All information stored on the page will be erased along with the history of changes. If you don't want to delete your page, you can [mark it as outdated](exp-page.md) instead.

{% endnote %}

To delete a page:

1. Open the page.

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Actions** and select **Delete** (for dynamic tables ![](../_assets/wiki/table-settings-footer.png) â†’ **Delete**).

1. Confirm the deletion.

{% note tip %}

You can change the address of your page in {{ wiki-name }}. Instead of deleting and re-creating the page in another cluster, you can [move](page-managment/move-page.md) it.

{% endnote %}
