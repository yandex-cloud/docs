# Deleting a page

A page can be deleted by its author or the administrator of the [organization](overview.md#access).

{% note alert %}

Deleting a page cannot be undone. All information on the page and its history will be erased.

If you want to keep a page that you might need in the future, consider [moving](page-management/move-page.md) it to another cluster instead of deleting it. 

{% endnote %}
