# Deleting pages

A page can be deleted by the page owner {% if audience == "external" %}or the [admin of the organization](overview.md#access){% else %}. If the page owner no longer works at Yandex, send a message to [tools@](mailto:tools@yandex-team.ru). The request will be processed by the internal service support team{% endif %}.

{% note alert %}

Page deletion is permanent and irreversible. All information stored on the page will be erased along with the edit history. Instead of deleting a page, you can [mark it as outdated](exp-page.md).

{% endnote %}

Before deleting a page, check if there are links [leading to it](all-links.md). If there are such links, remove or redirect them so that users aren't directed to <q>Error 404 page. Page not found</q>.

To delete a page:

1. Open the page.

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click ![](../_assets/wiki/ico-actions.png) **Action** and choose **Remove** (for dynamic tables, ![](../_assets/wiki/table-settings-footer.png) â†’ **Remove**).

1. Confirm the deletion.

{% note tip %}

{{ wiki-name }} has a dedicated procedure for changing page address. You can [move](page-management/move-page.md) your page to another cluster instead of deleting and re-creating it in the cluster.

{% endnote %}
