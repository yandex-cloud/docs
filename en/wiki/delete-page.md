# Deleting a page

A page can be deleted by its author {% if audience == "external" %}or the administrator of the [organization](overview.md#access){% else %}. If the author of a page is no longer a Yandex employee, send an email to [tools@](mailto:tools@yandex-team.ru). Your request will be handled by the internal services support team{% endif %}.

{% note alert %}

Deleting a page cannot be undone. All information on the page and its history will be erased.

If you want to keep a page that you might need in the future, consider [moving](page-management/move-page.md) it to another cluster instead of deleting it. {% if audience == "draft" %}You can also [mark your page as outdated](exp-page.md).{% endif %}

{% endnote %}
