# Deleting a page

A page can be deleted by its author or the administrator of an [organization](overview.md#access).

{% note alert %}

Deleting a page cannot be undone. All information on the page and its history will be erased.

If you want to keep a page that you might need in the future, consider [moving](page-management/move-page.md) it to another cluster instead of deleting it. 

{% endnote %}

To delete a page:

1. Open the page.

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click ![](../_assets/wiki/svg/actions-icon.svg) **Actions** and select ![](../_assets/wiki/svg/delete.svg) **Delete**.

1. Check what pages link to the page being deleted and, if necessary, delete or replace the links.

1. Confirm the deletion.
