# Deleting a page

A page can be deleted by its author {% if audience == "external" %}or the administrator of the [organization](overview.md#access){% else %}. If the author of a page is no longer a Yandex employee, send an email to [tools@](mailto:tools@yandex-team.ru). Your request will be handled by the internal services support team{% endif %}.

To delete a page:

1. Open the page.

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click ![](../_assets/wiki/svg/actions-icon.svg) **Actions** and select ![](../_assets/wiki/svg/delete-page.svg) **Delete**.

1. Check what pages link to the page being deleted and, if necessary, delete or replace the links.

1. Confirm deletion.

{% note tip %}

You can change the address of your page in {{ wiki-name }}. Instead of deleting and recreating the page in another cluster, you can [relocate](page-management/move-page.md) it.

{% endnote %}
