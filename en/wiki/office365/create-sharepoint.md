# Creating an Office 365 document on Sharepoint

If you want to embed a document to be viewed and edited on a Wiki page, [make sure you create the document in the interface {{wiki-name}}](create-ms-office.md#new-from-wiki).

If you prefer to manage documents in Office 365, you'll still be able to embed your documents on Wiki pages. You can [create documents on the Sharepoint site](#create-sharepoint) so that other users can access them.

{% note alert %}

To create and edit embedded cloud documents, you must be [logged in to office.com](#office-login). If you don't have an Office 365 license, send a request via this [form](https://help.yandex-team.ru/?form=soft).

## Creating a shared document {#create-sharepoint}

If you want all internal Yandex employees to have access to the document by default, create the document on the corporate Sharepoint portal. On the portal, you can create a folder for your project or department and use it to store documents for public use. To keep the storage space neat and tidy, avoid creating documents in the root folder.

1. Go to the [Sharepoint portal]({{link-sharepoint-common}}).

1. Open your department or project folder. If there is no such folder, you can create a new one.

1. Above the file list, click **+ Create** and select the document type. An empty document will then open in a new tab.

1. Edit the document. To rename it, click on the document's name on the top panel.

You can also upload a document from your computer to Sharepoint. In the folder, click **Send** → **Files**.

## Creating a restricted document {#create-private}

If you want to create a document that will only be accessed by you or several of your colleagues, you can create one in your [personal OneDrive folder]({{link-sharepoint-personal}}).

By default, all documents created in Office 365 are saved in your personal folder:

1. Go to [Office 365 home page](https://www.office.com/).

1. Select an application.

1. Create and edit the document. To rename it, click on the document's name on the top panel.

1. By default, the created document is only available to you. To make the document available to other users, [configure its access rights](doc-access.md#access-list).

You can also upload the document to your personal OneDrive folder:

1. On the Office 365 home page, select OneDrive or [follow the link]({{link-sharepoint-personal}}).

1. Click **Send** → **Files** above the file list.

1. To make the document available to other users, [configure its access rights](doc-access.md#access-list).
