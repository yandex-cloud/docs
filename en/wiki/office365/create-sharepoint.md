If you plan to embed a document in a Wiki page and then read and edit this document on the page, [create a document through the {{wiki-name}}](create-ms-office.md#new-from-wiki) interface.

If you prefer to work with documents in Office 365, you can also embed your documents in Wiki pages. In this case, you can [create documents on a Sharepoint shared website](#create-sharepoint) so that other users have access to the documents.

## Creating a shared document {#create-sharepoint}

If you want all Yandex full-time employees to have access to a document by default, create a document on the Sharepoint corporate portal. You can create a folder for your project or department there and store work materials to be shared in it. To maintain order in the repository, don't create documents in the root directory.

1. Go to the [Sharepoint portal]({{link-sharepoint-common}}).

1. Open the folder of your department or project. If there is no such folder, you can create one.

1. Click **+ Create** above the list of files and select the document type. An empty document opens in a new tab.

1. Edit the document. To rename it, click on the document name in the top panel.

You can also upload a document from your PC to Sharepoint. To do this, click **Send** → **Files** in the folder.

## Creating a document with restricted access {#create-private}

If you want to create a document that will only be available to yourself or a few colleagues, you can create one in your [OneDrive personal folder]({{link-sharepoint-personal}}).

By default, all documents created in Office 365 applications are saved in your personal folder:

1. Go to the [Office 365 homepage](https://www.office.com/).

1. Select an application.

1. Create and edit a document. To rename it, click on the document name in the top panel.

1. By default, the created document is only available to you. To make the document available to other users, [configure access rights](doc-access.md#access-list).

You can also upload documents to your OneDrive personal folder:

1. On the Office 365 homepage, select the OneDrive app or [follow the link]({{link-sharepoint-personal}}).

1. Above the list of files, click **Send** → **Files**.

1. To make the document available to other users, [configure access rights](doc-access.md#access-list).
