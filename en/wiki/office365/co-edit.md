# Co-editing documents

Office 365 lets you co-edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents: multiple users can make simultaneous edits to a document and save them. You can also use this feature in cloud documents embedded in Wiki pages: when editing a cloud document, it opens in the Office 365 app and you can co-edit it with other users.

## Editing a document embedded in a Wiki page {#edit-button}

To edit an Office 365 document embedded in a Wiki page, click **Edit in cloud** in the upper-right corner. The document opens in a new tab in the Office 365 app.

If you have no permission to edit the document, you'll see a message saying "You have no access to this page". To request access to the document from its author, write your message and click **Access request**.

{% note alert %}

To edit documents, [sign in to office.com](ms-office.md#office-login). If you don't have an Office 365 license, send a request via the [form](https://help.yandex-team.ru/?form=soft).

### How to start co-editing documents using {{ wiki-name }} {#shared-edit}

When writing a document, you often need to make simultaneous edits to it and receive comments from your colleagues.

You can embed cloud documents in {{ wiki-name }} end co-edit them with your teammates:

* If you have ready-made Office 365 documents that you collaborate on with your colleagues, continue working on them in {{ wiki-name }}. To do this, create a page of the **Word, Excel, PowerPoint** type and [import your file](create-ms-office.md#import-doc).

* If you're co-editing a page on {{ wiki-name }} with your colleagues, [create a new cloud document](create-ms-office.md#new-from-wiki) and copy and paste the page text in it.

### How to co-edit a document with external users {#shared-edit-ext}

If you often need to collaborate on documents with contractors who are not Yandex employees, you can grant them access to co-edit documents in Office 365. To do this, [create a SharePoint site](./create-sharepoint.md#shared-site) and invite external users.

To send an invitation to external users you want to collaborate on a document with:
1. Find the desired document on your SharePoint site that external users are allowed to access.

1. Hover over the document, click ![](../../_assets/wiki/share-opt.png =20x), and select **Manage Access**.

1. In the pane that opens, under **Direct Access**, enter the email address of the external user to grant document access to, and select the **Can edit** permission level.

1. Click **Grant Permissions**.

1. A message with a link is sent to the user's email address you specified. Once the user follows the link, they're sent a code they need to enter to access the document.
