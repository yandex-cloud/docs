# Co-editing documents

In Office 365, you can collaborate with other users when editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents. The documents can be edited and saved by multiple users at once. This feature is also available in cloud documents embedded on Wiki pages. Cloud documents open in Office 365 applications, so you can edit them simultaneously with other users.

## Editing a document embedded on a Wiki page {#edit-button}

To edit an Office 365 document embedded on a Wiki page, click **Edit in cloud** in the upper-right corner. The document will open in an Office 365 application in a new tab.

If you don't have editing rights for the document, the message "You do not have access to this page" will appear instead. To request access to the document from its owner, enter your message and click **Request access**.

{% note alert %}

To edit documents, you must be [logged in to office.com](ms-office.md#office-login). If you don't have an Office 365 license, send a request via this [form](https://help.yandex-team.ru/?form=soft).

### How to switch to shared document editing using {{wiki-name}} {#shared-edit}

Working with documents, you may often need to co-edit and receive comments from several colleagues.

In the past, we used to send a document over by mail and then combine the edits from different versions of the document. Or we could create a page on {{wiki-name}} and take turns editing the document.

Today, you can embed cloud documents on {{wiki-name}} and edit them simultaneously with your colleagues:

* If you already have Office 365 documents that you co-edit with your colleagues, you can simply continue using {{wiki-name}}. To do this, create a **Word, Excel, or PowerPoint** page and [import your file](create-ms-office.md#import-doc).

* If you co-edit a page on {{wiki-name}}, [create a new cloud document](create-ms-office.md#new-from-wiki), copy the text from the page you edit, and paste it into the new document.

### Co-editing documents with external users {#shared-edit-ext}

If you often need to co-edit documents with external contractors, you can provide them with shared editing access to your Office 365 files. Since our security policies prohibit external users from accessing the Sharepoint portal, you will have to create a separate Sharepoint website (section) that will be accessible to users outside Yandex.

To do this:

1. Send a request to `help@yandex-team.ru`: specify that your team or department requires a new Sharepoint site for sharing documents with external users. In your message, clarify why you require this type of access.

1. After HelpDesk employees set up the site, you'll be able to [create new documents](create-sharepoint.md#create-sharepoint) or [move existing documents](doc-access.md#move-doc) there from other Sharepoint pages.

1. To invite external users for collaborative document editing:
   1. Find a document on your Sharepoint site that is accessible to external users.
   1. Hover your cursor over the document and click ![](../../_assets/wiki/share-opt.png) and choose **Manage access**.
   1. In the panel that opens, find the **Direct access** block, enter the email address of the external user you wish to share the document with, and set the access level to **Can make edits**.
   1. Click **Grant access**.
   1. The user will receive a link to the email address you specified. After clicking the link, the user will receive a code by email. They will need to enter the code to access the document.
