# Solving issues with access to online documents

## You are not logged in to the Office 365 portal {#no-login}

Instead of the document, you'll see a button for [logging in to the portal](ms-office.md#office-login). If you don't have an Office 365 license, send a request via this [form](https://help.yandex-team.ru/?form=soft).

## No access to a Wiki page {#no-access-wiki}

You'll see a message with code 403. To request access from the page owner, write your message in the **Request access** field and click **Send**.

## No access to a Sharepoint document {#no-access-sharepoint}

If the document was created in the Sharepoint interface, you'll receive a message saying that the Wiki page access settings are not applicable. At the top of the page, click **Request access from page owner**, write the message, and click **Request access**.

## Cross-site tracking restricted in browser {#crossite-tracking}

{{wiki-name}} uses cross-site tracking cookies to access cloud documents on the Office 365 portal. To view cloud documents on Wiki pages, [disable the tracking restrictions](cross-site-tracking.md).
