# Troubleshooting issues accessing online documents

## You haven't logged in to the Office 365 portal {#no-login}

Instead of a document, you'll see a button to [log in to the portal](ms-office.md#office-login). If you don't have an MS Office 365 license, submit a request using the [form](https://help.yandex-team.ru/?form=soft).

## No access to a Wiki page {#no-access-wiki}

You'll see an error message with the code 403. To request access from a page author, write a message in the **Application for granting access** field and click **Submit**.

## No access to a Sharepoint document {#no-access-sharepoint}

If a document is created through the Sharepoint interface, a message appears saying that the Wiki page access settings are not valid. At the top of the page, click **Request access from author**, write a message, and click **Access request**.

## The browser blocks cross-site tracking {#crossite-tracking}

{{wiki-name}} uses cross-site tracking cookies to access cloud documents on the Office 365 portal. To view cloud documents on Wiki pages, [disable the ban on tracking actions](cross-site-tracking.md).
