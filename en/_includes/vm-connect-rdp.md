Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with Network Level Authentication (NLA) is enabled for images of all versions and editions of the Windows operating system prepared for {{ yandex-cloud }}. Before connecting to a VM, make sure that NLA is enabled in your desktop settings. When the VM starts (its status is `RUNNING`), you can connect to it using RDP.

[Make sure the VM's security groups](../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) allow incoming TCP traffic to port 3389.

  {% include [security-groups-note](../compute/_includes_service/security-groups-note.md) %}

To connect using RDP, specify the public IP address or the FQDN of the VM. Access using FQDN is possible from another {{ yandex-cloud }} VM if it's connected to the same network. You can find out the IP address and FQDN in the management console. Go to the **Network** section on the virtual machine's page.

To connect to the VM:
