Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with Network Level Authentication (NLA) is enabled for images of all versions and editions of the Windows operating system prepared for {{ yandex-cloud }}. Before connecting to a VM, make sure that NLA is enabled in your desktop settings.

You can connect to a virtual machine with the `RUNNING` status over RDP. Some time may be required to initialize all the services after the VM [starts](../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-stop-and-start.md#start). If there is a connection error, retry after a few minutes.

Virtual machine [security groups](../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) must allow incoming TCP traffic to port 3389.

{% include [security-groups-note-vm](vpc/security-groups-note-vm.md) %}

To connect using RDP, specify the public IP address or the FQDN of the VM. Access using FQDN is possible from another {{ yandex-cloud }} VM if it is connected to the same network. You can find out the IP address and FQDN in the management console. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instance.overview.section_network }}** section on the virtual machine's page.
