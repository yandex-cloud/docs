Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is enabled for images of all versions and editions of the Windows operating system prepared for {{ yandex-cloud }}. You can connect to a VM via RDP when the VM is running (its status is `RUNNING`).

To connect using RDP, specify the public IP address or the FQDN of the VM. Access via FQDN is possible from another {{ yandex-cloud }} VM if it's connected to the same network. You can find out the IP address and FQDN in the management console. Go to the **Network** section on the virtual machine's page.
