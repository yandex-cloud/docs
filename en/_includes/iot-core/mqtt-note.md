{% note important %}

No additional settings are required for working with the MQTT broker integrated in the YC CLI (`yc iot mqtt --help`). If you use third-party libraries or applications (such as Mosquitto) as an MQTT broker, use the [MQTT broker connection parameters](../../iot-core/concepts/mqtt-properties.md).
