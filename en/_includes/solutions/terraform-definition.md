[With Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), you can quickly create a cloud infrastructure in {{ yandex-cloud }} and manage it using configuration files. They store the infrastructure description in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

If you change the configuration files, Terraform automatically determines which part of your configuration is already deployed and what should be added or removed.
