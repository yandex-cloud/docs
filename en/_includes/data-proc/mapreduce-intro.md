[MapReduce](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/MapReduceTutorial.html) is a parallel processing tool for large datasets (a few dozen TB or more) on clusters in the Hadoop ecosystem. It allows you to work with data in different formats. Job input and output are stored in {{ objstorage-full-name }}. MapReduce uses a number of libraries, while [Apache Bigtop](https://github.com/apache/bigtop) determines the path to them.
