If an argument, a variable, or a property consists of several parts separated by a space, specify each part as a separate argument, variable, or property.

For example, the `-mapper mapper.py` argument must be converted into two arguments: `-mapper` and `mapper.py` next to each other.

For this reason, it's important to maintain the order of declaring arguments, variables, and properties. Otherwise, jobs won't start.
