   To cancel a job, run the command below:

   You can retrieve a job name or ID in the [list of cluster jobs](#list), and a cluster name in the [list of folder clusters](../../data-proc/operations/cluster-list.md#list).

* API

   Use the API [cancel](../../data-proc/api-ref/Job/cancel) method and pass in in the call:

   * The cluster ID in the `clusterId` parameter.
   * The job ID in the `jobId` parameter.

   You can retrieve a cluster ID in the [list of folder clusters](../../data-proc/operations/cluster-list.md#list), and a job ID in the [list of cluster jobs](#list).
