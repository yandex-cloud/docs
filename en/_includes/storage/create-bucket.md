- Management console
  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you want to create a [bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) name.
  1. Select **{{ objstorage-name }}**.
  1. Click **Create bucket**.
  1. On the bucket creation page:
      1. Enter the bucket name, following the [naming guidelines](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md#naming).
      1. If necessary, limit the maximum bucket size.

         {% include [storage-no-max-limit](../../storage/_includes_service/storage-no-max-limit.md) %}

      1. Select the type of [access](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md#bucket-access).
      1. Select the default [storage class](../../storage/concepts/storage-class.md).
      1. Click **Create bucket** to complete the operation.

- {{ TF }}

  If you don't have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

  Before you start, get [static access keys](../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md): a private key and key ID used for authentication in {{ objstorage-short-name }}.

  1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:

     * `access_key`: The ID of the static access key.
     * `secret_key`: The value of the private access key.
     * `bucket`: The name of the bucket being created. Optional parameter. If omitted, a random unique bucket name is generated.

     Example configuration file structure:

     {% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

     ```
     provider "yandex" {
       token     = "<OAuth>"
       cloud_id  = "<cloud ID>"
       folder_id = "<folder ID>"
       zone      = "{{ region-id }}-a"
     }
     
     resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "test" {
       access_key = "<static key identifier>"
       secret_key = "<secret key>"
       bucket = "<bucket name>"
     }
     ```

     {% endif %}

     {% if product == "cloud-il" %}

     ```
     provider "yandex" {
       endpoint  = "{{ api-host }}:443"
       token     = "<static key of the service account>"
       cloud_id  = "<cloud ID>"
       folder_id = "<folder ID>"
       zone      = "{{ region-id }}-a"
     }

     resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "test" {
       access_key = "<static key identifier>"
       secret_key = "<secret key>"
       bucket = "<bucket name>"
     }
     ```

     {% endif %}

     For more information about the resources you can create using {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}).

  1. Make sure that the configuration files are correct.

     1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
     1. Run the check using the command:
        ```
        terraform plan
        ```

     If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal displays a list of created resources and their parameters. If there are errors in the configuration, {{ TF }} points them out.

  1. Deploy the cloud resources.

     1. If the configuration doesn't contain any errors, run the command:
     ```
     terraform apply
     ```
     1. Confirm that you want to create the resources.

     Afterwards, all the necessary resources are created in the specified folder. You can check resource availability and their settings in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
