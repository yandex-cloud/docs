The minimum role required to create a bucket is `storage.editor`. See the [role description](../../storage/security/#storage-editor).

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you want to create a [bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md).
   1. Select **{{ objstorage-name }}**.
   1. Click **Create bucket**.
   1. On the bucket creation page:
      1. Enter the bucket name, following the [naming guidelines](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md#naming).

         By default, a bucket with a dot in the name is only available over HTTP. To provide HTTPS support for your bucket, [upload your own security certificate](../../storage/operations/hosting/certificate.md) to {{ objstorage-name }}.

      1. If necessary, limit the maximum bucket size.

         {% include [storage-no-max-limit](../../storage/_includes_service/storage-no-max-limit.md) %}

      1. Select the type of [access](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md#bucket-access).
      1. Select the default [storage class](../../storage/concepts/storage-class.md).
      1. Click **Create bucket** to complete the operation.

- {{ TF }}

   If you do not have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   Before you start, retrieve the [static access keys](../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md): a secret key and a key ID used for authentication in {{ objstorage-short-name }}.

   1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:

      * `access_key`: The ID of the static access key.
      * `secret_key`: The value of the secret access key.
      * `bucket`: The name of the bucket being created. Optional parameter. If omitted, a random unique bucket name is generated.

      
      ```
      provider "yandex" {
        token     = "<OAuth>"
        cloud_id  = "<cloud ID>"
        folder_id = "<folder ID>"
        zone      = "{{ region-id }}-a"
      }

      resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "test" {
        access_key = "<static key ID>"
        secret_key = "<secret key>"
        bucket = "<bucket name>"
      }
      ```



      For more information about resources that you can create with {{ TF }}, please see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/).

   1. Make sure that the configuration files are correct.

      1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run the check using the command:
         ```
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal displays a list of created resources and their parameters. If there are errors in the configuration, {{ TF }} points them out.

   1. Deploy the cloud resources.

      1. If the configuration doesn't contain any errors, run the command:
         ```
         terraform apply
         ```

      1. Confirm that you want to create the resources.

      Afterwards, all the necessary resources are created in the specified folder. You can check that the resources are there with the correct settings using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
