{% note info %}

In {{ yandex-cloud }} terminology, we use the _label_ concept to denote logical resource labeling. However, as {{ objstorage-name }} is compatible with [Amazon S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html), in the [AWS CLI](../../storage/tools/aws-cli.md) commands and [API](../../storage/s3/) parameters, we use _tag_, which is a term native to AWS.
