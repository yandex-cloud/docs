### Question ID {#id}

Use the question ID for [pre-filling forms](../../forms/pre-fill.md).

You can edit the ID. All questions in the same form must have unique IDs.

In the ID you can use uppercase and lowercase letters in the Latin alphabet, numbers, symbols `-` and `_`.

### Required prompt {#required}

Turn this option on to mark required prompts with an <q>asterisk</q>. If the user doesn't respond to this prompt, they can't submit the completed form.

### Hidden question {#hidden}

Turn on this option if you don't want to show a prompt on the form. You can use hidden questions for [sending technical parameters](../../forms/pre-fill.md#hidden-query).

{% note warning %}

Don't turn on **Hidden question** and **Required prompt** at the same time, otherwise users won't be able to submit the completed form.

{% endnote %}
