{{ yandex-cloud }} services provide a variety of interfaces for implementing your projects. Usually, {{ yandex-cloud }} services have a web interface in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or within their installations, such as [{{ datalens-full-name }}]({{ link-datalens-main }}) and [{{ ml-platform-full-name }}]({{ link-datasphere-main }}). In addition, they have interfaces designed to automate processes: [API](../../api-design-guide/), [CLI](../../cli/), Terraform, and SDKs for different programming languages. You can find information about the provided interfaces in the respective service documentation.

The {{ yandex-cloud }} documentation contains step-by-step instructions for working with different interfaces. Sample CLI commands and API requests usually use the Bash syntax. You can run them as is in the Linux console, macOS terminal, or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) in Windows 10 and higher.

If you use {{ yandex-cloud }} in Windows with no WSL, sample CLI commands and API requests may run incorrectly. To use the examples given in the documentation, install the Bash interface on your PC, [create a VM](../../compute/operations/vm-create/create-linux-vm.md) to work with {{ yandex-cloud }}, or adapt commands to the syntax of the Windows command shell you use. For more information Windows command shells, see the official Microsoft documentation.
