If an organization with an activated support service plan uses resources paid from different billing accounts, the percentage part of the plan will be charged to each billing account according to the cost of consumed resources. The fixed part will be paid by only one account: the one specified when selecting the **{{ ui-key.support-center.tariff-plans.tariff-card.title_business }}** service plan. When you change your plan, you can choose the billing account to be used to cover the fixed portion of the plan. This option is only available to the organization owner. To change your billing account:

1. In the **{{ ui-key.support-center.common.plans }}** window, click **{{ ui-key.support-center.billing-account.common.action_edit }}** to select another account.
1. In the **{{ ui-key.support-center.billing-account.common.title_billing-account }}** window, specify another account using one of the following methods:
    * Select an account from the list.
    * Create a new account.

Service plan upgrades are effective immediately; downgrades take effect on the first day of the following month. For information on current service plans and examples of how to calculate your costs, see [Pricing policy](../../support/pricing.md).
