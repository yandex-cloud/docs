For [asynchronous recognition](../../{{ speechkit-slug }}/stt/transcribation.md), a language model that can operate in two modes is available:
1. In standard mode, recognition is processed in a standard priority queue. This mode works when the `general` model is selected.
1. In deferred mode, the audio file to be recognized is placed in a low priority queue and processed at the least busy time. [Special pricing](../../{{ speechkit-slug }}/pricing.md#prices-stt) applies to deferred recognition. The time required to process an audio file in deferred mode is 24 hours or less. Recognition in deferred mode is only available with [API v2](../../speechkit/stt/api/transcribation-api.md) when the `deferred-general` tag is specified.
