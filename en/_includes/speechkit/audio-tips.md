## General recommendations for audio recording {#audiotips}

Noise and echo during recording directly affect the quality of training and performance of your speech synthesis model. For this reason, when recording audio for training and fine-tuning your model or patterns for synthesis, try to reduce sound reflection in the room. A perfect place for recording is a room equipped with acoustic panels. If recording in a household environment, you can reduce the echo with soft surfaces and furniture, such as carpet, upholstered sofa, etc.

When recording any audio intended for your speech synthesis model, use the "one phrase per file" rule.

No inaccuracies, micro repeats, reservations, and word substitutions are allowed. Any speech defects in the recordings made for synthesis models substantially degrade the quality of the synthesized speech.

Each recording of a pattern or phrase for model training must have an absolutely accurate text transcript. Patterns, training phrases, and their transcripts must not contain grammatical errors.
