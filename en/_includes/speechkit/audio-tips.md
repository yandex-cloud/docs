## General recommendations for audio recording {#audiotips}

Noise and echo during recording directly affect the quality of training and performance of your speech synthesis model. For this reason, when recording audio for training and fine-tuning your model or patterns for synthesis, try to reduce sound reflection in the room. A perfect place for recording is a room equipped with acoustic panels. If recording in a household environment, you can reduce the echo with soft surfaces and furniture, such as carpet, upholstered sofa, etc.

Use equipment that has the same settings and location for any audio recording.

Make sure the sound engineer, speaker, and voice coach are different people. A voice coach is a professional who makes sure the speaker strictly follows the text without changing the manner of narration.

When recording any audio intended for your speech synthesis model, use the _one phrase per file rule_.

No inaccuracies, micro repeats, reservations, and word substitutions are allowed. Any speech defects in the recordings made for synthesis models substantially degrade the quality of the synthesized speech.

Each recording of a pattern or phrase for model training must have an absolutely accurate text transcript. Patterns, training phrases, and their transcripts must not contain grammatical errors.
