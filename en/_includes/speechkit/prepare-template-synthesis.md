To prepare a template:

1. Make an audio recording of your pattern phrase.
1. Mark up the text of the pattern phrase following the [requirements](../../speechkit/tts/templates.md#requirements) and enclose the variable parts in `{}` (curly brackets).

   Sample markup:
   > This is to remind you that a garbage truck will arrive at your place {tomorrow} at {two pm}.
   >

1. For each variable part, set its start time and duration in the audio recording (in milliseconds).
