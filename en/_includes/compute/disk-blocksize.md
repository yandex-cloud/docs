Disks consist of blocks. By default, the block size of all created disks is 4 KB, but that's not enough for disks larger than 8 TB. You can set the block size when creating an empty disk. You can't change the block size after the disk is created.

The maximum disk size depends on the chosen block size.

| Block size | Maximum disk size |
| ---- | ---- |
| 4 KB | 8 TB |
| 8 KB | 16 TB |
| 16 KB | 32 TB |
| 32 KB | 64 TB |
| 64 KB | 128 TB |
| 128 KB | 256 TB |
