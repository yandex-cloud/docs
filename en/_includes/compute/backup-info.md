(optional) To automatically back up your instances using [{{ backup-name }}](../../backup/), under **Backup**, select the option of connecting an instance to the service.

The option shows up if you requested access to the service from our [technical support]({{ link-console-support }}/create-ticket) and selected a supported operating system for your VM. For more information about setting up a VM, see [{#T}](../../backup/concepts/vm-connection.md).
