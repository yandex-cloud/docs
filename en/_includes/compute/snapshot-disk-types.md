You can only create snapshots of replicated network disks. To work with [non-replicated and high-performance disks](../../compute/concepts/disk.md#disks_types) and disks residing in [dedicated hosts](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md), use [{{ backup-full-name }}](../../backup/). This service is currently at the Preview stage and supports Ubuntu, CentOS, and Windows Server.
