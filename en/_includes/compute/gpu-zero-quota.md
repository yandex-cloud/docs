By default, the cloud has a zero [quota](../../compute/concepts/limits.md#compute-quotas) for creating VMs with GPUs. You can request to increase the quota in the [management console]({{ link-console-support }}). To do this, you need the `quota-manager.requestOperator` [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#quota-roles) or higher.
