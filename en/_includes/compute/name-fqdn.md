{% note info %}

The VM name is used one time only when creating a VM, to generate the FQDN. If the FQDN is important to you, choose an appropriate name for the virtual machine at the creation stage. For more information about generating the FQDN, see [{#T}](../../compute/concepts/network.md#hostname).
