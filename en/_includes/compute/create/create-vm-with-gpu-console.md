To create a VM:

1. In the [management console](https://console.cloud.yandex.com), select a folder to create a VM in.

1. In the list of services, select **{{ compute-name }}**.

1. Click **Create VM**.

1. Under **Basic parameters**:

    - Enter a name and description for the VM.

        {% include [name-fqdn](../name-fqdn.md) %}

    - (optional) Select or create a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md). By using a service account, you can flexibly configure access rights for your resources.

    - Select the [availability zone](../../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to host the VM in.

1. Select one of the GPU-oriented images and OS version under **Public images** .

   {% include [gpu-os](../gpu-os.md) %}

1. (optional) Configure the boot disk under **Disks**:
      - Specify the necessary disk size.
      - Select the [disk type](../../../compute/concepts/disk.md#disks_types).
If you want to create an instance from an existing disk, go to **Disks** [add a disk](../../../compute/operations/vm-create/create-from-disks.md).

1. Under **Computing resources**:
    - Choose the [platform](../../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md#gpu-platforms) Intel Broadwell with NVIDIA Tesla v100.
    - Choose the [configuration](../../../compute/concepts/gpus.md#config) of the virtual machine by specifying the required number of GPUs.
    - If necessary, make your VM [preemptible](../../../compute/concepts/preemptible-vm.md).

1. Under **Network settings**:
    - Specify the subnet ID or select a [cloud network](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) from the list. If you don't have a network, click **Create a new network** to create one:
        - In the window that opens, enter a name for the new network and choose a subnet to connect the virtual machine to. Each network must have at least one [subnet](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) (if there's no subnet, create one). Then click **Create**.
    - In the **Public IP** field, choose a method for assigning an IP address:
        - **Auto**: Assign a random IP address from the Yandex.Cloud IP pool.
        - **List**: Select a public IP address from the list of previously reserved static addresses. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../vpc/operations/set-static-ip.md).
        - **No address**: Don't assign a public IP address.
    - (optional) Enable [DDoS protection](../../../vpc/ddos-protection/).

1. Under **Access**, specify the data required to access the VM:

    - Enter the username in the **Login** field.

      {% note alert %}

      Don't use the username `root` or other names reserved by the operating system. To perform operations that require superuser permissions, use the command `sudo`.

      {% endnote %}

    - In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the [public key file](../../../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md#create-ssh).

1. Click **Create VM**.

The virtual machine appears in the list. When a VM is being created, it is assigned an [IP address](../../../vpc/concepts/address) and [hostname](../../../vpc/concepts/address#imya-hosta-(fqdn)) (FQDN).
