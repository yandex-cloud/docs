To create a VM:
1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder to create the virtual machine in.
1. In the list of services, select **{{ compute-name }}**.
1. ClickÂ **Create VM**.
1. Under **Basic parameters**:
   * Enter a name and description for the VM. Naming requirements:

      {% include [name-format](../../name-format.md) %}

      {% include [name-fqdn](../name-fqdn.md) %}

   * Select an [availability zone](../../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to put your virtual machine in.

1. Under **Image/boot disk selection**, click the **{{ marketplace-name }}** tab and select a GPU-oriented [image](../../../compute/operations/images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md) and an operating system version.

   {% include [gpu-os](../gpu-os.md) %}

1. (optional) Under **Disks and file storage**, configure a boot disk:
   * Select the [disk type](../../../compute/concepts/disk.md#disks_types).
   * Specify the necessary disk size.

1. (optional) Under **Disks and file storage**, select the **File storage** tab, connect a [file store](../../../compute/concepts/filesystem.md), and enter the device name.

1. Under **Computing resources**:
   * Choose a [platform](../../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md#gpu-platforms):
      * {{ v100-broadwell }}.
      * {{ v100-cascade-lake }}.
      * {{ a100-epyc }}.
   * Select a virtual machine [configuration](../../../compute/concepts/gpus.md#config) specifying the required number of GPUs.
   * If necessary, make your VM [preemptible](../../../compute/concepts/preemptible-vm.md).

1. Under **Network settings**:
   * Enter a subnet ID or select a [cloud network](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) from the list.
      If you don't have a network, click **Create network** to create one:
      * In the window that opens, enter the network name and folder to host the network.
      * (optional) To automatically create subnets, select the **Create subnets** option.
      * Click **Create**.
         Each network must have at least one [subnet](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet). If there is no subnet, create one by selecting **Add subnet**.
   * In the **Public IP** field, choose a method for assigning an IP address:
      * **Auto**: Assign a random IP address from the {{ yandex-cloud }} IP pool. With this, you can enable [DDoS protection](../../../vpc/ddos-protection/index.md) using the option below.
      * **List**: Select a public IP address from the list of previously reserved static addresses. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../vpc/operations/set-static-ip.md).
      * **No address**: Don't assign a public IP address.
   * In the **Internal address** field, select the method for assigning internal addresses: **Auto** or **Manual**.
   * (optional) Create a record for the VM in the [DNS zone](../../../dns/concepts/dns-zone.md). Expand the **DNS settings for internal addresses** section, click **Add record** and specify the zone, FQDN and TTL for the record. For more detail, please see [Cloud DNS integration with Compute Cloud](../../../dns/concepts/compute-integration.md).
   * Select [appropriate security groups](../../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) (if there is no corresponding field, the virtual machine will be enabled for all incoming and outgoing traffic).

1. Under **Access**, specify the data required to access the VM:
   * (optional) Select or create a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/index.md#sa). By using a service account, you can flexibly configure access rights for your resources.

      For VMs with a Linux-based operating system:
      * Enter the username in the **Login** field.
   
      {% note alert %}
   
      Don't use the username `root` or other names reserved by the operating system. To perform operations that require superuser permissions, use the command `sudo`.
   
      {% endnote %}
   
      * In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the [public key](../../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys) file.

      For VMs with a Windows-based operating system:
      * When you create a VM, the `Administrator` user is automatically created in the operating system. In the **Password** field, set a password for this user to log in to the VM via RDP.
   
         {% include [password-requirements](../password-requirements.md) %}
   
      * (optional) If necessary, enable access to the [serial console](../../../compute/operations/index.md#serial-console).

1. Click **Create VM**.
