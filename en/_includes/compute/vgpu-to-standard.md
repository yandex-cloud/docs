{{ yandex-cloud }} is deprecating vGPUs. Starting July 1, 2022, you will no longer be able to create VMs with vGPUs. Before August 1, 2022, users who have VMs with vGPUs will have to [migrate them to other platforms](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-update-resources.md), such as those with [GPUs](../../compute/concepts/gpus.md#gpu), or stop using them.
