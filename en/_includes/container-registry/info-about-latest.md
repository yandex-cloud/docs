{% note warning %}

The tag `latest` **doesn't mean** that the Docker image was the latest one pushed.

{% endnote %}

We don't recommend overwriting tags. Use a unique tag for each Docker image version. This way you can use the same Docker image version on all your VMs with identical specifications and more easily identify causes of problems.
