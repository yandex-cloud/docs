* `description`: Description of the policy rule.
* `tag_regexp`: Docker image tag for filtering.
* `untagged`: Flag indicating that the rule applies to Docker images without tags.
* `expire_period`: Time after which the lifecycle policy may apply to the Docker image.
    Parameter format: Number and unit of measurement `s`, `m`, `h`, or `d` (seconds, minutes, hours, or days). `expire_period` must be a multiple of 24 hours.
* `retained_top`: Number of Docker images that are not deleted even if they match the rule.
