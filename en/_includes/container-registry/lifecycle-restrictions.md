{% note warning %}

You can only set a lifecycle policy for [a repository](../../container-registry/concepts/repository.md). The policy applies to Docker images whose names match the repository name exactly. There is no support for prefix matching. You can't set a policy for a repository group, registry, folder, or cloud.
