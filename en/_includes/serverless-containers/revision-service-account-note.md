To create a revision, you must make the [registry](../../container-registry/concepts/registry.md) or the [repository](../../container-registry/concepts/repository.md) containing the Docker image [public](../../container-registry/qa/index.md#public-registry) or set the revision settings to the [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) [authorized](../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md) to download a Docker image. For example, the `container-registry.images.puller` role to the folder or registry containing the Docker image.
