To better safeguard your resources from unauthorized access, we recommend enabling Yandex ID [two-factor authentication](https://yandex.com/support/passport/authorization/twofa.html) in Yandex.Passport. Use this method to secure your own account and ask every user you add to your cloud to enable two-factor authentication as well.
