To add [federated users](../../organization/add-federation.md), you need to know the users' Name IDs returned by the Identity Provider (IdP) server with the successful authentication response. This is usually the user's primary email address. If you don't know what the server returns as the Name ID, contact the administrator who configured authentication for your federation.
