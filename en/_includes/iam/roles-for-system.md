You can assign any role to the system group, except `resource-manager.clouds.owner` and `resource-manager.clouds.member`.

{% note alert %}

Do not assign a system group the `editor` or `admin` role for a catalog or cloud. Otherwise, anyone who knows the folder ID can use {{ yandex-cloud }} at your expense.
