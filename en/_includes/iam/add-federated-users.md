If you enabled the **Automatically create users** option when creating an identity federation, this step is optional. If you didn't enable it, you must add users to the cloud manually.

To add identity federation users to the cloud:

1. [Open Access management page]({{ link-console-access-management }}) in the management console.

1. Click **Add user**.

1. Select the identity federation to add users to.

1. List the Name IDs of users, separating them with line breaks.

    Specify the Name IDs returned by the Identity Provider (IdP) on successful authentication. These may be UPNs or user email addresses.
