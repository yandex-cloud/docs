#### storage.uploader {#storage-uploader}

Users with the `storage.uploader` role can upload [objects](../../../storage/concepts/object.md) to a [bucket](../../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) and overwrite previously uploaded ones. They can also view a list of bucket objects and download them, since the `storage.uploader` role inherits the permissions of the `storage.viewer` role.

This role does not allow you to delete objects or configure buckets.
