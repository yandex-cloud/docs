As with other services, you can assign roles for [clouds](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) and [service accounts](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md). The roles assigned for clouds and folders also apply to nested resources.
