You can assign a role to an [organization](../../organization/concepts/organization.md), [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), or [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder). The roles assigned for organizations, clouds, or folders also apply to nested resources.
