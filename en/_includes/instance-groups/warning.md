{% note warning %}

When creating a group, keep the [limits](../../compute/concepts/limits.md) in mind. Not to disrupt the component {{ ig-name }}, do not update or delete manually created resources: [target group](../../load-balancer/concepts/target-resources.md) {{ load-balancer-name }}, virtual machines and disks. To do this, update or delete the instance group.
