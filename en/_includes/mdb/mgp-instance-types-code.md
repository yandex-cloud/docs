* **s2**, **s3**: Standard configurations with 4 GB:1 RAM-to-vCPU ratio.
* **i2**, **i3**: Configurations with 8 GB:1 RAM-to-vCPU ratio. These configurations are well suited for clusters with high cache requirements. Hosts with this configuration run in a [software-accelerated network](../../vpc/concepts/software-accelerated-network.md), which substantially affects [cluster costs](../../managed-greenplum/pricing/index.md#prices-hosts).
