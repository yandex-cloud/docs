- **Backup start time (UTC)**: UTC time in 24-hour format when you would like to start creating a cluster backup. If the time is not set, the backup will start at 22:00 UTC.

- **Retention period for automatic backups, days**: The period to store the automatically created backups. If an automatic backup expires, it is deleted. The default is {{ mpg-backup-retention }} days. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../managed-postgresql/concepts/backup.md).

   Changing the retention period affects both new automatic backups and existing backups. For example, the initial retention period was 7 days. The remaining lifetime for a backup with this period is 1 day. When the retention period increases to 9 days, the remaining lifetime for this backup is 3 days.

   Automatic cluster backups are stored for a specified number of days whereas manually created ones are stored indefinitely. After a cluster is deleted, all backups persist for 7 days.

- **Autofailover**: Enable this option so that when the master host changes, the replication source for every replica host is automatically switched over to the new master host. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../managed-postgresql/concepts/replication.md).

   If the master host [is deleted](../../../managed-postgresql/operations/hosts.md#remove), a new master will be selected automatically regardless of the value of this option.

   {% note alert %}

   If the **Autofailover** option is disabled, run the selection of a new master or assign this role to one of the replicas [manually](../../../managed-postgresql/operations/update.md#start-manual-failover) if the master host fails.
