Under **Host class**, select:

* One of the available [platforms](../../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md)
* Configuration type: **memory-optimized**, **standard**, or **burstable**.
* [Host class](../../../managed-mongodb/concepts/instance-types.md): Defines the technical specifications of the VMs where the DB hosts will be deployed. When you change the host class for the cluster, the characteristics of all existing hosts change, too.
