   * **Min part size**: Minimum size (in bytes) of a [data part](https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/operations/table_engines/mergetree/#mergetree-data-storage) in a table. {{ CH }} only applies the rule to tables with data parts greater than or equal to the **Min part size** value.
   * **Min part size ratio**: Minimum ratio of table part size to total table size. {{ CH }} only applies the rule to tables in which this ratio is greater than or equal to the **Min part size ratio** value.

   You can add multiple compression rules. {{ CH }} checks the **Min part size** and **Min part size ratio** conditions and applies the rules to those tables that meet both of them. If multiple rules can be applied to the same table, {{ CH }} applies the first one. If none of the rules are applicable, {{ CH }} uses the LZ4 compression method.

   To learn more, see the [{{ CH }} documentation](https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/operations/server_settings/settings/#compression)

  * **Name**: Configuration name.
  * **Patterns**: Set of thinning rules. A rule applies if the metric name matches the **Regexp** parameter value and the age of the data matches the **Retention** parameter group value.
     * **Function**: Aggregation function name.
     * **Regexp**: Regular expression that the metric name must match.
     * **Retention**: Retention parameters. The function applies to data whose age is in the range of [Age, Age + Precision]. You can set several groups of these parameters.
       * **Age**: Minimum data age, in seconds.
       * **Precision**: Accuracy of determining the age of the data, in seconds. Must be a divisor of 86,400 (the number of seconds in 24 hours).

  You can set up multiple configurations and use them for different tables.

* **Kafka**{#setting-kafka} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-tf }}

    - `PLAIN`: Authentication [using the "username-password" pair passed as plain text](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_plain).
    - `SCRAM-SHA-256` and `SCRAM-SHA-512`: Authentication [using the SCRAM family mechanisms](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_scram).

  * **Sasl username**: Username of an {{ KF }} account.
  * **Security protocol**: Security protocol used for authentication:
    * `PLAINTEXT`: Authentication credentials are sent as plain text.
    * `SSL`: Authentication credentials are sent with SSL encryption.
    * `SASL_PLAINTEXT`: Authentication credentials are sent as plain text with SASL transport.
    * `SASL_SSL`: Authentication credentials are sent with SSL encryption and SASL as transport.

  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ KF }}](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security).

* **Kafka topics**{#setting-kafka-topics} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-tf }}

  If a table run on the [Kafka engine](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/integrations/kafka/) has no authentication data found for the topic, the global settings from the **Kafka** section are used.

  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ KF }}](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security).

* **Merge tree**{#setting-merge-tree} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-api }} {{ tag-tf }}

  * **Max replicated merges in queue**: Maximum number of merge tasks that can be in the `ReplicatedMergeTree` queue at the same time.
  * **Number of free entries in pool to lower max size of merge**: Threshold value of free entries in the pool. If the number of entries in the pool falls below this value, {{ CH }} reduces the maximum size of a data part to merge. This helps handle small merges faster, rather than filling the pool with lengthy merges.
  * **Parts to delay insert**: Number of active data parts in a table. When exceed, {{ CH }} starts artificially reducing the rate of inserting data into the table.
  * **Parts to throw insert**: Threshold value of active data parts in a table. When exceeded,{{ CH }} throws the 'Too many parts ...' exception.
  * **Replicated deduplication window**: Number of recent hash blocks that {{ ZK }} stores (old ones are deleted).
  * **Replicated deduplication window seconds**: Time during which {{ ZK }} stores hash blocks (old ones are deleted).
