{% note info %}

Public access to cluster hosts is required if you plan to connect to the cluster via the internet. This connection option is simpler and is recommended for the purposes of this guide. You can connect to non-public hosts as well but only from {{ yandex-cloud }} virtual machines located in the same cloud network as the cluster.
