{% note tip %}

If you can't request public access to the hosts (for example, for security reasons), you can use Kibana by proxying the connections via the virtual machine in {{ compute-full-name}} that is hosted in the same [network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) as the cluster. For more information, see [{#T}](../../managed-elasticsearch/operations/cluster-connect.md).
