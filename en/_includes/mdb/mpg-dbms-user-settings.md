- **Conn limit**{#setting-conn-limit} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-api }} {{ tag-cli }}

  Maximum allowed number of connections for the user.

  In transaction pooling, this setting limits the number of simultaneous connections per user transaction. When using this type of pooling, the user can open thousands of connections, but only `N` connections can run concurrently (where `N` is the setting value).

  In session pooling, the setting limits the number of user connections to each host in a {{ PG }} cluster. When using this type of pooling, make sure the setting value is not less than the sum of all connections that can be opened by the user service backends. Each open server connection somewhat slows down the {{ PG }}  OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) performance.

  The following principles apply to session pooling:

  - When adding a user, {{ mpg-name }} reserves 50 connections per host in a {{ PG }} cluster by default. The minimum number of connections per user is 10.
  - The total number of connections reserved for users must not exceed the value of the parameter [Max connections](../../managed-postgresql/concepts/settings-list.md#setting-max-connections). {{ mpg-name }} reserves 15 service connections per host.

    For example, if the cluster has the setting "`max_connections": 100`, you can reserve a maximum of 85 connections per cluster host for users.

  - We recommend that you distribute different services that use {{ PG }} among different users and set the desired value for each user. If issues in one service lead to the creation of a large number of connections, other services aren't affected and can connect to {{ PG }}.

  The setting [depends on the selected host class](#settings-instance-dependent).

- **Default transaction isolation**{#setting-user-default-transaction-isolation} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-api }} {{ tag-cli }}

  See the [Default transaction isolation](#setting-default-transaction-isolation) cluster-level setting.

- **Lock timeout**{#setting-user-lock-timeout} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-api }} {{ tag-cli }}

  See the [Lock timeout](#setting-lock-timeout) cluster-level setting.

- **Log min duration statement**{#setting-user-log-min-duration-statement} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-api }} {{ tag-cli }}

  See the [Log min duration statement](#setting-log-min-duration-statement) cluster-level setting.

  We recommend that you define what you mean by slow query execution for each service and its user and log only such queries. For example, for a web service, a query is considered slow if it runs for more than one second, while for the reporting service, a query that runs for more than 10 minutes is slow.

  For more information, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html).

- **Log statement**{#setting-user-log-statement} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-api }} {{ tag-cli }}

  See the [Log statement](#setting-log-statement) cluster-level setting.

- **Login**{#setting-user-login} {{ tag-api }} {{ tag-cli }}

  Determines if the user can connect to a {{ PG }} cluster.

  Defaults to `true` (the user can connect to the cluster).

- **Synchronous commit**{#setting-user-synchronous-commit} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-api }} {{ tag-cli }}

  See the [Synchronous commit](#setting-synchronous-commit) cluster-level setting.

- **Temp file limit**{#setting-temp-file-limit} {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-api }} {{ tag-cli }}

  See the [Temp file limit](#setting-temp-file-limit) cluster-level setting.
