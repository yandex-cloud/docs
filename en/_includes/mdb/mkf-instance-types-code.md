Configuration types:

* **s2**, **s3**: Standard configurations with a 4:1 RAM-to-vCPU ratio.
* **m2**, **m3**: Configurations with an increased RAM-to-vCPU ratio (8:1). These configurations are well suited for clusters with high cache requirements.
* **b2**, **b3**: Configurations with a guaranteed vCPU share under 100%. This host class is intended for test workloads. The minimum recommended host configuration for production solutions is two vCPUs with a guaranteed share of 50%.
