Data on cluster and host states are available in the management console. You can view them on the **Monitoring** tab of the {% if audience != "internal" %} cluster management page or in [{{ monitoring-full-name }}](../../monitoring/concepts/index.md){% endif %}.

Diagnostic information about cluster states is presented as graphs.
