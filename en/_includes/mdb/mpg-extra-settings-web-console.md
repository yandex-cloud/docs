- **Backup start time (UTC)**: UTC time when you want to start creating a cluster [backup](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-backups.md) (in 24-hour format). If the time is not set, the backup will start at 22:00 UTC.

- **Retention period for automatic backups, days**: The period to store the automatically created backups. If an automatic backup expires, it is deleted. The default is {{ mmg-backup-retention }} days. This feature is in the [Preview stage](../../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md). For more information, see [{#T}](../../managed-postgresql/concepts/backup.md).

   Changing the retention period affects both new automatic backups and existing backups. For example, the initial retention period was 7 days. The remaining lifetime for a backup with this period is 1 day. When the retention period increases to 9 days, the remaining lifetime for this backup is 3 days.
