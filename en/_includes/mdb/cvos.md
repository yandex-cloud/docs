You can get a guaranteed discount on service resource usage when you plan for six months or one year ahead. To see the resources you can get a discount on:

1. Go to [Billing]({{ link-console-billing }}).
1. Click on the desired billing account.
1. Choose **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.switch_offers }}** in the left-hand menu.

A CVoS guarantees a discount on usage, but doesn't guarantee the availability of the resources ordered.  Read more about CVoS in the [Billing documentation](../../billing/concepts/cvos.md).
