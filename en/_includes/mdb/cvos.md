You can get a guaranteed discount on service resource usage when you plan for six months or one year ahead. To see the resources you can get a discount on:

1. Go to [**{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.label_service }}**]({{ link-console-billing }}).
1. Click on the desired billing account.
1. Choose **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.switch_offers }}** in the left-hand menu.

A CVoS guarantees a discount on usage, but does not guarantee the availability of the resources ordered. You can read more about CVoS in the [{{ billing-name }} documentation](../../billing/concepts/cvos.md).
