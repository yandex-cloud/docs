{% note warning %}

Starting April 11, 2024, support for {{ mes-full-name }} will be discontinued.

Users who have not yet worked with {{ ES }} in the cloud will not be able to create new clusters starting July 20, 2023. Current service users will be able to use existing clusters and create new ones.


You can [create {{ OS }} clusters](../../../managed-opensearch/operations/cluster-create.md) in {{ yandex-cloud }} as an alternative to {{ ES }} and [transfer data](../../../managed-elasticsearch/tutorials/migration-to-opensearch.md) from existing {{ ES }} clusters to {{ mos-name }}.
