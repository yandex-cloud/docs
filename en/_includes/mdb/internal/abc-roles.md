Special ABC roles are supported for accessing MDB clusters and hosts:

* The _MDB administrator_ role lets you create, modify, and delete entities (clusters, hosts, users, and so on) and get information about them.
* The _MDB user_ role only lets you get information about entities: view the cluster list, logs, monitoring charts, and so on.

{% note warning %}

The process of role synchronization from ABC is not very fast right now. It can take up to an hour and a half from the moment the role is issued to the moment the access becomes available.
