Special ABC roles are supported for accessing MDB clusters and hosts:

* The _MDB administrator_ role lets you create, modify, and delete entities (clusters, hosts, users, and so on) and get information about them.
* The _MDB user_ role only lets you get information about entities: view the cluster list, logs, monitoring charts, and so on.

{% note warning %}

Syncing roles from ABC is not fast right now. It can take up to 4 hours from the time the role is granted until access is available.
