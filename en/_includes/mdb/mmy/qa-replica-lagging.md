#### Replica lagging {#replica-lagging}

1. Check to see that `slave_rows_search_algorithms` is set to `INDEX_SCAN,HASH_SCAN`.
1. Instead of `ALTER TABLE` statements, we recommend using the `pt-online-schema-change` utility from the Percona Toolkit on large tables to avoid locking.
1. If the lag persists, enable parallel replication. To do this, configure the following parameters:
   ```
   slave_parallel_type=LOGICAL_CLOCK
   slave_parallel_workers=8
   ```
1. Run the `SHOW SLAVE STATUS;` command against the replica. If the value of `Executed_Gtid_Set` remains unchanged for a long time, make sure that all the tables have indexes.
1. If data is being continuously written to the DB, and the host has 8GB or more of RAM, we recommend increasing `innodb_log_file_size` to 1 or 2 GB (parameter updates apply on server restart).
