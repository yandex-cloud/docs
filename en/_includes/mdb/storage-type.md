During cluster creation you can choose between the following storage types:

* Standard network storage (`network-hdd`) — the cheapest option, for clusters with moderate requirements to IOPS.
* Fast network storage (`network-ssd`) — a compromise option: slower than local storage, but, as opposed to local disks, guarantees data safety when Yandex.Cloud servers are out of commission.
* Fast local storage (`local-ssd`) — the fastest option. Local storage can only be increased in 100 GB intervals.
