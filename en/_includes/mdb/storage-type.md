When creating a cluster, you can choose between the following storage types:

* Standard network storage (`network-hdd`): The cheapest option for servers with relaxed read/write performance requirements.
* Fast network storage (`network-ssd`): A middle-ground solution. It's slower than local storage, but unlike local disks, it ensures data integrity if {{ yandex-cloud }} hardware goes down.
* Fast local storage (`local-ssd`): The fastest disks. The size of local storage can only be incremented by 100 GB.
