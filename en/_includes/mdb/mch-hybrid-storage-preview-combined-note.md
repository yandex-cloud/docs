{% note info %}

Hybrid storage is at the [Preview](../../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage. Using [{{ objstorage-name }}](../../storage) is free of charge.

Hybrid storage is only available in clusters with standard (`network-hdd`) or fast (`network-ssd`) network storage and [disabled fault tolerance](../../managed-clickhouse/operations/zk-hosts.md). This type of storage can be accessed upon request. Contact [support](../../support/overview.md) or your account manager.
