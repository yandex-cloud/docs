  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ MY }}](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_io_capacity).

- **Innodb io capacity max**: The maximum number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) available to all InnoDB background tasks. If a host's flushing activity falls behind, InnoDB may start flushing data to disk at a higher rate of IOPS than defined by the [Innodb io capacity](#setting-innodb-io-capacity) setting but within the specified maximum number of IOPS.

  The minimum value is `100` and the maximum value is `100000`. Defaults to `2000`.

  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ MY }}](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_io_capacity_max).

- **Innodb lock wait timeout**: The maximum time (in seconds) an InnoDB transaction waits for a row lock. When a lock wait timeout occurs, an error is returned and the current SQL statement is rolled back (**not** the entire transaction).

  You might decrease this value for OLTP systems and interactive user applications. You might increase this value for long-running operations in an application, such as a transform step for a large array of data in a data warehouse that waits for large `INSERT` or `UPDATE` queries to finish.

  The minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `28800` (480 minutes, or 8 hours). Defaults to `50`.

- **Innodb log file size**: The size of a single InnoDB redo log file (in bytes). The larger the value, the less [checkpoint](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_checkpoint) flush activity is required in the buffer pool, saving disk I/O. At the same time, larger log files make crash recovery slower.

  The minimum value is `268435456` (256 MB) and the maximum value is `4294967296` (4 GB). Defaults to `268435456` (256 MB).

- **Innodb print all deadlocks**: Controls writing information about all [deadlocks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-deadlocks.html) to the error log. If disabled, you see information about only the last deadlock, using the `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` command.

  By default, the option for showing information about all deadlocks is off.

  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ MY }}](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_print_all_deadlocks).

- **Innodb purge threads**: The number of InnoDB I/O threads used for [purge operations](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_purge).

- **Sql mode**: {{ MY }} server SQL modes:

  - [ALLOW_INVALID_DATES](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_allow_invalid_dates): Do not perform full checking of dates. In this mode, the server checks that the month is in the range from 1 to 12 and the day is in the range from 1 to 31. Invalid dates like `2004-04-31` are converted to `0000-00-00` and a warning is returned.

  - [ANSI_QUOTES](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_ansi_quotes): Treat `"` as an identifier quote character and not as a string quote character. With this mode enabled, use single quotes `'` instead of doubles `"` for strings.

  - [ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_error_for_division_by_zero): Division by zero returns `NULL` and a warning. This SQL mode is deprecated.

  - [HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_high_not_precedence): The precedence of the `NOT` operator is higher when parsing Boolean expressions. With this mode enabled, an expression like `NOT a BETWEEN b AND c` is parsed as `(NOT a) BETWEEN b AND c` instead of `NOT (a BETWEEN b AND c)`.

  - [IGNORE_SPACE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_ignore_space): Permits spaces between a function name and the opening bracket `(`. As a result, built-in function names are treated as keywords. Identifiers that are the same as function names must be quoted.

  - [NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_auto_value_on_zero): Only `NULL` inserted into `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns generates the next sequence number for the column. Normally, new sequence numbers are generated when inserting either `0` or `NULL` into it. So this mode can be useful if you need to explicitly store `0` in this column.

  - [NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_backslash_escapes): Disables the use of the backslash character (`\`) as an escape character. With this mode enabled, backslash is treated as an ordinary character.

  - [NO_DIR_IN_CREATE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_dir_in_create): When creating a table, ignore all `INDEX DIRECTORY` and `DATA DIRECTORY` directives.

  - [NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_engine_substitution): Do not use the default storage engine automatically and return an error if the `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` statement specifies an engine that is unavailable.

  - [NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_unsigned_subtraction): A negative result is allowed when using subtraction between integer values, one of which is unsigned.

  - [NO_ZERO_DATE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_zero_date): Affects whether the server permits `0000-00-00` as a valid date: {#setting-no-zero-date}
    - If [strict SQL mode](#setting-strict-mode) is disabled, `0000-00-00` is permitted and inserting it produces a warning.
    - If strict SQL mode is enabled, `0000-00-00` is not permitted. If you try to insert it, an error occurs.

    This SQL mode is deprecated.

  - [NO_ZERO_IN_DATE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_zero_in_date): Affects the use of dates in which the month or day is zero:
    - If [strict SQL mode](#setting-strict-mode) is disabled, dates with zero parts are inserted as `0000-00-00` with a warning returned.
    - If strict SQL mode is enabled, dates with zero parts are not permitted. If you try to insert them, an error occurs.

    This SQL mode is deprecated.

    See also: [NO_ZERO_DATE](#setting-no-zero-date).

  - [ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_only_full_group_by): Reject queries in which `SELECT`, `HAVING`, or `ORDER BY` refer to nonaggregated columns that are not named in the `GROUP BY` clause (standard [SQL-92](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-by-handling.html)).

  - [PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_pad_char_to_full_length): `CHAR` column values are padded with spaces to their full length. This does not apply to `VARCHAR` columns.

  - [PIPES_AS_CONCAT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_pipes_as_concat): Treat `||` as a string concatenation operator (same as [CONCAT()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-functions.html#function_concat)) rather than a synonym for [OR](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/logical-operators.html#operator_or).

  - [REAL_AS_FLOAT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_real_as_float): Treat `REAL` as a synonym for `FLOAT` (by default, {{ MY }} treats `REAL` as a synonym for `DOUBLE`).

  - [STRICT_TRANS_TABLES](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_strict_trans_tables): Enable [strict SQL mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sql-mode-strict) for all transactional storage engines and, when possible, for nontransactional storage engines. {#setting-strict-mode}

  - [TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_time_truncate_fractional): Enables truncation of a fractional part when inserting a `TIME`, `DATE`, or `TIMESTAMP` value into a column that has fewer fractional digits (by default, {{ MY }} uses rounding instead of truncation).

  - [ANSI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_ansi): A combination of the following modes:
    - `REAL_AS_FLOAT`.
    - `PIPES_AS_CONCAT`.
    - `ANSI_QUOTES`.
    - `IGNORE_SPACE`.
    - `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`.

  - [TRADITIONAL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_traditional): A combination of the following modes:
    - `STRICT_ALL_TABLES`.
    - `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`.

  By default, the following set of SQL modes is used:
  - `ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`.
  - `NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION`.
  - `NO_ZERO_DATE`.
  - `NO_ZERO_IN_DATE`.
  - `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`.
  - `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`.

- **Sync binlog**: Determines how often the binary log is synchronized to disk:
  - `0`: Synchronization is disabled. The {{ MY }} server relies on the operating system to flush the binary log to disk from time to time as it does for any other file. This method provides the best performance. However, data might be lost in the event of a power failure or operating system crash: transactions might be committed before they're synced to the binary log.
  - `1`: The binary log is synced to disk before transactions are committed. This is the safest method, but it may have a negative impact on performance due to the increased number of disk writes. In the event of a power failure or operating system crash, transactions that are missing from the binary log are in a prepared state. This lets you perform automatic recovery and roll back the transactions, which guarantees that no transaction is lost from the binary log.
  - `N`: The binary log is synchronized to disk after collecting `N` commit groups for the binary log. In the event of a power failure or operating system crash, transactions might be committed before they're synced to the binary log. This method may have a negative impact on performance due to the increased number of disk writes. The higher the `N` value, the better the performance and the higher the risk of data loss.

  The minimum value is `0` and the maximum value is `4096`. Defaults to `1`.

- **Table definition cache**: The number of table definitions that can be stored in the definition cache. If your database has a large number of tables, increase this value to speed up opening of tables.

  The minimum value is `400` and the maximum value is `524288`. Defaults to `2000`.

  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ MY }}](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_table_definition_cache).

- **Table open cache**: The size of the open tables cache for all threads. If the value of [Opened tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-status-variables.html#statvar_Opened_tables) is large and you don't use [FLUSH_TABLES](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/flush.html#flush-tables) often, increase the value of this setting. {#setting-table-open-cache}

  Increasing it requires increasing the number of file descriptors for the {{ MY }} server.

  The minimum value is `400` and the maximum value is `524288`. Defaults to `4000`.

  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ MY }}](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_table_open_cache).

- **Table open cache instances**: To improve scalability, the [open tables cache](#setting-table-open-cache) can be partitioned into smaller segments. This value sets the number of such cache instances.

  The minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `32`. Defaults to `16`.

  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ MY }}](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_table_open_cache_instances).

- **Thread cache size**: The number of threads that are cached to handle new connections. When establishing a new connection, threads from the cache are reused first and only then new threads are created. Increase this value to improve performance if you have a lot of new connections.

  The minimum value is `10` and the maximum value is `10000`. Defaults to `10`.

  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ MY }}](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_cache_size).

- **Thread stack**: The stack size (in bytes) for each thread. The default value is large enough for normal operation of the {{ MY }} server. If the thread stack size is too small, it limits the complexity of SQL statements, the recursion depth of stored procedures, and other memory-consuming actions.

  The minimum value is `131072` (128 KB) and the maximum value is `16777216` (16 MB). Defaults to `196608` (192 KB).

  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ MY }}](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_thread_stack).

- **Tmp table size**: The maximum size of in-memory temporary tables (in bytes). If a table exceeds this limit, it's converted to an on-disk temporary table. This setting doesn't affect user-created MEMORY tables. Increase this value if you run many advanced `GROUP BY` queries and your cluster hosts have enough RAM. {#setting-tmp-table-size}

  The minimum value is `1024` (1 KB) and the maximum value is `134217728` (128 MB). Defaults to `16777216` (16 MB).

  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ MY }}](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_tmp_table_size).

- **Transaction isolation**: The default transaction isolation level:
  - `READ-COMMITTED`: A query only sees the strings that were committed before it is run.
  - `REPEATABLE-READ`: All queries in the current transaction only see the strings that were committed before the first query to select and update data that was executed in this transaction.
  - `SERIALIZABLE`: Same as `REPEATABLE-READ`, except that InnoDB implicitly converts `SELECT` statements to `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` if the [autocommit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_autocommit) mode is disabled. If autocommit is on, a `SELECT` is executed in its own transaction in `read only` mode and can be serialized.

  For more information, see the [documentation for {{ MY }}](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_transaction_isolation).
