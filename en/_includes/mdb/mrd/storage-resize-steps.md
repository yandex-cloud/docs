If the specified threshold is reached, the storage size increases differently depending on disk type:

* For network SSDs, by the higher of the two values: 20 GB or 20% of the current disk size.
* For non-replicated SSDs and ultra high-speed network SSDs with three replicas, by 93Â GB.
* For local SSDs:

    * **Intel Broadwell** and **Intel Cascade Lake**, by 100 GB.
    * **Intel Ice Lake**, by {{ local-ssd-v3-step }}.

If the threshold is reached again, the storage size will be automatically increased until it reaches the specified maximum. After that, you can specify a new maximum storage size manually.
