This is a special user that is required for managing clusters and cannot be deleted. It is assigned the `superuser` role and can perform any operations on clusters.

{% note tip %}

To perform routine tasks, we recommend creating individual users. For more information, see [{#T}](../../managed-elasticsearch/operations/cluster-users.md).
