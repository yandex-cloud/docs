When creating a cluster, you can select the following disk types for data storage:

* Network HDD storage (`network-hdd`): the cheapest option for clusters with relaxed read/write performance requirements.
* Network SSD storage (`network-ssd`): a middle-ground solution - it's slower than local SSD storage, but unlike local disks, it ensures data integrity if {{ yandex-cloud }} hardware goes down.
* Non-replicated SSD storage (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`): Network SSD storage with enhanced performance that is implemented by eliminating redundancy.

   The storage size can only be increased in increments of 93 GB.

* Local SSD storage (`local-ssd`): The fastest disks.

   The size of such storage can be increased:
   {% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}*For **Intel Cascade Lake**: Only in increments of 100 GB.{% endif %}
   * For **Intel Ice Lake**: In {{ local-ssd-v3-step }} increments only.
