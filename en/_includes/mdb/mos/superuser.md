`admin` is a dedicated user required to manage the cluster and cannot be deleted. Such a user has the `superuser` role and can perform any operations with the cluster.

{% note tip %}

However, for routine jobs, we recommend creating individual regular users. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../managed-opensearch/operations/cluster-users.md).
