{% note tip %}

You can use {{ OS }} Dashboards even if you can't request public access to the hosts (for example, for security reasons). To do this, proxy the connections via the virtual machine in {{ compute-full-name }} that is hosted in the same [network](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) as the cluster. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../managed-opensearch/operations/connect.md#dashboards).
