{% note tip %}

You can use {{ OS }} Dashboards even if you cannot get public access to your hosts, e.g., for security reasons. To do this, proxy the connections via the virtual machine in {{ compute-full-name }} that resides in the same [network](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) as the cluster. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../managed-opensearch/operations/connect.md#dashboards).
