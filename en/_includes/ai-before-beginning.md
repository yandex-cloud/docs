To use the examples, install [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se) and get the authorization data for your account:

{% list tabs %}

- User's account on Yandex
  1. [On the billing page]({{ link-console-billing }}), make sure that your [billing account](../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) status is `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE`. If you don't have a billing account, [create one](../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
  1. [Get an IAM token](../iam/operations/iam-token/create.md) required for authentication.
  1. [Get the ID of any folder](../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) that your account is granted the `editor` role or higher for.

- Service accounts

  1. Select the authentication method:

     * Get an [IAM token](../iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-sa.md) used in the examples.

     * [Create an API key](../iam/operations/api-key/create.md). Pass the API key in the `Authorization` header in the following format:

          ```
          Authorization: Api-Key <API key>
          ```

  1. [Assign the ](../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md) `editor` role or a higher role to the service account for the folder where it was created.

      Don't specify the folder ID in your requests: the service uses the folder where the service account was created.

- Federated account

  1. [Authenticate with the CLI as a federated user](../cli/operations/authentication/federated-user.md).

  1. Use the CLI to get an [IAM token](../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md) required for authentication:

      ```bash
      $ yc iam create-token
      ```

  1. [Get the ID of any folder](../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) that your account is granted the `editor` role or higher for.
