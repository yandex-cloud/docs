{% note info %}

Some apps designed to work with Amazon S3 do not allow you to specify the region; this is why [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../storage/) also accepts the value of the primary AWS region — [the first row in the region table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-regions.html#available-regions).
