{% note info %}

Some apps designed to work with Amazon S3 do not allow you to specify the region; this is why [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../storage/) may also accept the main AWS region value, which is the [first row in the table of regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-regions.html#available-regions).
