Read and write operations utilize the same disk resource. The more read operations you do, the fewer write operations you can do, and vice versa. For more information, see [{#T}](../compute/concepts/storage-read-write.md).

^4^ To achieve maximum IOPS, we recommend performing read and write operations whose size is close to that of the disk block (4 KB by default).

^5^ To achieve the maximum possible bandwidth, we recommend performing 4 MB reads and writes.
