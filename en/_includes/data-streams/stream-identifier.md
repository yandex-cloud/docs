Data streams are created based on {{ ydb-full-name }} and are stored in databases.

`A stream ID` is composite and consists of a **folder ID**, {{ ydb-short-name }} **database ID**, and **stream name**.

For example, `aoeu1kuj2dhtaupdb5es/cc8028jgtuabcqutgtbv/stream1` identifies the `aoeu1kuj2dhtaupdb5es` folder, the {{ ydb-short-name }} `cc8028jgtuabcqutgtbv` database, and the `stream1` stream.
