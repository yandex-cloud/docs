## 25/12/2025: CVE-2025-14847 (MongoBleed) Reading uninitialized memory in zlib {#CVE-2025-14847}

CVE ID: CVE-2025-14847

CVE link: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14847>

### Original report {#original-report}

<https://github.com/joe-desimone/mongobleed>

### Summary {#brief-description}

The {{ MG }} Server’s zlib implementation has a vulnerability which an external client can exploit by tricking the server to return uninitialized heap memory. During zlib decompression, {{ MG }} may use the length of the allocated buffer rather than the actual length of decompressed data.
Therefore, the server treats the entire buffer as valid data, including the uninitialized part. Thus, by artificially inflating `uncompressedSize`, an attacker can gain access to out-of-scope data. This vulnerability may be exploited remotely and without authentication, which means sensitive data may get leaked.

Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### Recommendations for vulnerability detection and supporting materials {#recommendations-for-vulnerability-detection}

* Upgrade immediately to one of these versions: 8.2.3 / 8.0.17 / 7.0.28 / 6.0.27 / 5.0.32 / 4.4.30 (or higher).

* If upgrading is not possible, use this workaround: disable zlib compression on `mongod/mongos` by specifying `networkMessageCompressors` or `net.compression.compressors` without `zlib`, e.g., `snappy,zstd` or `disabled`.

The vulnerability has been fixed in the following versions:

* 8.2.3

* 8.0.17

* 7.0.28

* 6.0.27

* 5.0.32

* 4.4.30

### Impact on {{ yandex-cloud }} services {#impact-on-yandex-cloud-services}
