CVSS rating: [3.3 LOW](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2022-24736&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L&version=3.1&source=GitHub,%20Inc.).

### Impact

#### General impact

All Redis databases prior to version 7.0.0 and 6.2.7 are affected.

#### Impact on {{ yandex-cloud }} services

The {{ mrd-short-name }} service uses the following Redis versions: 5.0, 6.0, 6.2.

The following measures are being taken to mitigate the vulnerability in {{ yandex-cloud }} services:

* All instances of version 6.2 will be upgraded to the updated version 6.2.7. The upgrade will occur following the standard cluster settings.
* For versions 6.0 or 5.0, the vendor has not released updates. Users need to upgrade to version 6.2 themselves in order to get the standard update to version 6.2.7.

### Compensatory measures

If you are using Redis version 6.0 or 5.0 as part of {{ mrd-short-name }}, upgrade to version 6.2 as soon as possible.

If you are using your own Redis installation, upgrade to version 6.2.7 or 7.0.0. If an upgrade isn't currently possible, the vendor has released a [workaround](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-3qpw-7686-5984).
