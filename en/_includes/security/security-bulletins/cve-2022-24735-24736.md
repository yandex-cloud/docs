### Impact

#### General impact

All Redis databases prior to version 7.0.0 and 6.2.7 are affected.

#### Impact on {{ yandex-cloud }} services

The {{ mrd-short-name }} service uses the following Redis versions: 5.0, 6.0, 6.2.

* All instances of version 6.2 will be upgraded to version 6.2.7 according to cluster settings.
* For versions 6.0 or 5.0, the vendor has not released updates, users need to upgrade to version 6.2 themselves.

### Compensatory measures

If you are using Redis version 6.0 or 5.0 as part of {{ mrd-short-name }}, upgrade to version 6.2 as soon as possible.

If you are using your own Redis installation, upgrade to version 6.2.7 or 7.0.0. In case it is not possible to upgrade, the vendor has released a [workaround](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-3qpw-7686-5984).
