### Summary {#brief-description}

In {{ k8s }}, a user monitoring responses to `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` or `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` requests is able to redirect `kube-apiserver` requests to private networks hosting an API server. If the logging level is `10`, logs will capture responses from such private networks.

### Technologies affected {#technologies-affected}

### Safe version of vulnerable product or patch {#safe-version}

No patches or safe versions.

### Compensatory measures for {{ yandex-cloud }} users {#compensatory-measures}

<https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/RV2IhwcrQsY>

Block `kube-apiserver` access to resources with sensitive information.

You can also set a value below `10` for the` -v` flag or `false` for the `--profiling` flag (default is `true`). Webhook requests will be redirected to private networks but logs will not capture the body of the requests at a logging level below `10`. Users will not be able to modify the `kube-apiserver` logging level.

### Impact on {{ yandex-cloud }} services {#impact-on-yandex-cloud-services}

No impact. The API serer in {{ managed-k8s-full-name }} is isolated from the service interface. The server runs under an individual user account that is isolated by a local firewall.
