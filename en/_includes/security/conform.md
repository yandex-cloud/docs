## ISO certification {#iso}


The {{ yandex-cloud }} Information Security Management System (ISMS) satisfies the requirements of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This is evidenced by certificates of compliance for ISO 27001, ISO 27017, and ISO 27018.

ISO 27001 defines the requirements for information security (IS) management systems, including their implementation, operation, maintenance, and regular improvement. The ISO 27001 guidelines help organizations guarantee a high level of security for their core information assets.

ISO 27017 includes a set of practical information security recommendations for cloud providers. These recommendations supplement the ISMS implementation requirements set out in ISO 27001 and are intended for cloud service providers.

ISO 27018 addresses the requirements for the security of personal data processed by cloud service providers. The standard sets out information security guidelines for protecting the personal information of clients. They supplement the requirements of the basic standard, ISO 27001.
