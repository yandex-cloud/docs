# Compliance


## Federal Law No. 152-FZ of the Russian Federation on Personal Data {#law}

In {{ yandex-cloud }}, measures were implemented to protect personal data pursuant to Resolution No. 1119 and FSTEC Order No. 21 regarding requirements for 1st-level protection (UZ-1).

When a client, acting as an operator, stores personal data on {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, the client authorizes Yandex to process such data. {{ yandex-cloud }} is committed to respecting the privacy of personal data, ensuring its security while processing, and meeting all legal requirements pertaining to the protection of personal data being processed.

## GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) {#gdpr}

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs the collection and processing of personal data of individuals located in the European Economic Area. It was designed to strengthen data privacy protection and ensure the transparency of data collection, storage, and processing on the internet.

{{ yandex-cloud }} regards the GDPR as the global standard for privacy and data protection. If our customer is subject to the GDPR, we implement the measures necessary for them to remain compliant when using Yandex Cloud. We value privacy and have procedures in place to inform customers about any possible incidents.

## ISO/IEC certification {#iso}

The {{ yandex-cloud }} Information Security Management System (ISMS) meets the requirements of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This is evidenced by ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27017, and ISO/IEC 27018 certification.

ISO/IEC 27001 defines the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving ISMS's. The ISO/IEC 27001 guidelines help organizations guarantee a high level of security for their core information assets.

ISO/IEC 27017 includes a code of practice for information security control for cloud providers. These guidelines supplement the ISMS implementation requirements set out in ISO/IEC 27001 and are intended for cloud service providers.

ISO/IEC 27018 sets the requirements for the protection of personal data processed by cloud service providers. The standard sets out information security guidelines for protecting the personal information of clients. They supplement the requirements of the basic standard, ISO/IEC 27001.

## PCI DSS {#pci-dss}

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) contains requirements for cardholder data protection. These are mandatory and apply to all companies processing data from payment systems like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, MIR, etc.

By ensuring that our cloud infrastructure meets PCI DSS requirements, we enable {{ yandex-cloud }} clients to use cloud services to process payment card data with verified high levels of security.

{{ yandex-cloud }} has a certificate of compliance with PCI DSS v3.2.1. Compliance with the standard is checked by a QSA auditor on an annual basis.

## PCI 3-D Secure (PCI 3DS) {#pci-3d-secure}

The PCI 3-D Secure (PCI 3DS) standard defines the requirements for infrastructure used to receive payments through the 3-D Secure protocol. The protocol implements an additional request to authenticate a card transaction. Such protocol components as the Access Control Server (3DS Server or Directory Server) are normally deployed on the card issuing bank's side.

{{ yandex-cloud }} customers are able to deploy components implementing the 3-D Secure protocol in the cloud infrastructure.

## GOST R 57580.1-2017 {#gost}

GOST R 57580.1-2017 is the Russian national security standard for banking and financial operations. The standard was approved January 1, 2018, and offers a comprehensive approach to developing an information protection process in financial organizations. It also contains requirements for information protection at all lifecycle stages of automated systems and applications used by companies and banks. The standard sets the obligation to apply information protection measures for credit and non-credit financial organizations.

The cloud platform's services are made to comply with this standard to help the organizations whose systems and applications are deployed in the cloud to meet the requirements of the Central Bank (as set forth in Regulations 683-P and 684-P of the Bank of Russia) and ensure compliance with the standard on their cloud systems' side.

The {{ yandex-cloud }} platform is certified as [compliant](https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/yc-compliance/certificates/YC_GOST_conformance_ru_finance_2023.pdf) with the information security requirements set by the Bank of Russia. The statement certifies that the information security management and control system of Yandex.Cloud LLC was evaluated for compliance with the requirements of GOST R 57580.1-2017 for extended information security. As of the audit completion date, the overall score was R=0.92 (level 5 compliance). According to GOST R 57580.2-2018, this means that the organizational and technical measures forming part of the information protection system process are implemented fully and consistently in accordance with the organization's general approaches (methods).

{{ yandex-cloud }} services can be used by systemically important financial institutions, financial institutions that provide payment infrastructure services for systemically important payment systems, and systemically important financial market utilities.
