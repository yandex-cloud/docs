# 4. Data encryption and key management

### Introduction {#intro}

{{ yandex-cloud }} provides built-in encryption features for a number of services. It's the customer's responsibility to enable encryption in these services and implement encryption in other components for processing critical data. Data encryption and encryption key management is done by [{{ kms-name }}](../../../kms/) ({{ kms-short-name }}).

{{ yandex-cloud }} APIs support cipher suites in specific TLS versions that are compliant with PCI DSS and other standards.

### Encryption at rest {#at-rest}

By default, all user data at rest is encrypted at the {{ yandex-cloud }} level. Encryption at the {{ yandex-cloud }} level implements one of the best practices for protecting user data and is performed using {{ yandex-cloud }} keys.

If your corporate information security policy sets specific key size and rotation frequency requirements, you can encrypt data with your own keys. To do this, you can use the {{ kms-short-name }} service and its integration with other {{ yandex-cloud }} services or implement data plane encryption completely on your own.

{{ yandex-cloud }} provides data-at-rest encryption for the following services:
* {{ objstorage-name }}.
* {{ managed-k8s-name }}.

#### 4.1 In {{ objstorage-full-name }}, encryption of data at rest using {{ kms-short-name }} keys is enabled {#storage-kms}

To protect critical data in {{ objstorage-full-name }}, we recommend using bucket server-side encryption with {{ kms-full-name }} keys. This encryption method protects against the accidental or intentional publication of bucket contents on the internet. For more information, see  [Encryption](../../../storage/concepts/encryption.md) in the {{ objstorage-name }} documentation.

- Performing a check in the management console

   1. In the management console, select the cloud or folder to check the buckets in.
   1. In the list of services, select **{{ objstorage-name }}**.
   1. Go to the bucket settings.
   1. Go to the **Encryption** tab.
   1. Make sure that encryption is enabled and the {{ kms-short-name }} encryption key is specified.
   1. If encryption is enabled, the recommendation is fulfilled. Otherwise, proceed to the "Instructions and solutions to use".

- Performing a check via the CLI

   1. [Configure](../../../storage/tools/aws-cli.md) the AWS CLI to work with a cloud.
   1. Run the command below to check if encryption is enabled:

      ```bash
      aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/ \
      s3api get-bucket-encryption \
      --bucket <bucket name>
      ```

   1. If encryption is enabled, the recommendation is fulfilled. Otherwise, proceed to the "Instructions and solutions to use".

{% endlist %}

**Instructions and solutions to use:**

Configure bucket encryption using the [instructions](../../../storage/operations/buckets/encrypt.md).

### Encryption in transit {#in-transit}

In most cases, you can only connect to {{ yandex-cloud }} services over HTTPS. However, some scenarios allow data plane access to services over HTTP, without connection encryption at the application level. In all these scenarios, the user can choose the protocol to be used for data plane operations (HTTP or HTTPS) in the service settings, and specify their own TLS certificate if HTTPS is selected.

{% note info %}

When working with (or connecting to) {{ yandex-cloud }} APIs, make sure to use TLS 1.2 or higher, since its prior versions are vulnerable.

For example, by using the gRPC interfaces of {{ yandex-cloud }}, you can enforce TLS 1.2 or higher. That's because gRPC is based on HTTP/2 where TLS 1.2 is the minimum supported TLS version.

Support for legacy TLS protocols in {{ yandex-cloud }} services will [gradually be discontinued](../../../security/security-bulletins/index.md).

{% endnote %}

{{ yandex-cloud }} lets you use your own TLS certificates for the following services:
* {{ objstorage-name }}.
* {{ alb-name }}.
* {{ api-gw-name }}.
* {{ cdn-name }}.

#### 4.2 HTTPS is enabled for hosting static websites in {{ objstorage-full-name }} {#storage-https}

[{{ objstorage-name }}](../../../storage/) supports secure connections over HTTPS. You can upload your own security certificate if a connection to your {{ objstorage-name }} website requires HTTPS access. Integration with [{{ certificate-manager-name }}](../../../certificate-manager/) is also supported. See instructions in the {{ objstorage-name }} documentation:
* [Configuring HTTPS](../../../storage/operations/hosting/certificate.md)
* [Bucket](../../../storage/concepts/bucket.md)

When using [{{ objstorage-name }}](../../../storage/), be sure that support for TLS protocols below version 1.2 is disabled at the client level. Use the bucket policy [`aws:securetransport`](../../../storage/s3/api-ref/policy/conditions.md) to ensure that running without TLS is disabled for the bucket.

### Providing encryption on your own {#self-encryption}

**When using services with no built-in encryption, it's the customer's responsibility to ensure that critical data is encrypted.**

#### 4.6 For critical VMs, disk encryption using {{ kms-short-name }} is set up {#self-vm-kms}

If disk encryption is required, place your application files on a VM's secondary disk (not the boot disk) and configure full disk encryption for it.

**Instructions and solutions to use:**

[VM disk encryption using {{ kms-short-name }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/encrypt_and_keys/encrypt_disk_VM).

{% list tabs %}

- Manual check

   Manually check whether this solution is used for critical VMs.

{% endlist %}

#### 4.7 For critical data, encryption with {{ kms-short-name }} is used {#self-data-kms}

If data encryption is required, make sure to encrypt data at the application level prior to writing it to a database, for example, using [{{ kms-short-name }}](../../../kms/operations/encryption.md).

{% list tabs %}

- Manual check

   Make sure that data is stored in an encrypted form.

{% endlist %}

#### 4.8 Data encryption at the application level is used {#self-data-app}

For client-side encryption before uploading data to a {{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket, you can use the following approaches:
* Integrating {{ objstorage-name }} with the {{ kms-name }} service for client-side encryption. For more information, see "Recommended cryptographic libraries".
* Using third-party client-side encryption libraries prior to sending data to {{ objstorage-name }}. If you use third-party data encryption libraries and your own key management methods, be sure that your operation model, algorithms, and key sizes comply with regulatory requirements.

For client-side encryption, we recommend that you use the following libraries:
* AWS Encryption SDK and its [{{ kms-short-name }} integration](../../../kms/tutorials/encrypt/aws-encryption-sdk.md).
* Google Tink and its [{{ kms-short-name }} integration](../../../kms/tutorials/encrypt/google-tink.md).
* [{{ yandex-cloud }} SDK](../../../kms/tutorials/encrypt/sdk.md) with any other cryptographic library compatible with PCI DSS or any standards used in your company.

For a comparison of libraries, see the {{ kms-short-name }} documentation,  [Which encryption method should I choose?](../../../kms/tutorials/encrypt/).

{% list tabs %}

- Manual check

   Make sure that data is stored in an encrypted form.

{% endlist %}

### Managing keys {#keys}

We recommend that you use [{{ kms-name }}](../../../kms/tutorials/encrypt/sdk.md) for encrypting data and managing keys. {{ kms-short-name }} helps you protect data in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. You can also use it to encrypt or decrypt any of your data.

{{ kms-short-name }} uses AES-GCM encryption mode. You can select the key length (128, 192, or 256 bits) and set up the preferred key rotation period.

#### 4.9 KMS uses a Hardware Security Module (HSM) {#keys-hsm}

You can also create a key whose every cryptographic operation will only be handled inside a hardware security module (HSM). For more information, see [Hardware Security Module (HSM)](../../../kms/concepts/hsm.md).

To use the HSM, when creating a key, select AES-256 HSM as the algorithm type. The HSM will handle all operations with this key internally, and no additional actions are required.

We recommend using HSMs for {{ kms-short-name }} keys to enhance the security level.

      done;
      done
      ```

   1. If the encryption algorithm contains AES-256 HSM, the recommendation is fulfilled. Otherwise, proceed to the "Instructions and solutions to use".

{% endlist %}

**Instructions and solutions to use:**

[Set](../../../kms/operations/encryption.md) the encryption algorithm for {{ kms-short-name }} keys to AES-256 HSM.

#### 4.10 Permissions to manage keys in {{ kms-short-name }} are granted to users under control {#keys-controlled-users}

To access the {{ kms-short-name }} service, you need an [IAM token](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md).

To automate operations with {{ kms-short-name }}, we recommend that you create a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) and run commands and scripts under it. If you use VMs, get an IAM token for your service account using the mechanism of [assigning a service account](../../../compute/operations/vm-connect/auth-inside-vm.md) to your VM. For other ways to get an IAM token for your service account, see the {{ iam-short-name }} documentation,  [Getting an IAM token for a service account](../../../iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-sa.md).

We recommend that you grant granular permissions for specific keys in the {{ kms-short-name }} service to your users and service accounts. For more information, see the {{ kms-short-name }} documentation, [Access management in {{ kms-name }}](../../../kms/security/).

For more information about security measures for access control, see [Authentication and access control](../../../security/domains/access.md).

To verify the {{ kms-short-name }} key access rights, check out who is granted access rights to:
* An organization, cloud, and folders with permissions such as: `admin`, `editor`, `kms.admin`, `kms.editor`, and `kms.keys.encrypterDecrypter`.
* Keys such as: `kms.keys.encrypterDecrypter` and `kms.editor`.

      done
      ```

{% endlist %}

**Instructions and solutions to use:**

Check out who is granted access to {{ kms-short-name }} keys.

#### 4.11 For {{ kms-short-name }} keys, rotation is enabled {#keys-rotation}

To improve the security of your infrastructure, we recommend that you categorize your encryption keys into two groups:
* Keys for services that process critical data, but don't store it. For example, {{ message-queue-name }} and {{ sf-name }}.
* Keys for services that store critical data. For example, Managed Services for Databases.

For the first group, we recommend that you set up automatic key rotation with a rotation period longer than the data processing period in these services. When the rotation period expires, the old key versions must be deleted. In the case of automatic rotation and the deletion of old key versions, previously processed data can't be restored and decrypted.

For data storage services, we recommend that you either manually rotate keys or use automatic key rotation, depending on your internal procedures for processing critical data.

A secure value for AES-GCM mode is encryption using 4294967296 (= 2<sup>32</sup>) blocks. Having reached this number of encrypted blocks, you need to create a new DEK version. For more information about the AES-GCM operating mode, see the [NIST materials](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf).

{% note info %}

Destroying any version of a key means destroying all data encrypted with it. You can protect a key against deletion by setting the deletionProtection parameter. However, it doesn't protect against deleting individual versions.

{% endnote %}

For more information about key rotation, see the {{ kms-short-name }} documentation, [Key version](../../../kms/concepts/version.md).

### Managing secrets {#secrets}

Don't use critical data and access secrets (such as authentication tokens, API keys, and encryption keys) explicitly in the code, cloud object names and descriptions, VM metadata, and so on. Instead, use secret storage services like {{ lockbox-short-name }} or HashiCorp Vault.

#### 4.13 The organization uses {{ lockbox-full-name }} as a secret management service {#secrets-lockbox}

Don't use critical data and access secrets (such as authentication tokens, API keys, and encryption keys) explicitly in the code, cloud object names and descriptions, VM metadata, and so on. Instead, use secret storage services like {{ lockbox-short-name }} or HashiCorp Vault (from {{ marketplace-name }}).

{{ lockbox-short-name }} securely stores secrets in an encrypted form only. Encryption is performed using {{ kms-short-name }}. For secret access control, use service roles.

For instructions on how to use the service, see the [{{ lockbox-short-name }} documentation](../../../lockbox/).

[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) lets you use {{ kms-short-name }} as a trusted service for encrypting secrets. This is implemented through the [Auto Unseal](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/seal) mechanism.

To store secrets with Vault, you can use a VM based on an [image](/marketplace/products/yc/vault-yckms) from {{ marketplace-name }} with a pre-installed HashiCorp Vault build and Auto Unseal support. Instructions for setting up Auto Unseal are provided in the {{ kms-short-name }} documentation, [Auto Unseal in Hashicorp Vault](../../../kms/tutorials/vault-secret.md).

   1. Run the command below to search for at least one {{ lockbox-short-name }} secret:

      ```bash
      export ORG_ID=<organization ID>
      for CLOUD_ID in $(yc resource-manager cloud list --organization-id=${ORG_ID} --format=json | jq -r '.[].id');
      do for FOLDER_ID in $(yc resource-manager folder list --cloud-id=$CLOUD_ID --format=json | jq -r '.[].id');
      do yc lockbox secret list --folder-id=$FOLDER_ID --format=json
      done;
      done
      ```

   1. If an empty list is output, the recommendation is fulfilled. If not, proceed to the "Instructions and solutions to use".

{% endlist %}

**Instructions and solutions to use:**

Store secrets in {{ lockbox-short-name }} or Hashicorp Vault from {{ marketplace-short-name }}.

#### 4.14 For {{ serverless-containers-name }} and {{ sf-name }}, {{ lockbox-short-name }} secrets are used {#secrets-serverless-functions}

When working with {{ serverless-containers-name }} or {{ sf-name }}, it is often necessary to use a secret (such as a token or password).

If you specify secret information in environment variables, it can be viewed by any cloud user with permissions to view and use a function, which causes information security risks.

We recommend using Serverless integration with {{ lockbox-short-name }} for that. You can use a specific secret from {{ lockbox-full-name }} and a service account with access rights to this secret to use it in a function or container.

Make sure that the secrets are used as described above.

{% list tabs %}

- Performing a check in the management console

   1. In the management console, select the cloud or folder to check the functions in.
   1. In the list of services, select **{{ sf-name }}**.
   1. Go to the function settings, the **Editor** tab.
   1. Find the **{{ lockbox-short-name }} secrets** parameter.
   1. If the parameters of each object specify **{{ lockbox-short-name }} secrets** or there are no environment variables with secret data, the recommendation is fulfilled. Otherwise, proceed to the "Instructions and solutions to use".

- Performing a check via the CLI

   1. Run the command below to search for all the cloud functions that use no {{ lockbox-short-name }} secrets and make sure that these functions use no secret data in environment variables:

      ```bash
      export ORG_ID=<organization ID>
      for CLOUD_ID in $(yc resource-manager cloud list --organization-id=${ORG_ID} --format=json | jq -r '.[].id');
      do for FOLDER_ID in $(yc resource-manager folder list --cloud-id=$CLOUD_ID --format=json | jq -r '.[].id');
      do for VER in $(yc serverless function version list --folder-id=$FOLDER_ID --format=json | jq -r '.[].id'); \
      do yc serverless function version get $VER --format=json | jq -r '. | select(.secrets | not)' | jq -r '.id'
      done;
      done;
      done
      ```

   1. If an empty list is output, the recommendation is fulfilled. Otherwise, proceed to the "Instructions and solutions to use".

{% endlist %}

**Instructions and solutions to use:**

Delete the secret data from env and [use](../../../functions/operations/function/version-manage.md) the {{ lockbox-short-name }} integration functionality.

#### 4.15 When working with {{ coi }}, secret encryption is used {#secrets-coi}

{{ kms-short-name }} supports the encryption of secrets used in a {{ TF }} configuration, such as to transfer secrets to a VM in encrypted form. See the instructions in the {{ kms-short-name }} documentation, [Encrypting secrets in  {{ TF-full }}](../../../kms/tutorials/terraform-secret.md)  It's not safe to explicitly pass secrets through environment variables, because they are displayed in the VM properties.

**Instructions and solutions to use:**

[Encrypting secrets in {{ TF }} to transfer them to a VM from a {{ coi }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/encrypt_and_keys/terraform%2BKMS%2BCOI).
