* Optionally, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.policy-form.field_run-later }}** to run all skipped backup jobs after the VM starts if the VM was `Stopped` during the scheduled backup. This is only supported for incremental backups.
* Optionally, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.policy-overview.field_fast-copy }}** to speed up incremental backups. Changes in the file will be determined by size, date, and last update time. If the option is disabled, {{ backup-name }} will compare the contents of all files with the backup contents. This option does not work for volumes with JFS, ReiserFS3, ReiserFS4, ReFS, or XFS file systems.
* Optionally, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.policy-form.field_sector-by-sector }}** to create an exact disk or volume backup at the physical level. Backs up all disk or volume sectors, including empty areas and unallocated space. If no compression level is selected, the backup size will be equal to the disk size. This mode is used automatically for disks with unsupported file systems. You cannot recover app data from a backup like that.
* Optionally, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.policy-form.field_validation-enabled }}** to make sure you will be able to restore data from the backup. During the check, a checksum is calculated for each section available for recovery. The check may take a long time because it scans all recoverable data.
