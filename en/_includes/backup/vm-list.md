Once you install the {{ backup-name }} agent, the VM will be added to **{{ backup-name }}** in the ![machines](../../_assets/console-icons/server.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.label_instances }}** tab and you will be able to link it to a [backup policy](../../backup/concepts/policy.md). If you selected a backup policy when creating the VM, then the VM is already linked to the policy and no further action is required.
