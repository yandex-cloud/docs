### storage.editor {#storage-editor}

Users with the `storage.editor` role can perform any operation with [buckets](../storage/concepts/bucket.md) and [objects](../storage/concepts/object.md) in the folder: create (including a publicly accessible bucket), delete, and edit them.

This role doesn't let you manage access control list ([ACL](../storage/concepts/acl.md)) settings.
