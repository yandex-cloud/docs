# Authentication in the API


To perform operations via the API, you need to get an [IAM token](../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md):

* [Instructions](../iam/operations/iam-token/create.md) for a Yandex account.
* [Instructions](../iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-federation.md) for a federated account.

{% note info %}

You cannot use a [service account](../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) to access the Billing API.

{% endnote %}

{% include [iam-token-usage](iam-token-usage.md) %}
