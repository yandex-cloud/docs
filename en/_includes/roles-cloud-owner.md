The `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}` role is assigned for a cloud and makes the user a cloud owner. The owner can perform any operation with the cloud and its resources.

Only a cloud owner can assign and revoke a user's `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}` role.

A cloud must have at least one owner. A user that created a cloud automatically becomes its owner. The sole owner of a cloud may not give up this role.
