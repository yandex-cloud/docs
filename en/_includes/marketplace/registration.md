Open the [Marketplace](/marketplace) page and fill out a request to add your product to the Marketplace. In the request, specify the [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) of the business that will publish the product. By submitting the request, you accept the [Offer]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://yandex.ru/legal/marketplace_offer/?lang=ru){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://yandex.ru/legal/marketplace_offer/?lang=en){% endif %} for Software Product Access on the Marketplace.

Once {{ yandex-cloud }} verifies your request, the specified billing account gets Yandex Cloud Marketplace partner status and access to the [partner interface](https://partners.cloud.yandex.ru/). You'll receive an email notification when that happens.
