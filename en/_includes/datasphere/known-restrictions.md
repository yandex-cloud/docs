## Current limitations of the service {#known-restrictions}

* One project, one notebook. You can't make many tabs with notebooks.
* You don't have access to `.ipynb` files. You can't export a notebook in this format or publish it on github.
* You can't restart kernels in a notebook. A kernel restart is often used to clear variables, but in the {{ ml-platform-name }}, you can [clear variables](../../datasphere/operations/projects/clear-kernel-state.md) without restarting the kernel.
