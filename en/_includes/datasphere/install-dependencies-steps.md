To install a package:

1. Write the following command in the notebook cell:

   ```
   %pip install <Package_name>
   ```

   For example, install the [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) package to visualize statistics:

   ```
   %pip install seaborn
   ```

   You can use various options that the [pip install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/) command supports. For details, see [usage examples](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#pip-install-examples) for this command.
1. Run the cell. To do this, click ![Run](../../_assets/datasphere/jupyterlab/run.svg).

   The package installation result is displayed under the cell.
