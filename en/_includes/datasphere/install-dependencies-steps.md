1. Write the following command in the notebook cell:

    ```
    %pip install <Package name>

    ```
    %pip install seaborn
    ```

    You can use various options that the [pip install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/) command supports. See a [usage examples](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#pip-install-examples) of the command.

1. Run the cell. To do this, click ![Run](../../_assets/datasphere/jupyterlab/run.svg).

    The package installation result is displayed under the cell.
