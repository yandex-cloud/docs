By default, a project runs on a VM with the minimal <q>S</q> configuration (32 GB RAM and 2 vCPUs). You can migrate to a VM with [another configuration](../../datasphere/concepts/vm-configurations.md) any time when using the service. This saves the state of the interpreter, meaning that no variables or calculation results are lost.
