For example, Julia works with multiple teams and belongs to their communities with different access rights:
* In the <q>Cat lovers</q> community: `Admin` (the `{{ roles-datasphere-communities-admin }}` role).
* In the <q>Counting fences</q> community: `Admin` (the `{{ roles-datasphere-communities-admin }}` role).
* In the <q>Top secret</q> community: `Developer` (the `{{ roles-datasphere-communities-developer }}` role), but no `Admin` privilege in the <q>Project_111</q> project of this community (the `{{ roles-datasphere-project-admin }}` role).

Julia can share the resources of any <q>Cat lovers</q> or <q>Counting fences</q> projects in any of these communities. She can also publish <q>Project_111</q> resources in these communities, but can't share them in the <q>Top secret</q> community.
