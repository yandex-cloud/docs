You can upload small amounts of data (up to 100 MB) to your {{ ml-platform-name }} project over the JupyterLab interface. If you want to upload larger amounts of data, use your network storages or databases. For larger data volumes, it's also convenient to use [datasets](../../datasphere-ui-preview/concepts/dataset.md).

To upload data to your project over the JupyterLab interface:

1. Under the ![folder](../../_assets/datasphere/jupyterlab/folder.svg) **File Browser** section, select the directory to upload a data to.
1. Click ![upload](../../_assets/datasphere/jupyterlab/upload.svg) at the top left.
1. Select the files to upload.
