## Sharing {{ ml-platform-name }} resources {#share}

{{ ml-platform-name }} resources are assigned to the [project](../../datasphere/concepts/project.md) in which they were created. However, communities enable you to use resources from a project in other projects. This helps you save your time and money on new resource creation.

A project editor can use the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.access }}** tab on the resource page to share a project resource in a community where they are a developer. The resource will then appear among the community resources and all community members will be able to use it in their projects.
