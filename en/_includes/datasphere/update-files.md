If you change the contents of a file in one project, the modified file version becomes available in other projects. If you create a file in a project, it appears in the list of resources and also becomes available in other projects.

You can [download a file](../../datasphere/operations/resources/download.md) from the list of resources at any time or share it by [getting a public link](../../datasphere/operations/resources/get-link.md).
