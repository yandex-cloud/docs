## Federated users {#user-sso}

If you did not enable the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.entity.federation.field.autocreateUsers }}** option when [setting up the federation](../../organization/concepts/add-federation.md#federation-usage), you will have to add federated users to your organization manually.

To do this, you need to know the usersâ€™ name IDs returned by the identity provider (IdP) server together with the successful authentication response. This will usually be the user's email address. To find out what the server returns as the name ID, contact the administrator who configured authentication for your federation.

{% include [auto-create-users](../../_includes/organization/auto-create-users.md) %}

You do not need to invite federated users to the organization; they are added automatically on their first login.

Users with any of the following [roles](../../organization/security/index.md) can add or remove federated users from the organization: `organization-manager.federations.userAdmin`, `organization-manager.federations.admin`, `organization-manager.admin`, or `organization-manager.organizations.owner`.
