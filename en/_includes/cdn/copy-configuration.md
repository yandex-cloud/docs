You can use CDN resource settings from a configuration of another CDN resource. To do this, in the **Copy a configuration** field, select an existing CDN resource. Keep in mind the following:
* A domain name is unique within a single resource, i.e., you cannot create another resource with the same domain name. A configuration copy does not inherit the domain name.
* Copying settings between resources of different providers creates a copy of the [origin group](../../cdn/concepts/origins.md) in the provider of the new resource.
* If you uploaded a TLS certificate for the original resource, the system will re-use it in the new resource. You do not need to upload it again.
