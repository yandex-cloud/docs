## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

To create a trigger, you need:

1. Service account with rights for function call. If you don't have a service account, [create one](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md).
1. [Functions](../../functions/concepts/function.md) that the trigger will call. If you don't have a function:
    - [Create a function](../../functions/operations/function/function-create.md).
    - [Create a version of the function and upload the function code to it](../../functions/operations/function/version-manage.md#func-version-create).
