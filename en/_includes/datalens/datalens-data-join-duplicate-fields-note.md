{% note info %}

When you merge data from multiple tables, a dataset will get duplicates of the fields used to create links. You can remove them manually from the list of dataset fields. You can also [describe the dataset using an SQL query](../../datalens/operations/dataset/add-data.md) and exclude duplicate fields from the final set.
