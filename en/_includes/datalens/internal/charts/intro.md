[**Yandex Charts**](https://charts.yandex-team.ru) is a universal service for creating charts
 on top of data from dozens of sources and embedding these charts in interfaces of other services.

Use the **Charts API** to create and update charts. With it, you can generate any number of charts using a script and then place them on dashboards, take a screenshot, export data, and more. As an output, you'll have a regular config that can be edited in the [Editor](https://charts.yandex-team.ru/editor) or [Wizard](https://charts.yandex-team.ru/wizard). When generating a chart via the API, remember that it's often easier to use [parameterization](../../../../datalens/editor/params.md) instead of creating N charts.
