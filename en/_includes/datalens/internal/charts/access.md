### Interaction with Yandex Vault

You can't add a secret from [Yandex Vault](../../../../datalens/editor/yav.md) to a chart created using the Charts API. You can create a connection in {{ datalens-name }}, set a specific user and password in it, and use this connection to access ChartEditor (see an [example in Atushka.](https://clubs.at.yandex-team.ru/statistics/2364)).
