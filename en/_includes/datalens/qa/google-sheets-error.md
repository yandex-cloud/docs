If there are empty cells in the Google Sheets document, {{ datalens-short-name }} may incorrectly display column headers and lose the first several rows.

To correct the situation, enter any appropriate values in the Google Sheets spreadsheet's empty cells, such as `none`, `no`, `unknown`.

To fill in empty cells in a Google Sheets spreadsheet quickly:

1\. Highlight the entire Google Sheets spreadsheet.
2\. In the spreadsheet menu, select **Data** â†’ **Create a filter**.
3\. In the first column, click the filter icon in the right-hand corner of the top cell.
4\. Click **Clear** and select **(Blanks)** as your value.
5\. In the column's top cell, enter the desired value, such as: `0`, `none`, `no`, or any other.
6\. Drag the cell down to propagate the value entered to all the empty cells in the column.
7\. Click the filter icon again and click **Select all**.
8\. Apply all these steps starting with Step 3 to the spreadsheet's remaining columns.
