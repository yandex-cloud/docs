{% note warning %}

Rights management for QL charts according to {{ monitoring-short-name }} and {{ prometheus-name }} data is performed not only on the DataLens side, but also in the {{ monitoring-short-name }} and {{ prometheus-name }} services themselves.

To view a chart in {{ datalens-short-name }}, a user needs rights to chart and connect, as well as to read data from a specific {{ prometheus-name }} API or project in {{ monitoring-short-name }}.
