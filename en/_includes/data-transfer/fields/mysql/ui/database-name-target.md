**Database name**: Specify the name of the database in the selected cluster. Leave the field empty if you want to create tables in databases with the same names as on the source. In this case, explicitly specify a DB schema for service tables under [additional settings](../../../../../data-transfer/operations/endpoint/target/mysql.md#additional-settings).
