When you add new collections while editing an endpoint used in {{ dt-type-copy-repl }} or {{ dt-type-repl }} transfers with the {{ dt-status-repl }} status, the data history for these collections will not get uploaded. To add a collection with its historical data, use the **List of objects to be transferred** field in the [transfer settings](../../../../data-transfer/operations/transfer.md#update).
