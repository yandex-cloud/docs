Shard settings:

* `connection.connection_options.on_premise.shards.name`: Shard name that the service will use to distinguish shards from each other. If sharding is disabled in your custom installation, specify any name.
* `connection.connection_options.on_premise.shards.hosts`: specify the FQDNs or IP addresses of the hosts in the shard.
