If in your transfers from {{ PG }} you specify, in the **Cursor column** setting, the `SERIAL` field or the field generated with `SEQUENCE` and enable sharded copying, then the columns that were created in parallel threads might fail to be added to the next snapshot of the source and won't transfer to the target. This is because `SEQUENCE` in {{ PG }} [is agnostic of transaction sequence](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-sequence.html): for the transaction that was completed earlier, the value in the cursor column might be higher than for the transaction completed later.
