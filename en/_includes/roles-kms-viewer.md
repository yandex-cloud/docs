### kms.viewer {#kms-viewer}

The `kms.viewer` role grants permission to view a list of keys and information about them.

You can now assign this role to an [organization](../organization/index.yaml), [cloud](../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), [folder](../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder), or [key](../kms/concepts/key).

A {{ kms-short-name }} administrator can grant a role (the `kms.admin` role).

For more information on using roles in {{ kms-name }}, read [{#T}](../kms/security/index.md).
