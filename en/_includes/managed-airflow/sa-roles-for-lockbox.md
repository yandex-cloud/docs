To extract the required information from the secret, the cluster service account must have the `lockbox.payloadViewer` [role](../../lockbox/security/index.md#lockbox-payloadViewer).

You can assign this role either at the [folder level](../../iam/operations/roles/grant.md#cloud-or-folder) or [individual secret level](../../lockbox/operations/secret-access.md).
