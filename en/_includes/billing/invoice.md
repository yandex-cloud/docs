Advance invoices are issued towards the middle of the month following the reporting period. The advance invoice amount is formed as the total money paid during the reporting period, less the amount confirmed by the work (service) completion report. Invoices are delivered to the customer via the Electronic Document Management (EDM) system, plus as original copies: via Russian Post and to the email address specified in the agreement.
