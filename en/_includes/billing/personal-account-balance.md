You can monitor the balance in the management console:
- The balance is reduced automatically as you consume resources. You can view your resource consumption history on the [Usage details](../operations/check-charges.md) page.
- The balance increases when you credit funds to it. The top-up record is logged to the [payment history](../operations/check-bill-history.md).
