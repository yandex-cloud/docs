1. In the management console, go to [Billing]({{ link-console-billing }}).

1. On the **List of accounts** page, click **Create account**. Fill in your information:
   * Select the payer's country.
   * Specify the name of the billing account that will be displayed in the list of billing accounts.

1. If in the **Payers** section you see a list of available payers, you can select one of them or add a new one.
