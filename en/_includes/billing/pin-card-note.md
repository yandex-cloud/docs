{% note info %}

Linking a bank card is only necessary for creating a billing account. Funds from the linked card can only be debited after you [activate the paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md) and start using the {{ yandex-cloud }} services. You can [change your payment method](../operations/change-payment-method.md) any time after creating a billing account.
