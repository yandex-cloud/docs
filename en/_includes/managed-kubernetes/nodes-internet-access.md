To connect to external resources, e.g., Docker image registries such as [{{ container-registry-name }}](../../container-registry/concepts/index.md), [{{ cloud-registry-name }}](../../cloud-registry/concepts/index.md), or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) as well as [{{ objstorage-name }} buckets](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md), the group nodes must have internet access.

To enable internet access, [assign](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/node-group/node-group-update.md#node-internet-access) a public IP address to the nodes and [configure](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/connect/security-groups.md#rules-internal-nodegroup) a security group. As an alternative to public IP addresses, you can also create and configure a [NAT gateway](../../vpc/operations/create-nat-gateway.md) or a [NAT instance](../../vpc/tutorials/nat-instance/index.md) in the subnet hosting the nodes.
