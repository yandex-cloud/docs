* `regex`: RE2 standard regular expression that, when matched, will modify the request path string. In this example, the regular expression describes a path that begins with the `/api/users/` prefix, followed by any number of any characters (or nothing). In this case, everything that follows the prefix is ​​saved in a group (pocket).
* `substitute`: String that will replace the path matching the regular expression specified in `regex`. In the example above, the path will be replaced with a string consisting of the `/api/v1/users/` prefix and the contents of the group (pocket) saved in the regular expression.
