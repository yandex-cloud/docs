If you don't spend the full amount of the [initial grant](../billing/concepts/bonus-account.md) or one of its [parts](../free-trial/concepts/usage-grant.md) before upgrading to the paid version, you can use the remaining amount depending on when the grant expires:

- The grant **expires before** you upgrade to the paid version.

  The remaining amount expires and you can't use it to pay for Yandex.Cloud services after upgrading to the paid version.

- The grant **expires after** you upgrade to the paid version.

  You can use the remaining amount to pay for services, but only until the grant expires: as soon as that happens, the remaining amount expires, too.
