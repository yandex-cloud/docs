[Security groups](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) are at the [Preview stage](../../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md). If they are not available on your [network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network), all incoming and outgoing traffic for the resources will be allowed. No additional setup is required.

To enable security groups, request access to this feature from the [support team]({{ link-console-support }}/create-ticket).
