Links between issues are shown as arrows from the dependent to the blocking issue, in case:

   1. The start date is specified for both issues.
   1. The deadline is set for both issues.
   1. The <q>Dependent issue – Blocking issue</q> link is set up.

* To add a <q>Dependent issue – Blocking issue</q> [link](../../tracker/user/links.md), hover over the blocking issue to see points on the right and left side of the bar.

   * To make the selected issue dependent, click the point on the left and drag it to the blocking issue.

   * To make the selected issue blocking, click the point on the right and drag it to the dependent issue.

   {% note info %}

   If the dependent issue deadline is earlier than that of the blocking issue, the arrow is red. You can enable [automatic update of start dates and deadlines](#timing) for dependent issues.

   {% endnote %}

* To delete a link between issues, click the link arrow and then click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/del-link.svg) **Delete link**.
