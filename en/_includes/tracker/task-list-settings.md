* To find issues in the list, enter text in the **Search by issue name** field.

* To change the layout of the issue list, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/flat-list.svg)&nbsp;**Flat list** or ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/tree-list.svg)&nbsp;**Tree list**.{#trees}

   {% note info %}

   In the tree list, nesting of issues is implemented as <q>Parent issue — Sub-issue</q> [links](../../tracker/user/links.md).

   {% endnote %}

   In the flat list, you can range (move) issues with respect to other issues. To do this, click and hold ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/range.svg) on the left of the issue and drag it where needed.

   In the tree list, you can create new sub-issues or change links for sub-issues:
   * To create a sub-issue, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/icon-add.svg) **Add sub-issue** next to the issue:
      * To create an issue, click the **New issue** tab. Edit the name and press **Enter**.
      * If the issue already exists, click **Existing issue** and specify the issue's key or name, then select the issue from the list. You can find the key on the issue page, under the title (for example, `TEST-1234`).
   * To change a link, click and hold ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/range.svg) to the left of the sub-issue, switch the toggle to the right, and drag the issue to the one you want to assign as a parent issue.
   * When building the issue hierarchy, you can nest issues into one another or move a sub-issue to a higher level. To move an issue one level up, click and hold ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/range.svg) to the left of a sub-issue and switch the toggle to the left.

   You can move issues manually if no sorting parameter is selected in the **Sort** field. By default, manual sorting mode is selected for the list of issues: you can drag issues in the list.
