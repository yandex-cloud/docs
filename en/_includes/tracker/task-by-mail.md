If the selected email server allows you to control access to the mailbox by an application password, enter the application's password for email clients in this field.

      1. Test the created connection.

   1. Specify the parameters to create issues from your email with: the issue type and [components](../../tracker/manager/components.md).

      1. In the **Login** field, specify the email address to send emails as issue comments from, e.g., `{{ example-account }}`.

      1. Test that everything is up and running: click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/send-email.svg) **Send a test email**.

   1. Click **Save**. The queue's email address will get running within an hour after creation.
