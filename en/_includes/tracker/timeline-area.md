Above the timeline on the right, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/gantt-settings-button.svg)&nbsp;**Chart settings** and select a setting in **Timeline area**:

* To have issues with the <q>Blocking â€” dependent</q> link joined with an arrow on the chart, select **Show blocking links**.

* To automatically move the deadline of the dependent issue when the blocking issue's deadline changes, select the appropriate option.

* To extend the deadline of the parent issue depending on its sub-issues' deadlines, select the appropriate setting.
