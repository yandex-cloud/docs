#### Maximum number of passages {#maxpassages}

A _passage_ is a fragment of found document that contains words from a search query. Passages are used to generate _snippets_ that are text annotations to found documents.

The `maxpassages` field defines the maximum number of passages that can be used when generating a document snippet.

Possible values are from 1 to 5. A search result may contain less passages than set by this parameter. By default, a maximum of four passages with search query text is returned per document.
