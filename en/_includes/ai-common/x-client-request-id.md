`X-Client-Request-ID` is a unique request ID. We recommend using a [UUID](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID). Send this ID to the technical support team so that we can find a specific request in the system and help you.

You can generate a UUID [online](https://uuid.js.org) or use the library for the programming language you are using.
