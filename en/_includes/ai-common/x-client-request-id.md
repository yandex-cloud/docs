`x-client-request-id` is a unique request ID. We recommend using a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID). Send this ID to the technical support team to help us find a specific request in the system and assist you.

You can generate a UUID either [online](https://uuid.js.org) or through the library for the programming language you use.
