It takes up to five minutes to create a VM and initialize the Windows operating system. Once the VM is created and ready to run, its status changes to `RUNNING`. You can monitor VM instance statuses in the list of VMs in your folder.

Depending on the characteristics of the VM, the first run and initialization of the RDP may take from 15 to 30 minutes.
