{% note info %}

It usually takes up to 6 minutes to start a VM and initialize Remote Desktop (RDP). In rare cases, loading may take much longer than the time specified. For example, when using:

* [VMs with less than 100% guaranteed vCPU performance](../compute/concepts/performance-levels.md).
* VMs that generate a load that exceeds the boot disk's [IOPS limit](../compute/concepts/limits.md#limits-disks).
* Network HDD drives with small storage capacity.
