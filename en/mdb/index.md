# Yandex MDB

MDB (Managed DataBases) is a group of services for managing databases with guaranteed resources, fault-tolerance, backups, charts, monitoring features, and the option to set up some things. Basically, it's the internal installation of what is provided as part of {{ yandex-cloud }}.

The functionality of internal services is not different from that of external ones. However, there are some important details that distinguish their use. Therefore, it's more reliable to read the internal documentation:

- [{{ mch-name }}](../managed-clickhouse/)
- [{{ mes-name }}](../managed-elasticsearch/)
- [{{ mkf-name }}](../managed-kafka/)
- [{{ mmg-name }}](../managed-mongodb/)
- [{{ mmy-name }}](../managed-mysql/)
- [{{ mpg-name }}](../managed-postgresql/)
- [{{ mrd-name }}](../managed-redis/)
