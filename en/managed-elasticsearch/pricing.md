# Pricing policy for Managed Service for Elasticsearch

{% include [currency-choice](../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}


## Cluster status {#running-stopped}

Pricing is applied differently depending on the cluster status:

* For a `Running` cluster, you pay both for the computing resources and storage size.
* For a `Stopped` cluster, you pay only for the storage size.

{% include [pricing-status-warning.md](../_includes/mdb/pricing-status-warning.md) %}


## What goes into the cost of using {{ mes-short-name }} {#rules}

The cost of {{ mes-name }} usage is based on:

* {{ ES }} edition used.

* Computing resources allocated to cluster hosts (including hosts with the `Master node` role).

* Storage type and size (disk space).

* Outgoing traffic from {{ yandex-cloud }} to the internet.

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### Using cluster hosts {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of operation of the host in accordance with the allocated computing resources and {{ ES }} edition used. Supported resource configurations are listed in the [{#T}](concepts/instance-types.md) section, prices for using vCPU and RAM — in the [Prices](#prices) section.

You can select the host class both for the hosts with the `Data node` role and hosts with the `Master node` role.

The minimum billing unit is a minute (for example, 1.5 minutes of host usage cost the same as 2 minutes). You are not charged for time when the {{ ES }} host is not performing its main functions.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

You pay for the storage allocated for DB clusters. The cost is specified for one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per minute (for example, storing 1 GB for 1.5 minutes costs the same as storing 1 GB for 2 minutes).
