# Managing access to {{ mes-name }}

{% if audience != "internal" %}

In this section, you'll learn:

* [Which resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

{% if audience != "internal" %}

To use the service, log in to the management console with a [Yandex account](../../iam/concepts/index.md#passport) or [federated account](../../iam/concepts/index.md#saml-federation).

## What resources you can assign roles to {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

To allow access to {{ mes-name }} service resources (clusters and hosts, cluster backups, and accounts), assign the user the appropriate roles for a folder or cloud hosting the resources.

## What roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

The diagram shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. For example, the `{{ roles-editor }}` role includes all the permissions of `{{ roles-viewer }}`. A description of each role is given under the diagram.

## Roles required {#required-roles}

To use the service, you need the `editor` [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) or higher to the folder where a cluster is created. The `viewer` role only enables you to view the cluster list.

You can always assign a role with more permissions. For example, assign the `admin` role instead of `editor`.
