# Deleting clusters

You can delete an {{ ES }} cluster if you no longer need it. All data in the cluster will be deleted.

- API

  To delete the cluster, use the `delete` API method: pass the ID of the desired cluster in the `clusterId` request parameter.

  To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
