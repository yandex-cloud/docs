# Deleting clusters

You can delete an {{ ES }} cluster if you no longer need it. All data in the cluster will be deleted.

## Before deleting a cluster {#before-you-delete}

* [Disable deletion protection](cluster-update.md#change-additional-settings) for the cluster if it is enabled.
* [Save the cluster ID](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

   {% include [backups-stored](../../_includes/mdb/backups-stored.md) %}

## Deleting the cluster {#delete}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder you want to delete a cluster from.
   1. Select the service **{{ mes-name }}**.
   1. Click the ![image](../../_assets/options.svg) icon for the desired cluster and select **Delete cluster**.
   1. Confirm cluster deletion and click **Delete**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To delete a cluster, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-es }} cluster delete <cluster name or ID>
   ```

   You can query the cluster ID and name with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

   Use the `delete` API method and pass the ID of the cluster to be deleted in the `clusterId` call parameter.

   To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

{% endlist %}
