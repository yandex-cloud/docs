# Managing backups in {{ mes-name }}


{{ mes-short-name }} enables you to create [index](../concepts/indexing.md) backups using both {{ yandex-cloud }} tools and the {{ ES }} snapshot mechanism. For more information about snapshots, see the [{{ ES }} documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/snapshot-restore.html).

## Creating backups with {{ yandex-cloud }} tools {#cloud-backups}


You can create [backups](../concepts/backup.md) and restore clusters from existing backups.

{{ mes-name }} also creates automatic hourly backups.


### Getting a list of backups {#list-backups}


{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   To get a list of cluster backups:
   1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mes-name }}**.
   1. Click the name of the cluster you need and select the **Backup copies** tab.

   To get a list of all backups in a folder:
   1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mes-name }}**.
   1. Click the **Backups** tab.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To get a list of {{ ES }} cluster backups available in the default folder, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-es }} backup list
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   +----------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
   |    ID    |      CREATED AT      |  SOURCE CLUSTER ID   |      STARTED AT      |
   +----------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
   | c9qlk... | 2020-08-10T12:00:00Z | c9qlk4v13uq79r9cgcku | 2020-08-10T11:55:17Z |
   | c9qpm... | 2020-08-09T22:01:04Z | c9qpm90p3pcg71jm7tqf | 2020-08-09T21:30:00Z |
   +----------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
   ```

- API

   To get a list of cluster backups, use the [listBackups](../api-ref/Cluster/listBackups.md) API method and provide the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter.

   To get a list of backups for all the {{ mes-name }} clusters in the folder, use the [list](../api-ref/Backup/list.md) API method and provide the folder ID in the `folderId` request parameter.

   You can get the cluster ID with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

{% endlist %}


### Getting information about backups {#get-backup}


{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   To get information about the backup of an existing cluster:
   1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mes-name }}**.
   1. Click the name of the cluster you need and select the **Backup copies** tab.

   To get information about the backup of a previously deleted cluster:
   1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mes-name }}**.
   1. Click the **Backups** tab.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To get information about a {{ ES }} cluster backup, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-es }} backup get <backup ID>
   ```

   You can retrieve the backup ID with a [list of backups](#list-backups).

- API

   Use the [get](../api-ref/Backup/get.md) API method and provide the backup ID in the `backupId` request parameter.

   To find out the ID, [retrieve a list of backups](#list-backups).

{% endlist %}


### Creating a backup {#create-backup}


{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mes-name }}**.
   1. Click the name of the cluster you need and select the **Backup copies** tab.
   1. Click **Create backup**.

   {% include [no-prompt](../../_includes/mdb/backups/no-prompt.md) %}

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To create a cluster backup:

   1. View a description of the CLI create {{ ES }} backup command:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-es }} cluster backup --help
      ```

   1. Request a backup to be created by specifying the cluster name or ID:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-es }} cluster backup <cluster ID or name>
      ```

      You can fetch the cluster ID and name with a [list of clusters](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

   Use the [backup](../api-ref/Cluster/backup.md) API method and provide the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter.

   You can get the cluster ID with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

{% endlist %}

{% include [backup-warning](../../_includes/mdb/backups/backup-create-warning.md) %}


### Restoring clusters from backups {#restore}


When you restore a cluster from a backup, you create a new cluster with data from the backup. If the folder has insufficient [resources](../concepts/limits.md) to create such a cluster, you will not be able to restore from the backup. You can manage the restore speed using [{{ ES }} tools](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/recovery.html).

When creating a new cluster, set all required parameters.

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   To restore an existing cluster from a backup:
   1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mes-name }}**.
   1. Click the name of the cluster you need and select the **Backup copies** tab.
   1. Click the ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) icon for the desired backup and click **Restore cluster**.
   1. Set up the new cluster. You can select a folder for the new cluster from the **Folder** list.
   1. Click **Restore cluster**.

   To restore a previously deleted cluster from a backup:
   1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mes-name }}**.
   1. Click the **Backups** tab.
   1. Find the desired backup using the backup creation time and cluster ID. The **Name** column contains the IDs in `<cluster ID>:<backup ID>` format.
   1. Click the ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) icon for the desired backup and click **Restore cluster**.
   1. Set up the new cluster. You can select a folder for the new cluster from the **Folder** list.
   1. Click **Restore cluster**.

   {{ mes-name }} launches the operation to create a cluster from the backup.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To restore a cluster from a backup:

   1. View a description of the CLI restore {{ ES }} cluster command:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-es }} cluster restore --help
      ```

   1. Getting a list of available {{ ES }} cluster backups:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-es }} backup list
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      +--------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
      |            ID            |      CREATED AT      |  SOURCE CLUSTER ID   |      STARTED AT      |
      +--------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
      | c9qlk4v13uq79r9cgcku...  | 2020-08-10T12:00:00Z | c9qlk4v13uq79r9cgcku | 2020-08-10T11:55:17Z |
      | ...                                                                                           |
      +--------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
      ```

      The time when the backup was completed is shown in the `CREATED AT` column of a list of available backups, in `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ` format (`2020-08-10T12:00:00Z` in the example above).

   1. Request the creation of a cluster from a backup:

      
      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-es }} cluster restore \
         --backup-id=<backup ID> \
         --name=<cluster name> \

## Backups using snapshots {#snapshot-backups}

To work with snapshots, use the [{{ ES }} public API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/snapshot-restore-apis.html) and a bucket in {{ objstorage-name }} to store them.

### Retrieving a snapshot list {#list-snapshots}

1. Find the repository containing snapshot backups in the {{ ES }} repository list:

   ```http
   GET https://admin:<password>@<host_FQDN_or_IP-address>:9200/_snapshot/_all
   ```

   If the desired repository is not on the list, [connect it](./s3-access.md).

1. Get a list of snapshots in the repository:

   ```http
   GET https://admin:<password>@<host_FQDN_or_IP_address>:9200/_snapshot/<repository>/_all
   ```

   Each snapshot is a single backup.


### Creating a snapshot {#create-snapshot}

1. In the {{ ES }} repository list, find the repository where you want to create the snapshot:

   ```http
   GET https://admin:<password>@<host FQDN_or_IP-address>:9200/_snapshot/_all
   ```

   If the desired repository is not on the list, [connect it](./s3-access.md).

1. [Create a snapshot](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/create-snapshot-api.html) of the desired data or cluster in the selected repository:

   ```http
   PUT https://admin:<password>@<host FQDN_or_IP-address>:9200/_snapshot/<repository>/<snapshot>
   ```

### Restoring a cluster from a snapshot {#restore-from-snapshot}

{% note warning %}

When restoring from snapshots, the following restrictions apply:

* The {{ ES }} version in the cluster must be equal to or higher than the {{ ES }} version where the snapshot was taken.
* To restore the indexes, be sure that the major {{ ES }} version in the cluster is no more than one unit higher than the major {{ ES }} version where the snapshot was taken. For example, you can use version 6.0 (but not 7.0) to recover indexes created in version 5.0.

{% endnote %}

1. [Create a new {{ ES }} cluster](./cluster-create.md) in the desired configuration, but don't populate it with data.

   When creating a cluster, select:

   * The number and class of hosts as well as the storage size and disk type based on snapshot size and performance requirements. If necessary, [upgrade your host class](./cluster-update.md#change-resource-preset) or [increase cluster storage size](./cluster-update.md#change-disk-size).

   * The {{ ES }} version used to make the snapshot or higher.

1. Close the open indexes using the [{{ ES }} API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-close.html):

   ```http
   POST: https://admin:<password>@<host FQDN_or_IP-address>:9200/<index>/_close
   ```

   To restore an entire cluster, close all open indices. To restore individual indices, close only those indices.

1. [Retrieve a list of backups](#list-snapshots) and find the desired snapshot.
1. [Start restoring](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/restore-snapshot-api.html) an entire cluster or individual data indexes and streams from the desired snapshot.

For more information about restoring from snapshots, see the [{{ ES }} documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/snapshots-restore-snapshot.html).
