# Managing {{ ES }} plugins

When creating or updating a cluster in {{ mes-short-name }}, you can specify a list of necessary plugins and they will be installed in the cluster automatically. A full list of available plugins is [given below](#elasticsearch).

## Retrieving a list of installed plugins {#list}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To get a list of cluster plugins, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-es }} cluster get <cluster ID or name>
   ```

   Enabled plugins will be shown in the `plugins` list.

   You can find out the cluster ID and name in the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

   Use the [get](../api-ref/Cluster/get.md) API method and pass the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter.

   Enabled plugins will be shown in the `plugins` list.

   You can get the cluster ID [with a list of clusters in a folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

{% endlist %}

## Editing a list of installed plugins {#update}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To edit cluster plugins, pass the plugin list in the CLI `--plugins` parameter. Plugins that are not included in the list will be disabled.

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-es }} cluster update <cluster ID or name> \
      --plugins=<plugin 1 name>,...,<plugin N name>
   ```

   You can find out the cluster ID and name in the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- {{ TF }}

   1. Open the current {{ TF }} configuration file with an infrastructure plan.

      For more information about creating this file, see [{#T}](cluster-create.md).

   1. In the {{ mes-name }} cluster description, add the `plugins` field with a list of plugins to the `config` block:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_mdb_elasticsearch_cluster" "<cluster name>" {
        ...
        config {
          ...
          plugins = [ "<list of plugin names>" ]
          ...
        }
        ...
      }
      ```

   1. Make sure the settings are correct.

      {% include [terraform-validate](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/validate.md) %}

   1. Confirm the update of resources.

      {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

   For more information, see the [{{ TF }} provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-mes }}).

- API

   Use the [update](../api-ref/Cluster/update.md) API method and pass the following in the request:

   * The cluster ID in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
   * The list of plugins in the `configSpec.elasticsearchSpec.plugins` parameter. Plugins that are not included in the list will be disabled.
   * List of cluster configuration fields to update in the `UpdateMask` parameter.

   {% include [Note API updateMask](../../_includes/note-api-updatemask.md) %}

{% endlist %}
