# Creating clusters

{{ mes-name }} cluster is a group of multiple linked {{ ES }} hosts. A cluster provides high search performance by distributing search and indexing tasks across all cluster hosts with the _Data node_ role. To learn more about roles in the cluster, see [{#T}](../concepts/index.md).

## Creating a cluster {#create-cluster}

When creating a cluster, parameters are specified separately for the hosts with the _Master node_ role and for the hosts with the _Data node_ role.

You can use hosts only with the _Data node_ role, without creating dedicated hosts for the _Master node_ role. In this case, hosts with the _Data node_ role combine the two roles.

- Management console

  1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a cluster.

  1. Select **{{ mes-name }}**.

  1. Click **Create cluster**.

  1. Under **Basic parameters**:
     1. Enter a name for the cluster and, if necessary, a description. The cluster name must be unique within the folder.
     1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you can't change the environment once the cluster is created):
        - `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
        - `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mes-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.
     1. Select the {{ ES }} version. The current version is `7.6`.

  1. Under **Network settings**, select [network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md).

  1. Under **User**, specify the settings for the user whose account will be used to connect to {{ ES }}: the username and password.

  1. Configure hosts with the _Data node_ role by opening the **Data node** tab:

     1. Under **Host class**, select the platform, host type, and host class.

        The host class defines technical characteristics of virtual machines on which {{ ES }} nodes are deployed. All available options are listed in [{#T}](../concepts/instance-types.md). When you change the host class for the cluster, the characteristics of all existing instances change, too.

     1. Under **Storage**:
        1. Select the type of storage, either a more flexible network type (**network-hdd** or **network-ssd**) or faster local SSD storage (**local-ssd**).
        1. Select the size of storage to be used for data. The size of the local storage can only be changed in 100 GB increments.

     1. Under **Hosts**, select the configuration of hosts created together with the cluster.
        1. To add a host, click **Add host**.
        1. To change the added host, hover over the host line and click ![image](../../_assets/pencil.svg).

          If you change the host, you can: {#change-data-node-settings}

          1. Select the availability zone and the subnet.

          1. Enable public access. If public access is enabled for the {{ ES }} host with the _Data node_ role, you can connect to this {{ ES }} host or Kibana located on the host over the internet. To learn more, see [{#T}](cluster-connect.md).

             {% include [mes-tip-public-kibana](../../_includes/mdb/mes-tip-connecting-to-public-kibana.md) %}

  1. If necessary, configure the hosts with the _Master node_ role by opening the **Master node** tab:

     1. Under **Host class**, select the platform, host type, and host class.

     1. Under **Storage**, configure storage in the same way as for hosts with the _Data node_ role.

     1. Under **Hosts**, click **Add hosts**. Three hosts are added. To change one of the added hosts, hover over the host line and click ![image](../../_assets/pencil.svg).

        If you change the host, you can: {#change-master-node-settings}

          1. Select the availability zone and the subnet.

          1. Enable public access.

             {% note tip %}

             It's not recommended to enable public access for hosts with the _Master node_ role. Change this setting only if you know exactly what you want to do.

             {% endnote %}

  1. Click **Create**.

- API

  To create a cluster, use the API `create` method and pass the following in the request:
    - In the `folderId` parameter, the ID of the folder where the cluster should be placed.
    - The cluster name, in the `name` parameter.
    - Cluster configuration, in the `configSpec` parameter, including:
        - Class of hosts with the _Master node_ role, in the `configSpec.elasticsearchSpec.masterNode.resources` parameter. If you don't want to create dedicated hosts with the _Master node_ role, do not set values for the group of `configSpec.elasticsearchSpec.masterNode` parameters.
        - Class of hosts with the _Data node_ role, in the `configSpec.elasticsearchSpec.dataNode.resources` parameter.
    - Configuration of the cluster hosts, in one or more `hostSpecs` parameters.
    - Network ID, in the `networkId` parameter.
