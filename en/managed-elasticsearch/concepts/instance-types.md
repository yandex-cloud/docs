# Host classes

The host class determines the computing power allocated for each host with the specific role in the cluster. When you change the host class for a role in the cluster, the characteristics change for all of the hosts with this role that were created earlier in the cluster. To learn more about roles, see [{#T}](./index.md).

{% if audience != "internal" %}

The available storage doesn't depend on the host class. For storage limitations, see [{#T}](limits.md).

{% endif %}

## Available host classes {#available-flavors}

Hosts in {{ mes-name }} clusters are deployed on {{ compute-full-name }} VMs. You can create these VMs on any standard platform that {{ compute-name }} supports. For a detailed description of the platforms, see [{#T}](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md).

The full list of possible host configurations on each platform is provided below.

Configuration types:

* **s2**: Standard configurations, with 4:1 GB RAM to vCPU ratio.
* **m2**: Configurations with an increased GB RAM to vCPU ratio (8:1). These configurations can be useful for clusters with increased cache requirements.
