# Backups

{{ mes-short-name }} supports automatic and manual [index](./indexing.md) backups.

A backup is automatically created every hour and stored for 7 days. You can't disable automatic backups or change the retention period.

To restore a cluster from a backup, [follow the instructions](../operations/cluster-backups.md#restore).

## Creating backups {#size}

You can create backups both automatically and [manually](../operations/cluster-backups.md#create-backup). After a backup is created, it's compressed for storage. The exact backup size isn't displayed.

Backups are only created on running clusters.

For more information on creating a backup manually, see [{#T}](../operations/cluster-backups.md).
