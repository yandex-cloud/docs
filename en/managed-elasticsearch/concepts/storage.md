# Storage types

{{ mes-name }} allows you to use network and local storage for clusters. Network storage is based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. Local storage is organized on disks, which are physically located on the cluster servers.

{% include [storage-type-nrd](../../_includes/mdb/storage-type-nrd.md) %}

## Local storage features {#local-storage-features}

* Local storage doesn't provide fault tolerance for a single-host cluster: if a local disk fails, the data is permanently lost. To ensure fault tolerance, create clusters of three or more hosts and configure index [sharding and replication](scalability-and-resilience.md).
* You are charged for a cluster with local storage even if it's stopped. Read more in the [pricing policy](../pricing.md).

## Non-replicated network storage features {#network-nrd-storage-features}
