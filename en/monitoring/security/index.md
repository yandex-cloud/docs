# Access management

Yandex.Cloud users can only perform operations on resources that are permitted under the roles assigned to them.
If a user doesn't have any roles assigned, almost all operations are forbidden.

To allow access to resources in the {{ monitoring-full-name }} service, assign the required roles to the user from the list below. Roles can currently only be assigned to parent resources (folders or clouds), whose roles are inherited by nested resources.

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see [{#T}](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation.

{% endnote %}

## Assigning roles {#grant-roles}

To assign a role to a user:

{% include [grant-role-console](../../_includes/grant-role-console.md) %}
