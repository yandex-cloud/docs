### Example of cost calculation {#example}

The cost of using {{ monitoring-short-name }} for 30 days while writing 20 metrics at a rate of **1 value per minute**:

> 20 * 1 * (60 * 24 * 30) = 864000 values = 0.864 million values
> 0.864 * $0.0784 = $0.0677376 = $0.07
>
> Total: $0.07

Where:

* 20 is the number of metrics.
* 1 is the number of values written per minute.
* (60 * 24 * 30) is the number of minutes in 30 days.
* $0.0784 is the cost of writing 1 million values (up to 50 million values).

The cost of using {{ monitoring-short-name }} for 30 days while writing 20 metrics at a rate of **1 value per second**:

> 20 * 1 * (60 * 60 * 24 * 30) = 51840000 values = 51.84 million values
> 50 * $0.0784 + (51.84 - 50) * $0.0448 = $4.00
>
> Total: $4.00

Where:

* 20 is the number of metrics.
* 1 is the number of values written per second.
* (60 * 60 * 24 * 30) is the number of seconds in 30 days.
* $0.0784 is the cost of writing 1 million values (up to 50 million values).
* $0.0448 is the cost of writing 1 million values (over 50 million values).

The cost of exporting 100 metrics from {{ monitoring-short-name }} to your own installation of the {{ prometheus-name }} monitoring system with a polling interval of **15 seconds** for 30 days:

> 100 * (60 / 15) * (60 * 24 * 30) = 17280000 values = 17.28 million values
> 17.28 * $0.0560 = $0.97
>
> Total: $0.97

Where:

* 100 is the number of metrics.
* (60 / 15) is the number of values read per minute.
* (60 * 24 * 30) is the number of minutes in 30 days.
* $0.0560 is the cost of reading 1 million values (up to 50 million values).

## Pricing {#prices}




The minimum billable unit is 1 metric value. The cost is rounded to the nearest cent.

For example, the cost of writing the first 100000 values is `(100000 values / 1 million) * $0.0784 = $0.00784`, which is rounded to `$0.01`. The cost of writing 150000 values is `(150000 values / 1 million) * $0.0784 = $0.01176`, which is rounded to `$0.01`. Where `$0.0784` is the cost per 1 million values (when writing up to 50 million values).
