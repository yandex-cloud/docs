## Questions about metric collection {#data-collection}

### How do I deliver my application metrics to {{ monitoring-full-name }}? { #1st-party-app }

{{unified-agent-full-name}} supports metric collection in the {{ prometheus-name }} format and metric conversion to the {{ monitoring-full-name }} format. That means you can use {{unified-agent-short-name}} to collect metrics from any application that provides them in the {{ prometheus-name }} format.

To deliver metrics from your application, use the [Prometheus client library](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/) for the programming language your application is written in.

You can find an example of how to configure metric delivery from a Python application in [{#T}](../operations/unified-agent/pull_prometheus.md).

### How do I deliver third-party app metrics to {{ monitoring-full-name }}? { #3rd-party-app }

To deliver metrics from third-party applications to {{ monitoring-full-name }}, use {{unified-agent-full-name}} with the `metrics_pull` input configured. That input periodically polls the third-party application directly (if the application supports metrics in the {{ prometheus-name }} format) or polls a special export application that integrates with {{ prometheus-name }}.
