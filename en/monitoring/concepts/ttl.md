# Deleting expired metrics (TTL)

In {{ monitoring-full-name }}, there are two types of metrics:

* Custom metrics.
* System metrics automatically collected from all active {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

Metrics for which no new values have been received for 30 days are considered expired and automatically deleted from {{ monitoring-full-name }}. Automatic deletion of expired metrics is run once a day.

After you delete a resource, the collection of its metrics stops. The metrics data of deleted resources continues to be available for 30 days. After this period, metrics are automatically deleted.

Custom metrics (`service: custom`) delivered through the Unified Agent are not deleted. If they are no longer being collected, contact [support]({{ link-console-support }}). Your storage quota will be increased or the retention period for such metrics will be reduced.

Some services have special conditions:

* For {{ managed-prometheus-name }}, there is a separate retention period [quota](../operations/prometheus/index.md#quotas-per-endpoint) for expired metrics.
* For {{ compute-full-name }}, expired metrics are stored for 7 days. For example, if your folder hosts a VM and you delete or stop it on `August 1, 2020`, its metrics will be available in {{ monitoring-full-name }} until `August 8, 2020`.

To set a shorter retention period, contact [support]({{ link-console-support }}).
