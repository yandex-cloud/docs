# Outputs

You can describe an output in the `routes` section within the `channel`:`output` element. Alternatively, you can do this in the named channel section, `channels`.

The common output description format is:

```yaml
- output:
    plugin: ... # plugin name
    id: ... # (recommended) output ID, which is used in metrics and agent logs
```

## debug output {#debug_output}

This is a debug output that outputs incoming messages to a file or console.

Given that the storage does not support local data view, you can set up data export to a file using this output. You can use the `logrotate` utility to set up log rotation. For the agent to start writing logs to a new file, use the `reopen_file` method. 

Configuration example:

```yaml
status:
  port: 16301

output:
  plugin: debug
  id: my_output_id
  config:
    file_name: ./data/output
    delimiter: "\n===\n"
    _test:
      register_test_handlers: true
```

Parameter descriptions:

```yaml
- channel:
    output:
        plugin: debug
        config:
            # Make sure to specify either the file_name or directory property.

            # Name of the file to write messages to.
            # To output data to the console, specify "/dev/stdout".
            file_name: out.txt  # optional, not set by default

            # Directory name. If specified, the data for each session is written to a separate file in this directory with a name equal to the session ID.
            directory: output_directory  # optional, not set by default

            # Message separator used in the file, for example, "\n".
            delimiter: null  # required
```

## dev_null output {#dev_null_output}

An empty debug output does not save incoming messages. There are no parameters.

## yc_metrics output {#yc_metrics_output}

An output used for writing metrics in the {{ monitoring-full-name }} API.

Parameter descriptions:

```yaml

        # Number of repeat attempts if the request failed.
        # If all the repeat attempts fail, i.e., no status 200 response is received, the message is discarded (for that message, an acknowledgement to the agent is generated).
        # Messages discarded this way are counted in the plugin's DroppedMessages counter. They are also displayed in the MessagesLost and BytesLost general health counters.
        retry_count: inf  # Optional, the default value is max_int (messages will not be discarded).

```


## yc_logs output {#yc_logs_output}

Output used for sending logs to [{{ cloud-logging-full-name }}](../../../../logging/) via [gRPC](../../../../logging/api-ref/grpc/LogIngestion/index.md).

{% note info %}

{{ unified-agent-short-name }} removes duplicate messages in the target system, but does not ensure there will be no duplicates at all. Duplicates may appear after a stop and subsequent restart.
