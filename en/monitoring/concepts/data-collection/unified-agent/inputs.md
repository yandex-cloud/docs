# Inputs

You can specify an input in the `routes`:`input` section. The common input description format is:

```yaml
- input:
    plugin: ... # plugin name
    id: ... # (recommended) ID of the input, used in metrics and logs
    flow_control: # session infrastructure settings
    ...
```

See also [Session infrastructure settings](services.md#flow_control).

## agent_metrics input {#agent_metrics_input}

The input collects health metrics for {{ unified-agent-full-name }}.

Parameter descriptions:

```yaml
- input:
    plugin: agent_metrics
    config:
      # Data source polling frequency.
      poll_period: 15s  # optional, the default value is 15 seconds

      # Namespace to place metrics into.
      # If specified, it will be added as a prefix to every metric name.
      namespace: null  # optional, not set by default
```

## metrics_pull input {#metrics_pull_input}

The input polls the specified URL at the preset intervals to collect metrics in {{ prometheus-name }} format.

Parameter descriptions:

```yaml
  - input:
      plugin: metrics_pull
      config:
        # Metric collection URL.
        url: http://localhost:12345  # required

        # Format of received messages. Only the prometheus value is currently supported.
        format:  # required
          # Incoming messages are in the prometheus format (https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/master/content/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md).
          prometheus: {}
        
        metric_name_label:  my_name  # optional, allows you to rename your application's name label because this name is reserved by the agent.

        # Data source polling frequency.
        # Start times are aligned to the grid of the poll_period size starting from the Unix epoch.
        poll_period: 15s  # optional, the default value is 15 seconds

        # Namespace to place the metrics in.
        # If specified, it will be added as a prefix followed by a dot to every metric name.
        namespace: null  # optional, not set by default

        # Number of repeat attempts if the request failed.
        retry_count: 0  # optional, the default value is 0

        # Interval between repeat attempts.
        retry_delay: 1s  # optional, the default value is 1 second

          h2: v2

        # Names of HTTP response headers to be saved to the message metadata.
        capture_response_headers: []  # optional, not set by default

        # HTTP method to use in the request.
        # The possible values are: GET, POST.
        http_method: GET  # optional, the default value is GET

        # Section for setting up {{ prometheus-name }} labels
        prometheus_config:  # optional, not set by default
          # Sets a `job` label value for labels being collected.
          job_name: my_job  # optional, not set by default
          # An `instance` label is generated automatically based on the URL.

    # Description of the output channel for metric delivery to {{ monitoring-name }}.
    # Use it together with prometheus_config.
    channel:
      output:
        plugin: metrics

          oauth:
            secret:
              file: file_token
```

`metric_name_label`: Decides which label the agent should write the metric name into for the {{ prometheus-name }} data. By default, the `name` label is used, which may cause a conflict if your app already uses this label. In which case you get this error when writing metrics:

```bash
label name 'name' is reserved
```

To avoid the error, specify any other unique name.

## linux_metrics input {#linux_metrics_input}

An input to collect system usage statistics (CPU, RAM, network, disk) for Linux-compatible operating systems. The input collects metric values from [procfs](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs) and [sysfs](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs).

{{ unified-agent-short-name }} collects metrics only from storage devices mounted as `/dev/..`. For example, there is no support for {{ compute-name }} [file storages](../../../../compute/concepts/filesystem.md).

{% note warning %}

If the agent is running in a Docker container, deliver the paths to procfs, sysfs, and disk mount points into the container in order to monitor the host's system metrics and secondary disks attached to the host. To do this, use the `docker run` command with the `-v` parameter. For example, if a secondary disk is mounted in the `/data` folder:

```bash
  docker run \
    -p 16241:16241 -it --detach --uts=host \
    --name=ua \
    -v /proc:/ua_proc \
    -v /data:/data \
    -e PROC_DIRECTORY=/ua_proc \
    -e FOLDER_ID=a1bs81qpemb4******** \
    {{ registry }}/yc/unified-agent
```

{% endnote %}

## file_input {#file_input}

This input reads data from text files and `.zst` archives. Your OS must support the `inotify` subsystem in the kernel and file system.

Rules for working with files:

* File external rotation based on the "move (rename) – create new file" scheme is supported. In `multiline` mode, lines with `multiline_start_prefix` will be considered the beginning of a multiline. All subsequent lines not containing this prefix are joined to the multiline.

* You can name a specific file or mask with the `multi_file` parameter as the data source.
  
  The `filename` key (file name without path) is added to the session metadata. To write the full path to the file into the metadata, use the `multi_add_full_path_to_meta` parameter.

* With the file for data writing, you can perform the operations of creating a file, writing new data to the end of the file, and rotation.
* Rotation implies moving a file; the file's location in the structure (inode) remains the same.
* The rotated file must remain unaltered for a certain period of time.

When working with archives:

* Archive format is detected automatically by the `.zst` extension or can be explicitly specified in the `file_format` parameter.
* We recommend breaking the archive into frames.
* The `read_only_newlines` parameter is ignored because it is not supported when working with an archive.
* To avoid CPU overconsumption and slowing down, we recommend enabling the `keep_open_file` parameter. Alternatively, you can set the `max_lines_in_record` parameter to a value commensurate with the size of each frame.

When working with files, information will be logged:

* If the `IN_Q_OVERFLOW` event is detected while reading events.
* {{ unified-agent-short-name }} stopping when deleting, moving, or unmounting folders containing the log file and rotated files.

## HTTP input {#http_input}

HTTP input for sending logs to Unified Agent. Logs are sent in the body of an HTTP request to the specified address. The input supports configuring the server host and port, the path for the handler, capturing request headers, and adding session metadata.

Parameter descriptions:

```yaml
- input:
    plugin: http
    config:
      # Host to run the HTTP server on.
      # By default, the HTTP server runs on all network interfaces.
      host: null  # optional, the default value is null

      # Port to run the HTTP server on.
      port: 22132  # required

      # Path the handler will be registered at.
      path: '/write'  # optional, the default value is '/write'

      # Names of HTTP request headers you need to save to the message metadata.
      capture_request_headers: []  # optional, not set by default

      # For each endpoint (from the _endpoints_ parameter below) a separate session is created.
      session_meta: # optional, not set by default
        k: v

      # Allows you to define multiple connection points with different parameters on one HTTP port.
      # You can specify any configuration elements except host, port, and endpoints.
      # If _endpoints_ is specified, the default connection point (/write) is not used.
      # In this mode, you can only specify the host, port, and endpoints elements in the configuration.
      endpoints:  # optional, the default value is []
        - path: '/my_path'  # required
          # Names of HTTP request headers you need to save to the message metadata.
