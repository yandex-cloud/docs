# Agent best practices

## One agent per host {#one-agent-per-host}

Avoid running more than one {{ unified-agent-short-name }} instance on the same host with the same configuration files since that might cause problems with the agent.

## Agent monitoring {#agent_metrics}

When using {{ unified-agent-short-name }}, we recommend that you enable collecting health metrics for the agent.

To do so, add a [delivery route](index.md#routes) with the `agent_metrics` input to the agent configuration. Configuration example:

```yaml
status:
  port: 16241

routes:
  - input:
      plugin: agent_metrics
      config:
        namespace: ua
    channel:
      pipe:
        - filter:
            plugin: filter_metrics
            config:
              match: "{scope=health}"
      output:
        plugin: yc_metrics
        config:
          folder_id: "$FOLDER_ID"
          iam:
            cloud_meta: {}
```

See also [{#T}](inputs.md#agent_metrics_input).

## Using the storage {#storage}

Use a storage to reliably deliver metrics to {{ monitoring-full-name }} with {{ unified-agent-short-name }}. It will let you temporarily store messages sent over a [pipe](index.md#pipes) before being passed on to the channel output.

Using a storage can help you avoid data loss if the agent fails to write the data to the specified output (including repeat attempts). This may happen due to network issues or destination API unavailability.

Example of agent configuration with a storage:

```yaml
status:
  port: 16241

storages:
  - name: main
    plugin: fs
    config:
      directory: /var/lib/yandex/unified_agent/main
      max_partition_size: 1gb
      max_segment_size: 500mb

channels:
  - name: cloud_monitoring
    channel:
      pipe:
        - storage_ref:
            name: main
      output:
        plugin: yc_metrics
        config:
          folder_id: <folder_ID>
          iam:
            cloud_meta: {}

routes:
  - input:
      plugin: linux_metrics
      config:
        poll_period: 15s
        namespace: sys
    channel:
      channel_ref:
        name: cloud_monitoring
```

## Calculation of CPU usage time {#cpu-time-tracking}

Before, to indicate the percentage of CPU usage on the chart, the `sys.system.CpuUsagePercent` metric was used. Linux no longer provides this metric; however, you can calculate it using the following two metrics:

* `sys.system.UsefulTime`: CPU active usage time.
* `sys.system.IdleTime`: CPU idle time.

To add a CPU usage percentage chart to a dashboard:

1. [Install and run](./installation.md) {{ unified-agent-short-name }}.
1. Open the dashboard you need or [create](../../../operations/dashboard/create.md) a new one.
1. In the upper-right corner, click ![square-plus](../../../../_assets/console-icons/square-plus.svg) and select ![chart-column](../../../../_assets/console-icons/chart-column.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.dashboard.widget-type.graph }}** to add a new widget to the dashboard.
1. In the new widget, create three requests in text mode (the ![code](../../../../_assets/console-icons/code.svg) icon):

    1. `UsefulTime` request:

        ```text
        "sys.system.UsefulTime"{folderId = "<folder_ID>", service = "custom", cpu  = "-"}
        ```

        Where `<folder_ID>` is the [ID](../../../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) of the folder your dashboard is located in.

        Click the ![eye](../../../../_assets/console-icons/eye.svg) icon to hide this metric from the chart.
    1. `IdleTime` request:

        ```text
        "sys.system.IdleTime"{folderId = "<folder_ID>", service = "custom", cpu = "-"}
        ```

        Where `<folder_ID>` is the [ID](../../../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) of the folder your dashboard is located in.

        Click the ![eye](../../../../_assets/console-icons/eye.svg) icon to hide this metric from the chart.
    1. `CpuUsagePercent` request:

        ```text
        100 * UsefulTime / (IdleTime + UsefulTime)
        ```
1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.querystring.action.execute-query }}** and make sure you can see the chart with CPU usage.
1. In the upper-right corner, click ![floppy-disk.svg](../../../../_assets/console-icons/floppy-disk.svg) to save your widget.
