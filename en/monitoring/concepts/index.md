# {{ monitoring-name }} overview

{{ monitoring-name }} allows you to collect and store metrics and display them as charts on dashboards.

{{ monitoring-name }} automatically collects data on the status of your resources in {{ yandex-cloud }} and displays them on service dashboards. You can use the API to upload custom metrics.

With {{ monitoring-name }}, you can:
* Track the status of your services in {{ yandex-cloud }} on service dashboards. This way, you can monitor the current resource usage and plan a [quota]({{ link-console-quotas }}) increase.
* Upload your own metrics using the API. You can place the metrics of your application and the metrics of {{ yandex-cloud }} resources it uses on a single dashboard.
* Download resource metrics and custom metrics using the API.
* Create custom dashboards and charts to display metrics in a way convenient for you.
* Set up alerts for metric changes. Multiple notification channels are available.
* Configure an escalation policy to define the order of notifications for critical metric changes.

## How {{ monitoring-name }} works {#how-it-works}

{{ monitoring-name }} collects and stores metrics as [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series). The service uses labels to identify and describe the time series characteristics. Labels map metrics to services, provide metric definitions, etc. For more information, see [{#T}](data-model.md).

{{ monitoring-name }} displays metrics on charts. You can place a large number of interrelated charts on dashboards. For more information, see [{#T}](visualization/index.md).

## Delivering {{ managed-k8s-full-name }} cluster metrics {#metrics-provider}

{{ monitoring-name }} enables you to export [{{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#kubernetes-cluster) object metrics. The provider converts a request to get external metrics from a {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster object to the format required by {{ monitoring-name }} and also performs the reverse conversion: from {{ monitoring-name }} to a cluster object.

{% include [metrics-k8s-tools](../../_includes/managed-kubernetes/metrics-k8s-tools.md) %}

The metrics are described in the [Reference](../metrics-ref/index.md#managed-kubernetes).
