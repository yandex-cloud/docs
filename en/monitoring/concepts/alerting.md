# Alerting

Alerting in {{ monitoring-full-name }} allows notifying cloud users of changes to metrics. For example, you can set up alerts about changes in your cloud resource status and timely respond to an issue.

Alerting tracks changes to certain metrics using [alerts](alerting/alert.md) and sends notifications via a [notification channel](./alerting/notification-channel.md).
