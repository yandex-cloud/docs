# Getting started with {{ monitoring-full-name }}

This guide explains how to create a dashboard and add widgets that display the status of {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

{% note info %}

{{ monitoring-full-name }} automatically creates service dashboards with a set of widgets that display the status of your cloud resources.

If you don't have any resources, create them (for example, a {{ CH }} VM and cluster) to get started with the service.

## Create a new dashboard {#create-dashboard}

1. On the [home page](https://monitoring.cloud.yandex.com) of the service, click **Create dashboard**.
1. Click **Add** in the upper-right corner of the menu and select **Heading**.
1. In the text field, enter **Cross-service dashboard**.
1. Click **Add**.
1. Drag the created widget to the appropriate place on the dashboard.

## Add a widget of {{ compute-full-name }} {#add-compute-widget}

1. On the dashboard editing page, click **Add** in the upper-right part of the menu and select **New chart**.
1. Configure a new chart that shows CPU load on all the VMs in the folder by specifying the `cpu_usage` metric of the {{ compute-full-name }} service in the query. To do this, select the following labels in the query constructor:
    - `service=Compute Cloud`
    - `name=cpu_usage`
    - `resource_id=*`
    - `resource_type=vm`
1. Click **Save**. The widget is displayed on the dashboard.

## Add a widget of {{ managed-clickhouse-full-name }} {#add-clickhouse-widget}

1. On the dashboard editing page, click **Add** in the upper-right part of the menu and select **New chart**.

1. Configure a new chart that shows the amount of free space on {{ managed-clickhouse-full-name }} cluster VMs by specifying the `disk.free_bytes` metric in the query. To do this, select the following labels in the query constructor:
    - `service=Managed Service for ClickHouse`
    - `name=disk.free_bytes`
    - `host=*`
    - `resource_id=*`
    - `resource_type=cluster`

1. Click **Save**. The widget is displayed on the dashboard.

1. Click ![gear](../_assets/monitoring/gear.svg) to open the widget configuration modal window.

1. In the **Heading** parameter, enter a name for the widget. For example, Free space on ClickHouse hosts.
