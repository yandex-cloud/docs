# Reading metrics via the Remote API

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the data is stored.
1. [Create a service account](../../../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) with the `{{ roles-monitoring-viewer }}` role for the selected folder.
1. [Create an API key](../../../../iam/operations/authentication/manage-api-keys.md#create-api-key) for the service account.
1. Add the endpoint (`url`) to the `remote_read` section of the [Prometheus configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_read):
   ```yaml
   ...
   remote_read:
     ...
     - url: '<URL>' # You can get it upon request.
       bearer_token: '<API_key>'
       # Alternatively, you can use a file (recommended):
       # bearer_token_file: '<name_of_file_with_API_key>'

       # We recommend adding the `X-Lookback-Delta` custom header.
       # If you did not change the `lookback-delta` value in
       # your Prometheus instance configuration, specify the default value, `5m`.
       # This information is required for optimized decimation.
       headers:
         X-Lookback-Delta: 5m

       # The default behavior limits data queries to time ranges
       # missing from the Prometheus local storage (usually those beyond the storage retention).
       # If your reads and writes use different Prometheus instances,
       # consider enabling the following option to always fetch data:
       # [ read_recent: true ]

       # If you only want to read specific metrics via the Remote API, provide their labels:
       # required_matchers:
       # [ <label_name>: <label_value> ... ]
   ```
1. Restart {{ prometheus-name }} or reload the configuration.
