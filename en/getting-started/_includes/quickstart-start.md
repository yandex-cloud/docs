# Getting started

The {{ yandex-cloud }} platform has several user interfaces, such as the [management console] ({{ link-console-main }}) and the [command line interface](../../cli/). To access any user interface, you will need a _user account_. This can be a personal Yandex account (Yandex ID) or a Yandex 360 account. For detailed instructions, see the Help for [Yandex ID]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://yandex.ru/support/passport/authorization/registration.html){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://yandex.com/support/passport/authorization/registration.html){% endif %} and [YandexÂ 360]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://yandex.ru/support/business/add-users.html){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://yandex.com/support/business/add-users.html){% endif %}.
