# Getting started

The {{ yandex-cloud }} platform has several user interfaces, such as the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and the [command line interface](../../cli/). To access any user interface, you will need a _user account_. This can be a personal Yandex account (Yandex ID) or a Yandex.Connect account. For detailed instructions, see Help for [Yandex ID]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://yandex.ru/support/passport/authorization/registration.html){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://yandex.com/support/passport/authorization/registration.html){% endif %} and [Yandex.Connect]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://yandex.ru/support/connect/personal.html#personal__section_aq5_hcq_23b){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://yandex.com/support/connect/personal.html#personal__section_aq5_hcq_23b){% endif %}.
