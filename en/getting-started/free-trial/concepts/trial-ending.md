# End of trial period

The trial period terms of termination differ for individual and business accounts.

{% list tabs %}

- For individual accounts

   The trial period ends automatically when you use up the grant or a [part](../../usage-grant.md) of the grant, or when it expires.

- For business accounts

   Automatic termination of the trial period depends on the payment method you select when [creating your billing account](../../../billing/quickstart/index.md).

   | Payment method | Terms of termination |
   | ----- | ----- |
   | Bank transfer | The grant was used up or expired. |
   | Bank card | The grant or a [part](../../usage-grant.md) of the grant was used up or it expired. |

{% endlist %}

If the free trial ends and you don't upgraded to the paid version, access to your resources will be suspended for 30 days:
* Your VM instances and DB clusters will be stopped.
* You will not be able to read or download any saved data.

You can restore access to your resources if you upgrade to the paid version within 30 days after the end of the trial period. Otherwise, all resources in your cloud will be permanently deleted.
