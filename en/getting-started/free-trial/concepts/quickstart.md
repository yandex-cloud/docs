# How does the trial period work

{% include [free-trial-conditions](../../../_includes/free-trial-conditions.md) %}

The trial period allows you to use {{ yandex-cloud }} resources for free with some limitations. Consumed resources are paid for from the [initial grant](../../usage-grant.md). After the end of the trial period, the resources are kept but discontinued. To resume working with {{ yandex-cloud }}, you need to fully upgrade to the paid version.

The balance of the initial grant and the number of days until the end of the trial period are displayed in the billing account on the [Billing]({{ link-console-billing }}) page. During the trial period, you can also [view statistics](../../../billing/operations/check-charges.md) on resource usage and charges based on the usage rate.

{% note warning %}

You can only enable the trial period when [creating your first billing account](../../../billing/quickstart/index.md) in the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console. To do this, click **Activate trial period**.


If you do not meet the trial period terms of use, you will not see the **Activate trial period** button. For more information about the terms, see [{#T}](../../individuals/registration.md#new-account).


If you do not activate the trial period at this time, your account will be created as a paid account. In this case, you will not have to upgrade to the paid version after using up the initial grant.
