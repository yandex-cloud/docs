# Upgrading to the paid version

You do not upgrade to the paid version automatically after the trial period ends. To upgrade to the paid version, go to [{{ billing-name }}]({{ link-console-billing }}), open the billing account page and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.dashboard.button_go-pay}}**. You can upgrade to the paid version during the trial period or 60 days after it expires with no data loss.

{% note info %}


We recommend you to keep track of the money you spend from your personal account and maintain a positive balance manually. If you fail to pay the arrears within the timeline set forth in the agreement, {{ yandex-cloud }} reserves the right to change the status of your billing account to `SUSPENDED`.

To control spending on {{ yandex-cloud }} resources more effectively, we recommend using a [budget](../../../billing/concepts/budget.md).

{% endnote %}

## Using the remainder of the initial grant

{% include [billing-how-to-use-grant](../../../_includes/billing-how-to-use-grant.md) %}

The grant terms of use remain in effect after the upgrade.



The remainder of the grant can be used to pay for any {{ yandex-cloud }} services.


## Paying for services

In {{ yandex-cloud }}, you pay for services based on the amount of resources consumed. For detailed guidelines on how to pay for resources after upgrading to the paid version, see the {{ billing-name }} [documentation](../../../billing/).
