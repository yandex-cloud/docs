# Configure a service plan


{{ yandex-cloud }} provides technical support under different service plans. You can choose the one that best suits you. The cost of paid technical support plans includes two components: fixed and supplemental. The fixed portion only depends on the selected plan, while the supplemental portion is calculated as a fraction of the cost of the resources used over the month. For more information about the plans, see the [Pricing policy](../../support/pricing.md).

{% include [account_scope.md](../../billing/_includes/account-scope.md) %}

By default, all users are offered the free basic service plan. To change your service plan:
