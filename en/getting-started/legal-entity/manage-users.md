# Managing users

The guide in this checklist item will help you add users to your created organization, appoint an administrator, and set user roles.

## Add a Yandex user {#add-user-yandex}

If your employees have Yandex accounts, e.g., `login@yandex.ru`, they can use them to access {{yandex-cloud}} services enabled in your organization.

To add employee accounts to the organization, follow these steps:

1. [Log in]({{ link-passport-login }}) to the organization's administrator account.
1. Go to [{{ org-full-name }}]({{ link-org-main }}).
1. In the left-hand panel, select [Users](https://org.cloud.yandex.ru/users) ![icon-users](../../_assets/organization/icon-users.svg).
1. In the top-right corner, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.page.users.action.invite-users }}**.
1. Enter the email addresses of the Yandex users you want to invite to the organization (for example, `login@yandex.ru`).
1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.entity.invitation.action_send-invitation }}**. The users will be added to the organization when they accept the invitation to join.

To access the organization's enabled services, invited users simply need to log in to their Yandex account.

## Add federated users {#add-user-sso}

To add federated users, you need to know the Name IDs of the users that the Identity Provider Server (IdP) returns in the authentication successful response. This is usually the user's primary email address. If you do not know what the server returns as the Name ID, contact the administrator who configured authentication for your federation.

To add federation users to an organization:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. [Log in]({{ link-passport-login }}) to the organization's administrator account.
   1. Go to [{{ org-full-name }}]({{ link-org-main }}).
   1. In the left-hand panel, select [Users](https://org.cloud.yandex.ru/users) ![icon-users](../../_assets/organization/icon-users.svg).
   1. In the top right corner, click ![icon-users](../../_assets/datalens/arrow-down.svg) â†’ **Add federated users**.
   1. Select the identity federation to add users from.
   1. List the Name IDs of users, separating them with line breaks.
   1. Click **Add**. This will give the users access to the organization.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View a description of the add user command:

   ```
   yc organization-manager federation saml add-user-accounts --help
   ```

   1. Add users by listing their Name IDs separated by a comma:

   ```
   yc organization-manager federation saml add-user-accounts --name my-federation \
   --name-ids=alice@example.com,bob@example.com,charlie@example.com
   ```

- API

   To add identity federation users to the cloud:

   1. Create a file with the request body, e.g., `body.json`. In the request body, specify the array of Name IDs of users you want to add:

   ```json
   {
   "nameIds": [
     "alice@example.com",
     "bob@example.com",
     "charlie@example.com"
   ]
   }
   ```
   1. Send the request by specifying the Federation ID in the parameters:

   ```bash
   $ curl -X POST \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <IAM token>" \
   -d '@body.json' \
   https://iam.api.cloud.yandex.net/iam/v1/saml/federations/<federation ID>:addUserAccounts
   ```

{% endlist %}

## Assign roles to the users {#add-role}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   In the management console, you can only assign a role for a cloud or folder:

   {% include [grant-role-console](../../_includes/grant-role-console.md) %}


- CLI

   1. Choose a role from the list in [Roles](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md).
   1. [Get the user ID](../../organization/users-get.md).
   1. Assign the role using the command:

   ```
   yc <SERVICE-NAME> <RESOURCE> add-access-binding <RESOURCE-NAME>|<RESOURCE-ID> \
     --role <ROLE-ID> \
     --subject userAccount:<USER-ACCOUNT-ID>
   ```

   Where:

   * `<SERVICE-NAME>` is the name of the service that the resource belongs to (for example, `resource-manager`).
   * `<RESOURCE>` is the resource category, for example, `cloud`.
   * `<RESOURCE-NAME>` is the name of the resource. You can specify a resource by its name or ID.
   * `<RESOURCE-ID>` is the resource ID.
   * `<ROLE-ID>` is the role ID, for example `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}`.
   * `<USER-ACCOUNT-ID>` is the ID of the user account assigned the role.

   For example, assign the `viewer` role for the `mycloud` [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder):

   ```
   $ yc resource-manager cloud add-access-binding mycloud \
     --role viewer \
     --subject userAccount:aje6o61dvog2h6g9a33s
   ```

- API

   Use the `updateAccessBindings` method for the corresponding resource.

   1. Choose a role from the list in [Roles](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md).
   1. [Get the user ID](../../organization/users-get.md).
   1. Create a request body, for example, in a `body.json` file. Set the `action` property to `ADD` and specify the `userAccount` type and user ID in the `subject` property:

   **body.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "accessBindingDeltas": [{
       "action": "ADD",
       "accessBinding": {
         "roleId": "editor",
         "subject": {
           "id": "gfei8n54hmfhuk5nogse",
           "type": "userAccount"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   1. {% include [grant-role-folder-via-curl-step](../../_includes/iam/grant-role-folder-via-curl-step.md) %}

{% endlist %}


## Appoint an administrator {#admin}

To grant a user organization management permissions, assign them one of the following roles:

* `organization-manager.admin`: Organization administrator role.

   The role allows you to edit organization settings, create identity federations, add and remove users, create other administrators, and manage the resources of an organization's clouds.

* `organization-manager.organizations.owner`: The organization owner role.

   The role lets you to appoint organization owners as well as use all the administrator privileges.

   By default, the user who creates an organization is the organization owner.

* `organization-manager.viewer`: This role lets you view, but not edit, an organization's settings.
