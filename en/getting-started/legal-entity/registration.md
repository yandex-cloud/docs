# Creating a billing account

A billing account is required even if your plan is to use only free services. When creating your first billing account linked to your user account, you will get your [initial grant](../usage-grant.md).

{% note warning %}

The initial grant will be credited only if you link a credit/debit card to the billing account when creating it.
