# Getting started with {{ yandex-cloud }}

To get access to {{ yandex-cloud }}, a system administrator should submit a request. If the request is approved, they are granted access to the management console and can create accounts for other employees of your company.

## Step 1. Filling out the application form {#leave-request}

To submit a request:

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Get started** and then click **Log in using Google** in the window that opens.

   You'll see the Google authentication window.

1. Log in.

   {% note alert %}

   The account you're authenticating with will be used to log in to the console. It will be assigned the [organization owner](../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#owner) role. The organization owner creates accounts for all other employees, manages these accounts, sets up access permissions, and enables/disables services.

   {% endnote %}

   Select or specify the desired account.

1. Read the [Privacy Policy](../legal/privacy.md) and [Terms of Use](../legal/terms.md) and consent to receive marketing materials and other messages from {{ yandex-cloud }}.

1. Click **Log in**.

   This opens the application form.

1. Fill out the form.

   Enter your full name, your corporate email address, and a contact phone number as well as your organization information. Also describe how you intend to use {{ yandex-cloud }} services. This information will help us make a decision on whether to reject or accept your request.

1. Click **Send request**.

As soon as we review your request, you'll receive a message to your organization's corporate email address notifying you of the results and providing further instructions.

## Step 2. First log-in to the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console {#cloud-init}

After your request is approved, log in to the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) with the same Google account as you used when filling out the application form.

This opens a window where you can create your first cloud. If necessary, edit the cloud name and click **Create**. This automatically creates an organization in {{ yandex-cloud }}. [Learn more about organizations in {{ yandex-cloud }}](../organization).

At the [Preview](../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage, the following limitation applies: only one organization and one cloud are available.
