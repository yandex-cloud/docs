# Set up a service plan

{{ yandex-cloud }} provides technical support under different service plans. You can choose the plan that's best for you. The cost of paid technical support plans includes two components: fixed and supplemental. The fixed portion only depends on the selected plan, while the supplemental portion is calculated as a fraction of the cost of the resources used over the month. For more information about plans, see the [Pricing policy](../../support/pricing.md).

By default, all users are offered the free basic service plan. To change your service plan:

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-support }}), go to the **Pricing plan** tab.
1. Select a service plan and click **Switch**.
1. To change to:
   * Any service plan except Premium, click **Confirm**.
   * The Premium plan, complete the form and click **Send**.

Service plan upgrades are activated immediately, while downgrades are applied on the first day of the following month.
