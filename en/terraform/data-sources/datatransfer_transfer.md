## Arguments & Attributes Reference

- `data_objects` [Block]. package: yandex.cloud.datatransfer.v1
filename: yandex/cloud/datatransfer/v1/transfer.proto

  - `include_objects` (List Of String). package: yandex.cloud.datatransfer.v1
filename: yandex/cloud/datatransfer/v1/transfer.proto

- `description` (String). Description of the transfer.
- `folder_id` (String). ID of the folder to create the transfer in.
 
 To get the folder ID, make a
 [yandex.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.FolderService.List] request.
- `id` (String). Identifier of the transfer to be returned.
 
 To get the list of all available transfers, make a [List] request.
- `labels` (Map Of String). Transfer labels as `key:value` pairs.
 
 For details about the concept, see [documentation]( api-url-prefix
 /resource-manager/concepts/labels).
- `name` (String). The transfer name. Must be unique within the folder.
- `on_create_activate_mode` (String). Activation action on create a new incremental transfer. It is not part of the transfer parameter and is used only on create. One of `sync_activate`, `async_activate`, `dont_activate`. The default is `async_activate`.
- `regular_snapshot` [Block]. Regular snapshots for the transfer, applicable only if transfer type is
 SNAPSHOT_ONLY
  - `disabled` [Block]. package: yandex.cloud.datatransfer.v1
filename: yandex/cloud/datatransfer/v1/transfer.proto

  - `settings` [Block]. package: yandex.cloud.datatransfer.v1
filename: yandex/cloud/datatransfer/v1/transfer.proto

    - `cron_expression` (String). Use a cron expression to schedule transfer regular snapshots in UTC time. 
 The used cron expression format is 5 columns specifying the execution time
 (minute, hour, day, month, day of the week), 
 they can contain a numeric list separated by commas, a range of numbers
 separated by a hyphen, symbols * or /.
 only one of schedule or cron_expression should be set
    - `increment_delay_seconds` (Number). Wait for transaction completion time, in seconds
 Set load delay time to insure that current transactions on source are completed
 and thus full data is visible for snapshot. 
 This may be useful if source cannot guarantee that cursor values grows
 monotonically - 
 due to transaction race or well-known problem that serial id sequence does not
 actually guarantee the order

 If not empty, each snapshot will copy only data changed since last snapshot
 based on cursor column value.
