  name      = "test-registry"
  folder_id = "test_folder_id"

  labels = {
    my-label = "my-label-value"
  }
}

resource "yandex_cloudregistry_registry_ip_permission" "my_ip_permission" {
  registry_id = yandex_cloudregistry_registry.my_registry.id
  push        = ["10.1.0.0/16", "10.2.0.0/16", "10.3.0.0/16"]

## Schema

### Required

- `registry_id` (String) The ID of the registry that IP restrictions are applied to.

### Optional

- `pull` (Set of String) List of configured CIDRs from which `pull` operations are allowed.
- `push` (Set of String) List of configured CIDRs from which `push` operations are allowed.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
