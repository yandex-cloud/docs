# Data requests

Regardless of your [service plan](overview.md), you can request from the technical support:

* Log records from {{ yandex-cloud }} services about your resources.

   Technical support collects the data for you, and within a month of the request, gives you access to your {{ objstorage-full-name }} log archive.

* Your personal data stored by Yandex and any information about this data.

   You can also request to have your personal data completely deleted.

* Information about critical security procedures, including the information security policy and access control policy for user data and service source code. The {{ yandex-cloud }} information security service can only provide this information after you sign a non-disclosure agreement.

To make any of these requests, contact technical support using this [management console form]({{ link-console-support }}) or by email at [{{ link-support-mail }}](mailto:{{ link-support-mail }}).
