# Data requests

Regardless of your [service plan](overview.md), you can request the following from technical support:

* Log records from Yandex.Cloud services about your resources.

  Technical support collects the data for you, and within a month of the request, gives you access to your {{ objstorage-full-name }} log archive.

* Your personal data stored by Yandex and any information about this data.

  You can also request to have your personal data completely deleted.

* Information about critical security procedures, including the information security policy and access control policy for user data and service source code. The Yandex.Cloud information security service can only provide this information after you sign a non-disclosure agreement.

To make any of these requests, contact support using [the form in the management console](https://console.cloud.yandex.com/support) or by email at [cloud@support.yandex.ru](mailto:cloud@support.yandex.ru).
