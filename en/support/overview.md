# Requesting technical support

{{ yandex-cloud }} provides technical support under different service plans. You can choose the plan that's best for you. The cost of paid technical support plans includes two components: fixed and supplemental. The fixed portion only depends on the selected plan, while the supplemental portion is calculated as a fraction of the cost of the resources used over the month. For more information about plans, see the [Pricing policy](pricing.md).

## Contacting support {#response-time}

Depending on your pricing plan, you can [contact technical support]({{ link-console-support }}) using one of the methods below:

{% include [support-channels](../_includes/support/channels.md) %}

If there is a problem with your infrastructure's production environment, specify _Critical issue_ as your request type.

The expected support specialist response time is shown in the table below. A dash in a table cell means the corresponding communication channel is not available for the selected service plan.
