# Requesting technical support



{{ yandex-cloud }} provides technical support under different service plans. You can choose the plan that's best for you. The cost of paid technical support plans includes two components: fixed and supplemental. The supplemental part is calculated as a percentage of the cost of resources used for the month. For more information about plans, see the [Pricing policy](pricing.md).


## Contacting support {#response-time}



Depending on your service plan, you can [contact technical support]({{ link-console-support }}) using one of the methods below:

{% include [support-channels](../_includes/support/channels.md) %}

If there is a problem with your infrastructure's production environment, specify _Critical issue_ as your request type.



The expected support specialist response time is shown in the table below. A dash in a table cell means the corresponding communication channel is not available for the selected service plan.

| Channel | Basic | Business | Premium |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                           | For personal and research projects | For professional projects | For business projects with stringent fault tolerance requirements. |
