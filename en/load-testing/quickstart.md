# Getting started with {{ load-testing-full-name }}

This guide will help you create a test agent in your cloud, configure a simple load test, and view the result.

## Getting started

1. Log in to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). If you do not yet have an account, go to the management console and follow the instructions.
   1. [On the billing page]({{ link-console-billing }}), make sure you linked a [billing account](../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you do not yet have a billing account, [create one](../billing/quickstart/index.md).
1. If you do not have any folder, [create one](../resource-manager/operations/folder/create.md). While creating a folder, you can also create a default virtual network with subnets in all availability zones.
1. Create a [service account](../iam/operations/sa/create.md) in the folder to host the agents that will generate the load. [Assign](../iam/operations/roles/grant.md) it the `loadtesting.generatorClient` [role](./security/#roles-list).
1. The agent connects to {{ load-testing-name }} using a public API. For security purposes, [create a security group](../vpc/operations/security-group-create.md). To connect to the control service, make sure the agent allows outgoing traffic to port 443. To do this, [add the following rule](../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) for outgoing traffic to your security group:
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-port-range }}**: `443`.
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-protocol }}**: `TCP`.
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-destination }}**: `CIDR`.
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-cidr-blocks }}**: `0.0.0.0/0`.

   {% include [security-groups-note](../_includes/vpc/security-groups-note-services.md) %}

1. The agent will need access to the subnet hosting the test target. For the agent to be able to connect to {{ load-testing-name }}, set up a [NAT gateway](../vpc/operations/create-nat-gateway.md) for the subnet.
1. If you do not have an SSH key pair yet, [create them](../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys).

## Create an agent {#create-agent}

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you want to create your agent.
1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_load-testing }}**.
1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_agents-list }}** tab, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.button_create-agent }}**.
1. Give your agent the `test-agent` name.
1. Specify the same availability zone where the test target is located.
1. Select the appropriate agent type. For more information, see [Agent performance](concepts/agent.md#benchmark).
1. Specify the subnet where the test target is located. Make sure you [created and set up a NAT gateway](../vpc/operations/create-nat-gateway.md) in the subnet.
1. If security groups are available to you, select a preset group.
1. Select the service account with the `loadtesting.generatorClient` role. You must have the [permission to use it](../iam/operations/sa/set-access-bindings.md).
1. Enter a username. It will be created on the VM.
1. Paste the contents of the [public key](../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#copy-key) file.
1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.create }}**.
1. Wait for the VM to start. Make sure the agent status changes to `Ready for test`.

This creates a VM in your folder that you will be able to use to load test targets in the selected subnet.

## Running a test {#run-test}

This example will test a service located at `example.myservice.ru`.

We will use Pandora as load generator, since it is best suited for testing cloud applications.

1. Open the ![image](../_assets/load-testing/test.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_tests-list }}** tab in **{{ load-testing-name }}**. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.button_create-test }}**. Set the test parameters:
   1. **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_agents-list }}**: Select `test-agent`.
   1. **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.field_settings-type }}**: Select `{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_settings-type-form }}`.
   1. **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.field_load-generator }}**: Select `Pandora`.
   1. **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.field_target-address }}**: Enter the address of the service to test: `example.myservice.ru`.
   1. **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.field_target-port }}**: Set to `80` (default HTTP port).
   1. **Testing threads**: `1000`.
      This means that the load generator can simultaneously process 1000 operations (create 1000 connections or wait for 1000 responses from the service at the same time).

      {% note warning %}

      Make sure the agent has access to `example.myservice.ru:80`.

      {% endnote %}

   1. **Load type**: Select `RPS`.
   1. Add a **Load profile**:
      * **Profile 1**: Select `line`.
      * **From**: Set `1`.
      * **To**: Set `100`.
      * **Duration**: Specify `60s`.
   1. Add another **Load profile**:
      * **Profile 2**: Select `const`.
      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_rps }}**: Set `100`.
      * **Duration**: Specify `300s`.

      This instructs the generator to increase the load from 1 to 100 requests per second for the first 60 seconds, and then maintain a load of 100 requests per second for 5 minutes.
   1. **Request type**: Specify `URI`.
   1. In the **Set requests via form** menu:
      * In the **Requests** submenu, add the following requests:
        * `/ index`
        * `/test?param1=1&param2=2 get_test`

        The requests are marked with the `index` and `get_test` tags. The load generator will repeat them within a given load profile.
      * In the **Request headers** submenu, specify the following headers:
        * `[Host: example.myservice.ru]`
        * `[Connection: Close]`

        Please note that the `Connection: Close` header means each connection is terminated after making a request. This mode is heavier on the application and load generator. If you do not need to close connections, set `Keep-Alive`.
   1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.meta-section }}**, specify the name, description, and number of the test version. This will make the report easier to read.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.create }}**.

Afterwards, the configuration will be verified, and the agent will start loading the application being tested. You can view the report on the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_tests-list }}** tab.
