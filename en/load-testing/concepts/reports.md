# Reports

A report on the results of load testing should contain information about any issues encountered during testing. {{ load-testing-name }} provides a centralized test repository linked to the {{ yandex-cloud }} role model. When performing load testing, the load generator collects statistics, then aggregates and transmits them to load testing tool storage.

If you don't need to save reports, you can disable this feature when configuring a test.
