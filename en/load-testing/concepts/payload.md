# Payload

_Payloads_ are used by load generators for testing applications. A payload can be any relevant data that can be used to test your application. For example:

* Sets of names of test scripts that the load generator should execute.
* Sets of SQL queries for loading the database.
* HTTP requests to be sent to the server.
* Different parameters for the same request.

Load testing tool uses Phantom and Pandora load generators. Available data types depend on the formats supported by the load generator you select.

Types of payloads:

* [URI](payloads/uri.md)
* [URIPOST](payloads/uripost.md)
* [PHANTOM](payloads/phantom.md)
* [RAW](payloads/raw.md)
* [HTTP_JSON](payloads/http-json.md)
