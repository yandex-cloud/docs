# Yandex.Tank

Yandex.Tank is a tool installed on agents for managing load testing. It lets you use different [load generators](load-generator.md) (currently, Phantom and Pandora are available), manage the progress of a test, and fine-tune it. Yandex.Tank is open source: if necessary, you can audit and test the code.
