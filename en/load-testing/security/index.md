# Access management

In this section, you'll learn:

* [What resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [What roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [What roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

## What roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

The diagram shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. For example, the `editor` role includes all `viewer` role permissions. A description of each role is given under the diagram.

Active roles in the service:

* Primitive roles:
    * {% include [viewer](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/viewer.md) %}
    * {% include [editor](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/editor.md) %}
    * {% include [admin](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/admin.md) %}
* Service roles:
    * `loadtesting.viewer`: Allows viewing reports and created agents.
    * `loadtesting.editor`: Allows viewing and deleting reports, creating, deleting, and editing VMs with agents, enables the running of load tests, stopping tests, loading test data, deleting reports, and uploading output to the repository.
    * `loadtesting.admin`: At the moment, the service does not include an administrative function, so the role has the same permissions as `loadtesting.editor`.
    * `loadtesting.loadTester`: Allows viewing and deleting reports, creating, deleting, and editing VMs with agents, enables the running of load tests, stopping tests, loading test data, and deleting reports.
    * `loadtesting.generatorClient`: Allows starting VMs, running tests on agents, and uploading the output to the repository (assigned to a service account that is used to create VMs with agents).
