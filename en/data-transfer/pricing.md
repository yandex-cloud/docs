{% note info %}

Resource consumption fees are charged for transfers with the {{ dt-status-repl }} (`RUNNING`), {{ dt-status-copy }} (`SNAPSHOTTING`), or {{ dt-status-stopping }} (`STOPPING`) statuses. You can [view](operations/transfer.md#list) the transfer status in the list of transfers.

{% endnote %}

Data delivery for transfers that are at the Preview stage is free of charge. For a list of available transfers and their release stages, see [Available transfers](transfer-matrix.md).

## Examples of cost calculation {#price-example}

When calculating the cost, keep in mind that one [worker](concepts/index.md#worker) can use the following computing resources:

### One-time data copying from {{ PG }} to {{ CH }} {#copy}

The number of data rows transferred from {{ PG }} to {{ CH }} during the reporting month is 500,000,000. The copying was performed by one worker (2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM) and took 24 hours.



{% include [usd-copy](../_pricing_examples/data-transfer/usd-copy.md) %}


### Replicating data from {{ PG }} to {{ PG }} {#replication}

The number of data rows transferred from {{ PG }} to {{ PG }} during the reporting month is 50,000,000. The replication was active throughout the month, and was performed by 6 workers (12 vCPUs and 24 GB RAM).
