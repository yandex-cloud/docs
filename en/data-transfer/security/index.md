{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

## Roles required {#required-roles}

To use the service, you need the [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) `of editor` or higher for the folder where projects are created. With the `viewer` role, you can only view the list of projects and the contents of files that were downloaded.

You can always assign a role granting more permissions than the role specified. For example, assign the `admin` role instead of `editor`.

## What resources you can assign roles to {#resources}

You can assign roles for a [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud) and [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder). Cloud roles also apply to nested folders.

## What roles exist in the service {#roles-list}
