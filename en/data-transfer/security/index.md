# Access management in {{ data-transfer-name }}

In this section, you'll learn:

* [What resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [What roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [What roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

To use the service, log in to the management console with your [Yandex account](../../iam/concepts/index.md#passport) or [federated account](../../iam/concepts/index.md#saml-federation).

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

## What resources you can assign roles to {#resources}

You can assign roles for a [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud) and [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder). Cloud roles also apply to nested folders.

{% include [data-transfer-privateadmin](../../_includes/roles-data-transfer-privateadmin.md) %}

## Roles required {#required-roles}

{% if audience != "internal" %}

To use the service, you need the [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) of `editor` or higher to the folder that projects are being created in. With the `viewer` role, you can only view the list of projects and the contents of files that were downloaded.

{% else %}

To use the service, you need the role of `editor` or higher to the folder that projects are being created in. With the `viewer` role, you can only view the list of projects and the contents of files that were downloaded.

{% endif %}

You can always assign a role granting more permissions than the role specified. For example, assign the `admin` role instead of `editor`.
