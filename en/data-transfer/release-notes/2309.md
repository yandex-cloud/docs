# {{ data-transfer-name }} release notes: September 2023

1. Added support for the [{{ objstorage-name }} source](../operations/endpoint/source/object-storage.md). For more information, see the [matrix of available transfers](../transfer-matrix.md). This feature is at the Preview stage and is available upon request.

1. The following new types of [data transformers](../concepts/data-transformation.md) are now supported: 

    * [{#T}](../concepts/data-transformation.md#data-mask)
    * [{#T}](../concepts/data-transformation.md#subtable-splitting)
    * [{#T}](../concepts/data-transformation.md#replace-primary-key)
    * [{#T}](../concepts/data-transformation.md#convert-to-string)
    * [{#T}](../concepts/data-transformation.md#shard)

1. Added support for CSV and Parquet formats for data on the [{{ objstorage-name }} source](../operations/endpoint/source/object-storage.md) and Parquet for data on the [{{ objstorage-name }} target](../operations/endpoint/target/object-storage.md).

1. Added a setting for [incremental backups](../concepts/transfer-lifecycle.md#copy) that allows you to avoid potential data loss due to non-monotonically increasing `serial` or `updated_at` values.
