1. You can now perform operations with {{ KF }} and {{ ydb-short-name }} endpoints in the {{ TF }} provider.

1. Added a new [`data-transfer.auditor` role](../security/index.md##roles-list) as part of the `auditor` role for service access management.

    * Added sorting by operation type and status, operation creation and update date in the list of operations.

    * Fixed error messages and service runtime logs so that users can understand them clearly.

    * Updated the service dashboard in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.data-transfer.label_monitoring }}** tab; fixed metric and alert descriptions in the documentation.
