# Speed for copying data

The speed for copying data can reach 15 MBps. It usually takes 2-3 hours to copy a 100 GB database. The exact time depends on the target and source settings and on whether a connection is stable.

When you replicate {{ PG }} and {{ MY }} data, the bandwidth may be up to 20-30 thousand write transactions per second.
