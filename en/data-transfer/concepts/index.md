# Relationships between resources in {{ data-transfer-name }}

{{ data-transfer-full-name }} helps transfer data between DBMS, object stores, and message brokers. This way you can reduce the migration period and minimize downtime when switching to a new database.

{{ data-transfer-full-name }} is configurable via {{ yandex-cloud }} standard interfaces.

The service is suitable for creating a permanent replica of the database. The transfer of the database schema from the source to the target is automated.

## Endpoint {#endpoint}

_Endpoint_ is a configuration used to connect to the _datasource_ service or _target_ service. In addition to connection settings, the endpoint may contain information about which data will be involved in the transfer and how it should be processed during the transfer.

The following can be the data source or target:

## Transfer {#transfer}

_Transfer_ is the process of transmitting data between the source and target service. It should be in the same folder as the endpoints used.

If subnets are specified for endpoints, they must be hosted in the same {% if audience != "internal" %}[availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md){% else %}availability zone{% endif %}. Otherwise, activating the transfer with such endpoints will result in an error.

### Transfer types {#transfer-type}

The following types of transfers are available:

* _{{ dt-type-copy }}_: Moves a snapshot of the source to the target.
* _{{ dt-type-repl }}_: Continuously receives changes from the source and applies them to the target. Initial data synchronization is not performed.
* _{{ dt-type-copy-repl }}_: Transfers the current state of the source to the target and keeps it up-to-date.

For more information about the differences between transfer types, see [{#T}](./transfer-lifecycle.md).

### Compatibility of sources and targets {#connectivity-matrix}

{% include [include](../../_includes/data-transfer/connectivity-marix.md) %}

## Service specifics for sources and targets {#features}

### {{ CH }} {#clickhouse}

If replication is enabled on a {{ CH }} target, the engines for recreating tables are selected depending on the source type:

* Data transfer from row-oriented DBMS systems will use [ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replication/) and [ReplacingMergeTree]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replacingmergetree/) engines.
* Date transfers from {{ CH }} will use engines from the [ReplicatedMergeTree]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replication/) family.

### {{ GP }} {#greenplum}

Transfers to and from {{ GP }} are provided on request. Contact [support]({{ link-console-support }}) or your account manager.

### {{ MG }} {#mongodb}

By default, the service does not shard collections transferred to a sharded cluster. For more information, see [Preparing for the transfer](../operations/prepare.md#target-mg).

Transfers to {{ MG }} do not migrate indexes. When a transfer changes its status to {{ dt-status-repl }}, manually create an index for each sharded collection:

```javascript
db.<collection name>.createIndex(<index properties>)
```

For more information about the `createIndex()` function, see the [{{ MG }} documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/#mongodb-method-db.collection.createIndex).

### {{ PG }} {#postgresql}

* The service does not transfer `MATERIALIZED VIEWS`. When transfering data from one {{ PG }} cluster to another, create all the required materialized views in the target cluster after [deactivating the transfer](../operations/transfer.md#deactivate).

* The service does not transfer custom data types if the endpoint specifies a list of included or excluded tables for the source. If this is the case, please transfer your custom data types manually.

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

### {{ yds-full-name }} {#yds}

By default, a separate table is created for every partition when data is transferred from {{ yds-name }} to {{ CH }}. For all data to be entered in a single table, specify conversion rules in the [advanced endpoint settings for the source](../operations/endpoint/source/data-streams.md#additional-settings).

{% endif %}

## Change data capture {#cdc}

CDC ([change data capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture)) is a process of tracking changes in a database and delivering them to consumers in near real-time. CDC can be used to:

* Create applications that respond to data changes in real time.
* Deliver data from a centralized storage to microservices.
* Collect and deliver data from a production environment to internal data storages for processing and analysis.

In {{ yandex-cloud }}, one way CDC can be implemented is with a transfer from the database to the message broker. All database updates are tracked by the transfer and sent to the message broker, and consumers are connected to the broker and read the incoming messages.

{{ data-transfer-name }} supports CDC for transfers from {{ PG }}, {{ MG }}, and {{ MY }} databases to {{ KF }} and {{ yds-full-name }}^1^. Data is sent to the target in [Debezium](https://debezium.io/) format.
