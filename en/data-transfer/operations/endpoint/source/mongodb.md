# Transferring data from a {{ MG }}/{{ SD }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) source endpoint


{{ data-transfer-full-name }} enables you to migrate data from a {{ MG }} database and implement various data transfer, processing, and transformation scenarios. To implement a transfer:

1. [Explore possible data transfer scenarios](#scenarios).
1. [Prepare the {{ MG }}](#prepare) database for the transfer.
1. [Set up a source endpoint](#endpoint-settings) in {{ data-transfer-full-name }}.
1. [Set up one of the supported data targets](#supported-targets).
1. [Create](../../transfer.md#create) a transfer and [start](../../transfer.md#activate) it.
1. [Perform the required operations with the database](#db-actions) and [see how the transfer is going](../../monitoring.md).
1. In case of any issues, [use ready-made solutions](#troubleshooting) to resolve them.

## Scenarios for transferring data from {{ MG }}/{{ SD }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) {#scenarios}

1. {% include [migration](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/scenario-captions/migration.md) %}

    * [Migrating a {{ MG }} cluster](../../../tutorials/storedoc.md)
    * [Migrating a {{ SD }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) cluster from 4.4 to 6.0](../../../tutorials/storedoc-versions.md)

1. {% include [storage](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/scenario-captions/storage.md) %}

For a detailed description of possible {{ data-transfer-full-name }} scenarios, see [Tutorials](../../../tutorials/index.md).

## Preparing the source database {#prepare}

{% include [prepare db](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/endpoints/sources/mongodb-prepare.md) %}

## Configuring a {{ MG }}/{{ SD }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) source endpoint {#endpoint-settings}

{% include [MongodDB Version](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/notes/mongodb-version.md) %}

When [creating](../index.md#create) or [updating](../index.md#update) an endpoint, you can define:

* [{{ mmg-full-name }} cluster](#managed-service) connection or [custom installation](#on-premise) settings, including those based on {{ compute-full-name }} VMs. These are required parameters.
* [Additional parameters](#additional-settings).

### {{ mmg-name }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) cluster {#managed-service}


{% note warning %}

To create or edit an endpoint of a managed database, you will need the [`{{ roles.mmg.viewer }}`](../../../../storedoc/security/index.md#mmg-viewer) role or the primitive [`viewer`](../../../../iam/roles-reference.md#viewer) role for the folder the cluster of this managed database resides in.

{% endnote %}


Connection to the database with the cluster specified in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

    * {% include [excluded-collections](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/fields/mongodb/ui/excluded-collections.md) %}

    Included and excluded collection names must meet the ID naming rules in {{ MG }}. Escaping double quotes is not required.

{% endlist %}

If a source workload is high (over 10,000 write transactions per second), we recommend that you select these settings to have no more than ten different databases at each endpoint. This will help avoid database connection errors while the transfer is ongoing.

{% note info %}

* If you use several endpoints, you need to create a separate transfer for each one.
* Transferring of `Time Series` collections is not supported, so you should exclude such collections.

{% endnote %}


## Configuring the data target {#supported-targets}

Configure one of the supported data targets:

* [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../target/object-storage.md)
* [{{ mmg-name }} (Managed Service for MongoDB)](../target/mongodb.md).

For a complete list of supported sources and targets in {{ data-transfer-full-name }}, see [Available transfers](../../../transfer-matrix.md).

After configuring the data source and target, [create and start the transfer](../../transfer.md#create).

## Operations with the database during transfer {#db-actions}

{% include [work with db](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/endpoints/sources/mongo-work-with-db.md) %}

## Troubleshooting data transfer issues {#troubleshooting}

Known issues when using a {{ MG }} endpoint:
