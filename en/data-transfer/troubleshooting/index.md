# Troubleshooting

This section describes typical problems that may arise during [transfer](../concepts/index.md#transfer) [activation](../operations/transfer.md#activate) or operation, and the relevant resolution methods depending on the type of source/target or network-related ones:

* [{#T}](mongodb.md);
* [{#T}](mysql.md);
* [{#T}](postgresql.md);
* [{#T}](ydb.md);
* [{#T}](network.md).

Key features about preparing sources and targets for a transfer are described in the [relevant section](../operations/prepare.md).

Limitations on sources and targets while a transfer is running are described in [{#T}](../operations/db-actions.md).
