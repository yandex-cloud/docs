# Troubleshooting

This section describes typical problems that may arise during [transfers](../concepts/index.md#transfer) or [activation](../operations/transfer.md#activate), and the relevant resolution methods depending on the source or target type:

* [{#T}](mongodb.md);
* [{#T}](mysql.md);
* [{#T}](postgresql.md);
* [{#T}](ydb.md).

Key features about preparing sources and targets for transfer are described in the [relevant section](../operations/prepare.md).

Limitations on source and target access while a transfer is running are described in [{#T}](../operations/db-actions.md).
