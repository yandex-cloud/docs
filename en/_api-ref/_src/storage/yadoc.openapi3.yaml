        recovered.

        For the bucket with versioning enabled ([Bucket.versioning](/docs/storage/api-ref/Bucket#representation) is `VERSIONING_ENABLED`), the current version of the
        object (if it exists and is not a delete marker) is retained as a non-current version, and a delete marker becomes
        the current version of the object.

         - VERSIONING_DISABLED: The bucket is unversioned, i.e. versioning has never been enabled for the bucket, including at its creation.
        Objects that are stored in the bucket have a version ID of `null`.

        To enable versioning, change status to `VERSIONING_ENABLED` via a [update](/docs/storage/api-ref/Bucket/update) request. Note that this
        action is irreversible, and a bucket with versioning enabled can never return to `VERSIONING_DISABLED` state.
         - VERSIONING_ENABLED: Bucket versioning is enabled, i.e. all new objects are versioned and given a unique version ID, and objects that
        already existed at the time versioning was enabled will be versioned and given a unique version ID when modified
        by future requests.

        To suspend versioning, change status to `VERSIONING_SUSPENDED` via a [update](/docs/storage/api-ref/Bucket/update) request. You cannot
        disable versioning altogether for a bucket that already had it enabled; objects that had version IDs will keep
        them.
         - VERSIONING_SUSPENDED: Bucket versioning is suspended, i.e. new objects are not versioned, but objects that already existed at the time
        versioning was suspended are still versioned and keep their version IDs.

        To resume versioning, change status to `VERSIONING_ENABLED` via a [update](/docs/storage/api-ref/Bucket/update) request.
