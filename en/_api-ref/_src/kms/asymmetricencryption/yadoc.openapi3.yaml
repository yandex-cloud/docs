         - ACTIVE: The key is active and can be used for encryption and decryption or signature and verification.
        Can be set to INACTIVE using the [AsymmetricKeyService.Update] method.
         - INACTIVE: The key is inactive and unusable.
        Can be set to ACTIVE using the [AsymmetricKeyService.Update] method.
      type: string
