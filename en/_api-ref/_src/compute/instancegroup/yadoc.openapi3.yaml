        If the field is specified in `` updateMask `` and no value for that field was sent in the request,

              {instance_group.labels.some_label_key}
              {instance.labels.another_label_key}
            These placeholders will be substituted for each created instance anywhere in the value text.
            In the rare case the value requires to contain this placeholder explicitly,
            it must be escaped with double brackets, in example {instance.index}.

            For example, you may use the metadata in order to provide your public SSH key to the instance.
