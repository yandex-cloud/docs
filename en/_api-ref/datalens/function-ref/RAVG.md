# RAVG (window)



#### Syntax {#syntax}


```
RAVG( value [ , direction ] [ TOTAL | WITHIN ... | AMONG ... ] [ ORDER BY ... ] [ BEFORE FILTER BY ... ] )
```

#### Description {#description}
Returns the average of all values in a growing (or shrinking) window defined by the sort order and the value of `direction`:

| `direction`   | Window                                                 |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| `"asc"`       | Starts from the first row and ends at the current row. |
| `"desc"`      | Starts from the current row and ends at the last row.  |

By default `"asc"` is used.


Window functions with a similar behavior: [RSUM](RSUM.md), [RCOUNT](RCOUNT.md), [RMIN](RMIN.md), [RMAX](RMAX.md).

See also [AVG](AVG.md), [MAVG](MAVG.md).

**Argument types:**
- `value` — `Number`
- `direction` — `String`


**Return type**: `Number (whole)`

{% note info %}

Only constant values are accepted for arguments (`direction`).

{% note warning %}

The sorting order is based on the fields listed in the chart's sorting section and in the function's `ORDER BY` clause. First, `ORDER BY` fields are used, and then they are complemented by the fields from the chart.
