# Method listInstances
Lists instances for the specified instance group.
 

 
## HTTP request {#https-request}
```
GET https://compute.api.cloud.yandex.net/compute/v1/instanceGroups/{instanceGroupId}/instances
```
 
## Path parameters {#path_params}
 
Parameter | Description
--- | ---
instanceGroupId | Required. ID of the InstanceGroup resource to list instances for. To get the instance group ID, use a [list](/docs/compute/api-ref/InstanceGroup/list) request.  The maximum string length in characters is 50.
 
## Query parameters {#query_params}
 
Parameter | Description
--- | ---
pageSize | The maximum number of results per page to return. If the number of available results is larger than [pageSize](/docs/compute/api-ref/InstanceGroup/listInstances#query_params), the service returns a [nextPageToken](/docs/compute/api-ref/InstanceGroup/listInstances#responses) that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.  The maximum value is 1000.
pageToken | Page token. To get the next page of results, set [pageToken](/docs/compute/api-ref/InstanceGroup/listInstances#query_params) to the [nextPageToken](/docs/compute/api-ref/InstanceGroup/listInstances#responses) returned by a previous list request.  The maximum string length in characters is 100.
filter | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Currently you can use filtering only on the [InstanceGroup.name](/docs/compute/api-ref/InstanceGroup#representation) field.  The maximum string length in characters is 1000.
 
## Response {#responses}
**HTTP Code: 200 - OK**
