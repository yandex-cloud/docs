# Personal forms in {{ forms-full-name }}

Personal forms in {{ forms-full-name }} can be created by users with Yandex accounts:

- To createÂ a personal form go to the [{{ link-forms-admin }}]({{ link-forms-admin }}) page. For more information, see [{#T}](quick-guide.md).

The users of personal forms can't use [features for business](forms-for-org.md#business-features), such as integration with [{{ tracker-name }}](create-task.md) and [{{ wiki-name }}](send-wiki.md).

Only the owner of a personal form can edit it and view responses.
