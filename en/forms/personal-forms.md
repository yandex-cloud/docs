# Personal forms in {{ forms-full-name }}

Personal forms in {{ forms-full-name }} can be created by users who have Yandex accounts:

To create a personal form, go to [{{ link-forms-admin }}]({{ link-forms-admin }}). To learn more, go to [{#T}](quick-guide.md).

{% if audience == "external" %}

{% if locale == "ru" %}

You can also create a form using a [Yandex Zen widget](forms-lite.md).

{% endif %}

{% endif %}

Users of personal forms can't use [business features](forms-for-org.md#business-features), such as integration with [{{ tracker-name }}](create-task.md) and [{{ wiki-name }}](send-wiki.md).

Only the owner can edit and view responses to personal forms.

To learn more about {{ forms-full-name }} features, go to [{#T}](overview.md).
