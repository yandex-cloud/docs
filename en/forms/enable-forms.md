# Enable {{ forms-full-name }} for business

Users of organizations registered on the {{ yandex-cloud }} platform can use the {{ forms-full-name }} service in their work: create forms for conducting surveys and tests and accept applications and requests from clients. To learn more about the features of {{ forms-full-name }} for business, go to [{#T}](forms-for-org.md).

{{ forms-full-name }} can be connected to an existing organization, or you can create a new organization. You can learn more about managing organizations in the [{{ org-full-name }} documentation](../organization/).

1. Go to the business form management page [{{ link-forms-b2b }}]({{ link-forms-b2b }}).

1. [Log in to the account](login.md) you use for work in your organization.

1. If your account is registered in several organizations, select the organization where you want to use {{ forms-full-name }}. Then click **Log in**.

## Create a new organization {#new-org}

If you don't have an organization in {{ org-full-name }}, a new organization will be automatically created for you when you first log in to {{ forms-full-name }} for business.

An organization can only be created for users who have a Yandex account.
