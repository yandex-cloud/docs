# Enable {{ forms-full-name }} for business

Users of organizations registered on {{ yandex-cloud }} can use {{ forms-full-name }} in their work: they can create forms for conducting surveys and tests and accept applications and requests from clients. For more information about features {{ forms-full-name }} for business, see [{#T}](forms-for-org.md).

You can enable {{ forms-full-name }} for an existing organization or create a new one. Read more about managing organizations in the [{{ org-full-name }} documentation](../organization/).

## Activate {{ forms-full-name }} in the existing organization {#current-org}

If you already have an organization in {{ org-full-name }}, {{ forms-full-name }} for business will automatically activate when any user of that organization logs in for the first time:

1. Go to the page for managing forms for business: [{{ link-forms-b2b }}]({{ link-forms-b2b }}).

1. [Log in](login.md) to the account you use to work in organization.

1. If your account is registered in several organizations, select the organization where you want to use {{ forms-full-name }}. Then click **Log in**.

## Create a new organization {#new-org}

If you haven't registered an organization in {{ org-full-name }} yet, one will be created automatically the first time you log in to the {{ forms-full-name }}.

{% note warning %}

An organization can only be created for users who have a Yandex account.

{% endnote %}

1. Log in to your [Yandex account]({{ link-passport }}). If you don't have an account, [create]({{ support-passport-create }}) one.

1. Go to the page for managing forms for business: [{{ link-forms-b2b }}]({{ link-forms-b2b }}).

1. Accept the {{ yandex-cloud }} terms of use and tap **Log in**.

   Your organization is automatically created and {{ forms-full-name }} is activated.

1. In {{ org-full-name }}, add users to your organization or set up an identity federation so that your employees can use their work accounts to access {{ yandex-cloud }} services.
