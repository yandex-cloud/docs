* [Access to forms for user groups](#access-teams)

## Access to forms for user groups {#access-teams}

It is now easier to grant access to a form or a group of forms: if access is required for a group of users from an organization, you can grant it to this specific group instead of assigning it manually to each user in the group. This way, you can configure access permissions for user groups from {{ ya-360 }} and {{ org-full-name }} organizations.
