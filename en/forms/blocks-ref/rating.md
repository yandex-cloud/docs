# Rate on a scale

In this block, the user can evaluate an item or event on a given scale. For example, if you want to collect feedback about an event, you can ask users to rate it on a five-point scale for categories like how well it was organized, topics that were presented, and how the host or moderator did their job.

Enter your prompt. For example, ask the user to rate something.

{% include [question](../../_includes/forms/question.md) %}

### Criteria {#param-criterion}

- To add a criterion, select the **Add option** field and enter a name.

- To add a response option, select **Add option** and enter the response text.

- To format the text of the response, use [Markdown](../appearance.md#section_pzm_m1j_j3b).
