# Rate on a scale

In this block, the user can evaluate an item or event on a given scale. For example, if you want to collect feedback about an event, you can ask users to rate it on a five-point scale for categories like how well it was organized, topics that were presented, and how the host or moderator did their job.

### Question {#param-question}

Enter your prompt. For example, ask the user to rate something.

{% include [question](../../_includes/forms/question.md) %}

### Criteria {#param-criterion}

In the **Criteria** section, set the criteria for evaluating items or list multiple items to evaluate. For example, you can set the following criteria for evaluating an event: how well it was organized, the topics presented, and how the host or moderator did their job.

- To add a criterion, select the **Add option** field and enter a name.

- To move a criterion to a different position in the list, drag it to the ![](../../_assets/forms/drag-answer.png) icon.

### Responses {#param-answers}

- To add a response option, select **Add option** and enter the response text.

- To format the text of the response, use [Markdown](../appearance.md#section_pzm_m1j_j3b).
