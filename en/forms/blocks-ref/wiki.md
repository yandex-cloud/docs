# {{ wiki-name }}

{% if audience == "external" %}

{% note info %}

This block is only available for [{{ forms-full-name }} for business](../forms-for-org.md) users.

{% endnote %}

{% endif %}

In this block, the user can enter response options that are loaded from a [{{ wiki-name }} dynamic table](../../wiki/create-grid.md). When they type, hints with suggested responses appear in the field. Responses that aren't in the table aren't accepted.

If multiple {{ wiki-name }} blocks are used in the form, you can [configure response filtering](#filter). In this case, the set of possible responses in one {{ wiki-name }} block changes depending on the response the user selected in another block.

## Block settings {#sec_settings}

### Prompt

Enter the field name or the prompt.

{% include [question](../../_includes/forms/question.md) %}

{% include [id-required-hidden](../../_includes/forms/id-required-hidden.md) %}

### Link to the table of responses

In **Settings**, insert an absolute or relative link to the [dynamic table of response options](#sec_table). Examples:

`{{ link-wiki }}users/<user-name>/<page-name>`


`/users/<user-name>/<page-name>`

### Filter responses {#filter}

You can use this option to filter response options in the {{ wiki-name }} block: load different rows from the dynamic table depending on the response selected in a different {{ wiki-name }} block. To do this, add at least two {{ wiki-name }} blocks to the form:

* Parent block.

* A block with response options that are filtered depending on the response that the user selected in the parent block.

To filter response options:

1. Add a parent {{ wiki-name }} block to the form or select an existing block as the parent.

1. Create a [table of responses with an additional column for filtering](#sec_filter).

1. Add a block with filtering to the form and put a link to the created table in **Settings**.

1. Turn on **Filter responses**.

1. In the **Select a question to filter** list, specify the {{ wiki-name }} block with the parent table.

{% include [validate-blockrefs](../../_includes/forms/validate-blockrefs.md) %}

{% endif %}

## Create a table of responses {#sec_table}

The table of responses for the {{ wiki-name }} block must use a special format. To create the table:

1. In [{{ wiki-full-name }}]({{ link-wiki }}), create [a dynamic table](../../wiki/create-grid.md).

1. Add a column named `name`.

   If there are other columns in the table, they won't affect the response options in the {{ wiki-name }} block.

1. Add multiple rows to the table. In cells in the `name` column, enter response options that must be available in the {{ wiki-name }} block.

{% if audience == "external" %}

1. Make sure the service account `yndx-wiki-cnct-robot@` has [access to the table](../../wiki/page-management/access-setup.md). This account also has access to the table if **Available to all employees** mode is on.

{% else %}

1. Make sure the robot `robot-forms@` has [access to the table](../../wiki/page-management/access-setup.md). The robot also has access to the table if the **Available to all employees** mode is on.

{% endif %}

1. Put a link to the table in the {{ wiki-name }} block settings.

## Create a table with response filtering {#sec_filter}

To create a table with response filtering:

1. In [{{ wiki-full-name }}]({{ link-wiki }}), create [a dynamic table](../../wiki/create-grid.md).

1. Add columns named `name` and ` parent` to the table.

   If there are other columns in the table, they won't affect the response options in the {{ wiki-name }} block or the filtering.

1. Add multiple rows to the table. In cells in the `name` column, enter response options that must be available in the {{ wiki-name }} block.

1. Link each response option to a row in the parent table. That's the table specified in the parent {{ wiki-name }} block settings. To do so, go to the `parent` column and specify the row number in the parent table that should load the response in the {{ wiki-name }} block with filtering.

   For example, if the user selects a response from row number `1` in the parent block, response options that have `1` specified in the `parent` column are available in the block with filtering.

{% endif %}

1. Put a link to the table in the {{ wiki-name }} block settings and [turn on response filtering](#dlentry_filter).
