# Payment

This block lets users transfer money to a wallet in the YooMoney payment system (previously, Yandex.Money). For example, as payment for attending an event.

From the **Payment** block, the user is redirected to the company's website [Ð®Money]({{ link-yoomoney }}) to complete the payment. {{ forms-full-name }} only register the user's transition to the payment page. You can get information about payments and fees from YooMoney.

{% note warning %}

You can only use the **Payment** block to accept payments to a registered or identified wallet belonging to an individual. The transfer fee is deducted from the recipient.
