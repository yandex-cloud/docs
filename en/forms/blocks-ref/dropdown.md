Enter the list title or the prompt you want to use.

{% include [question](../../_includes/forms/question.md) %}

{% include [param-answer](../../_includes/forms/param-answer.md) %}

{% include [id-required-hidden](../../_includes/forms/id-required-hidden.md) %}

### Automatically insert the first response option {#first}

Turn on this option to insert the first response in the list by default. For example, do this if you think that this option fits most users.

Sorting responses affects which response is automatically inserted.

### Filter responses when typing text in the field {#filter}

Turn on this option so the user can type in the field with the list. In this case, only the response options that match the entered text are displayed in the list.
