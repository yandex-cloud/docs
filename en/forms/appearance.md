# Customizing the appearance of form

## Customize the theme {#section_sgz_my3_j3b}

To make your form unique and appealing, customize the appearance of the text and buttons or add a background image:

1. Select the form and open the **Theme** tab.

1. Pick one of the available themes or create your own using the **Create theme** button:

   1. Set a background for the form workspace: choose a fill color or an image from the gallery, or upload your own background. You can set background transparency, corner rounding, and text indentation. To make the background visible behind the response fields, set field transparency.

   1. Select the fonts and text color. Try to choose a color that makes the text easy to read against your selected background.

   1. Adjust the color, shape, and position of the buttons.

   1. Select the backdrop: the background around the form workspace. To do so, turn on **Add backdrop**, select a fill color, pick an image from the gallery, or upload your own background. The backdrop is visible if you [open the form via a link](publish.md#section_link).

   1. Click **Save**. To change you theme, hover over the trigger and click ![](../_assets/forms/settings.png).

1. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

If the form is already published, its design changes.


## Button names and messages {#sec_submit}

You can set form button names and the message that the user sees after submitting their response:

1. Select a form and go to **Settings** → **Text and submit logic**.

1. Change the button names under **Form submission button**, **Next page button**, or **Previous page button**.

1. Edit the title and text of your message under **Event after submit**.

1. Click **Save**.


## Formatting text {#section_pzm_m1j_j3b}

To add formatting elements like headers, lists, links, and italics to the text, use [Markdown]({{ link-wikipedia-markdown }}). You can format using Markdown:

- Prompts and comments.

- The message about sending the form.

{% note info %}

To format text, Markdown uses `*`, `-`, `>`, and some other characters. If these characters are at the beginning of a line, they change the appearance of the text, but aren't displayed. To display them, add a backslash (`\*`) before these characters.

{% endnote %}


## Sample markup {#markdown-example}

**Markup:**

```
## This is a heading

This is the text of a prompt. You can use *italics* or **bold** in it.

### This is a second-level heading

The text can be arranged as a list:
1. List items.*
1. Lists can be nested:
    * Nested list item.
    * Nested list item.

Example [links](https://yandex.ru).

\* A note for the first item.
```

**Result:**

## Showing previous user responses {#refilling}

You can set up the form to show the user's previous responses so that the user can edit them.

Enable this setting if you want to track changes in user responses: both the old and new versions will be stored. You can see all the responses on the [response page](./answers.md).

{% note warning %}

Previous responses are only shown to the user if they fill out the form using the same [Yandex account]({{ link-passport }}).

{% endnote %}

To show user responses on the form page:

1. Select the form and open the **Settings** → **Additional** tab.

1. Under **Advanced**, enable the option **Show previous user responses in the form**.

1. Click **Save**.
