# Integration with other services

Integrate your form with other services to use their features for processing user responses and other form data. You can:

{% if audience == "external" and locale == "ru" %}

- [Publish the form on Yandex Zen.](forms-lite.md)

{% endif %}

- [Set up actions](#add-integration) that are performed automatically when the user fills out the form:

    - [Send notifications by email.](send-mail.md)

    - [Create tasks in {{ tracker-name }}](create-task.md) and add form data to them.

    - [Add user responses to {{ wiki-name }}.](send-wiki.md)

    - [Send HTTP requests to the API.](send-request.md)

- [Connect a Yandex&#160;Metrica](metrica.md) tag and gather statistics on form traffic.

You can set up multiple automated actions for each form and [set conditions for performing those actions](#section_xlw_rjc_tbb) depending on user responses to the prompts.

{% if audience == "external" %}

{% note info %}

Integration with {{ wiki-name }} and {{ tracker-name }} services is only available to [{{ forms-full-name }} for business](forms-for-org.md) users.

{% endnote %}

{% endif %}

## Add actions {#add-integration}

To integrate the form with other services, you can configure one or more actions to be performed automatically when the user submits a completed form. To do this:

1. Select a form and go to **Integration**.

1. Add a new group of actions or use an existing one. You can add multiple actions to a group and set common conditions for performing them.

    {% note info %}

    By default, a group with one action — sending an email — is set up for all forms. This group is enabled, and you can disable or delete it or add your own actions to it.

    {% endnote %}

    - To create a new group, click {% if audience == "external" %}**Add notification group**{% else %}**Add group of actions**{% endif %} at the bottom of the page.

    - To create a group of actions based on an existing one, click ![](../_assets/forms/context-menu.png) in the upper-right corner and select **Copy group of actions**. Then edit the copy.

    - To enable or disable a group of actions, use the ![](../_assets/forms/enabled-switch-blue.png) toggle in the upper-right corner.

    - To delete a group of actions, click ![](../_assets/forms/context-menu.png) in the upper-right corner and select **Delete group of actions**.

1. If necessary, [set up action conditions for the group](#section_xlw_rjc_tbb).
To configure multiple actions to be performed under different conditions, add multiple groups.

1. To add an action to a group, click a button at the bottom of the group:

    - To [send a notification by email](send-mail.md), click ![](../_assets/forms/mail-notification-new.png) **Mail**.

    - To [create a task in {{ tracker-name }}](create-task.md), click ![](../_assets/forms/tracker-notification-new.png) **{{ tracker-short-name }}**.

    - To [add a response to a Wiki page](send-wiki.md), click ![](../_assets/forms/wiki-notification-new.png) **{{ wiki-name }}**.

    - To [send an HTTP request](send-request.md), click ![](../_assets/forms/api-notification.png) **API** and select the request type.

    {% if audience == "external" %}

    {% note info %}

    Integration with {{ wiki-name }} and {{ tracker-name }} services is only available to [{{ forms-full-name }} for business](forms-for-org.md) users.

    {% endnote %}

    {% endif %}

1. Configure the action and click **Save**.

1. To disable an action, use the ![](../_assets/forms/enabled-switch-blue.png) toggle in the upper-right corner.

1. To delete an action, click the ![](../_assets/forms/context-menu.png) icon and select **Delete**.

{% if audience == "internal" %}To return to setting up prompts, click the **To constructor** link at the top of the page.{% endif %}

## Set conditions {#section_xlw_rjc_tbb}

You can set conditions for integrating your form with other services. Then the actions (sending notifications or creating tasks) will only be performed if the user gives certain responses to the prompts. To set up conditions for performing actions:

1. Select a form and click **Integration** at the top of the page.

1. Select a group of actions and enable the {% if audience == "external" %}**Performing actions on condition**{% else %}**Perform actions on condition**{% endif %} option.

1. To set up an action that is performed in accordance with the responses to the form prompts:

    1. Specify a prompt that requires a certain response as a condition for the action.

    1. Select a relational operator: **equal** or **not equal**.

    1. Select or enter a response that the user's response needs to match.
        
        ![](../_assets/forms/integration-condition-new.png)

        - If you want the actions to be triggered by any response (if the form field is filled in), select the relational operator **not equal** in the condition and leave the response field empty.

        - If you want the actions to be triggered when a user doesn't respond (if the form field isn't filled in), select the relational operator **equal** in the condition and leave the response field empty.
   
    For example, you can have an email sent to a user if they fill in the **Email** field in the form.
        ![](../_assets/forms/condition-empty-new.png)

{% if audience == "internal" %}

1. To have an action performed based on what interface language the user has selected:

   1. In the **If the value of** field, select **Language**.

   1. Select a relational operator: **equal** or **not equal**.

   1. Select a language that the user's response needs to match.

{% endif %}

1. To add multiple conditions, click **Add condition** and set a logical operator.

    - If you put the **and** logical operator between two conditions, they must both be met. If you use the **or** operator, at least one condition must be met.

    - If you add multiple conditions with different operators, the conditions are checked from top to bottom. The **and** operator doesn't take priority over the **or** operator.

   {% note info %}

   To make sure results are predictable when checking a group of conditions, we recommend using just one operator type: all conditions with **and** or all conditions with **or**.

   {% endnote %}

1. Click **Save conditions**.

To add multiple actions with different conditions, click **Add group of actions** at the bottom of the page and set up conditions and [actions](#add-integration) for the new group.

## Integration errors {#status}

If integration failed when getting responses to the form and the [set actions](#add-integration) couldn't be performed, an error message appears on the action settings card.

1. Check action settings and make changes if necessary.

1. To view the list of responses for which the action failed, click **Show**.

1. To try performing the actions again, select the lines with the **Error** status and click **Restart**.

### Configure notifications about integration errors {#error-notification}

To have notifications about integration issues sent by email:

1. Select the form and go to **Settings** → **Additional**.

1. In the **Notify about integration errors** field, list the users to receive the notifications.
