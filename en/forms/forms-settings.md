Forms can be copied [from the internal admin panel to the external admin panel](new-form.md#instance) and back using the export and import functions.

Let's say you created a feedback form for a new service that's being tested by Yandex employees. After the service is released, you need to create the same feedback form for external users.

1. Click **Go to the old version** on the top panel.

1. In the old version of the admin panel, click **Export form** in the upper-right corner of the page.

1. Configure the options for saving the form settings and click **Export**.

1. Specify where to save the JSON file to.

### Step 2. Import form

1. Open the admin panel you want to import the form to: [internal]({{ link-forms-admin-ya }}) or [external]({{ link-forms-ext-ya }}).

1. Click **Go to the old version** on the top panel.

1. In the old version of the admin panel, click **Import** in the upper-right corner of the main page.

1. Select the JSON file you saved and click **Import**.

The form will appear in the list, and you can continue working with it.
