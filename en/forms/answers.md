# Get responses

You can view responses in the {{ forms-full-name }} interface, download them as a file, or save them to Yandex.Disk.

       * To make the list of responses include data from users who completed the form and additional response parameters, click **Show additional parameters**.

       * If you choose the XLSX file format, the table with responses opens in the Yandex.Disk online editor.
       * If you select the CSV or JSON format, a folder on Yandex.Disk containing the saved file opens.
       * If new tabs are blocked from opening in your browser, a link to the saved file appears next to the **Upload to Yandex.Disk** button.
       * The attached files will be available in the `Yandex.Forms/<Form ID>/Files` folder on Yandex.Disk and via the [link from the list of responses](#files).

       You can access the responses saved on Yandex.Disk from any device, and you can share them with other users. To learn more about using Yandex.Disk, go to [Help]({{ support-disk-main }}).

       {% endcut %}

    {% if audience == "internal" %}
    
    {% note warning %}

    If you haven't linked your personal login to the Staff and haven't enabled two-factor authentication, the file will be downloaded to your computer.
        
    {% endnote %}
    
    {% endif %}

## View responses individually {#answer-in-detail}

   {% endnote %}
