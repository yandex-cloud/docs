# Configuring conditions for submitting a response

You can configure requirements in a form for allowing users to submit a response, or add a CAPTCHA to prevent automated responses.

1. Select or enter a response that the user's response needs to match.

1. At the bottom of the page, click **Save**.

1. Select the form and open the **Settings** → **Additional** tab.

1. Turn on the **Add captcha before submitting form** option.

1. Click **Save**.
