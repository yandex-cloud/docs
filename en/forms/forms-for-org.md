   If a company has a system for user and access management (such as Active Directory or Google Workspace), employees can use their corporate accounts to log in to the organization in {{ yandex-cloud }} and get access to forms using a Single Sign-On (SSO) system. To do this, the administrator of the organization needs to set up an identity federation.
