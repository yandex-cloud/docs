# Send message

You can set up integration of your form with Yandex.Mail so that a notification is sent automatically when the user fills out the form.

## Configure notifications {#setup}

1. Select a form and go to **Integration**.

1. Select a [group of actions](notifications.md#add-integration) for which you want emails sent and click ![](../_assets/forms/mail-notification-button.png) at the bottom of the group.

1. In the **Send mail** block, fill out the fields:

    - **To**: The email address the notification is sent to. You can list multiple addresses separated by commas or specify a variable.

        - To send a notification to the form owner's email, select the **Form owner email** variable.

        - To send a notification to the {% if audience == "external" %}Yandex{% endif %} account email the user was logged under when filling out the form, select the **Email** variable.

        - To send a notification to the address the user gave in response to a prompt, add a **Response to prompt** variable and select the <q>Email</q> prompt type.

    {% if audience == "internal" %}

    - **From**: The email address the notification is sent from. Only use emails on allowed domains:

        - `market.yandex.ru`

        - `contest.yandex.ru`

        - `o.yandex.ru`

        - `support.yandex.ru`

        - `yandex-team.ru`

        - `forms.yandex.ru`

        If the field uses the [variable](vars.md), its content must also be an email address with a permitted domain. If the field is not filled in, the email will be sent from the default address. If you used an address with a domain not included in the permitted list, the notification won't be sent.

    {% endif %}

    - **Sender**: The sender name you want the recipient to see.

    - **Send response to**: The email the recipient can send responses to. If you don't specify the return email address, your respondents won't be able to reach you by email.

    - **Subject**: The subject of your email.

    - **Text**: The text of your email.

    {% if audience == "internal" %}
    - If necessary, add headers to the message. Specify a name and value for each header.

    {% endif %}

    You can insert a response to a prompt or other form data in any field:

    - Select a field and click **Variables** on the right.

    - Select a [variable](vars.md) from the list that you want to add. For example, you can add a variable to address the user by their name or to include their [test results](tests.md) in the email.

    {% if audience == "draft" %} ![](../_assets/forms/mail-var-example.png) {% endif %}

1. If necessary, attach a file to the email.

1. To display a message informing users that an email was sent after they fill out the form, turn on the **Show result to user** option under the name of the action.

1. Click **Save**.

To send multiple email notifications at the same time, add them using the ![](../_assets/forms/mail-notification-button.png) button at the bottom of the group of actions.

If you want notifications to only be sent to users who gave certain responses, [set your conditions](notifications.md#section_xlw_rjc_tbb).

{% if audience == "draft" %} > Example of a notification for a job application form. After the form is filled out, responses to the prompts are sent to the email of the HR department.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If you set up email notifications but aren't getting emails when your form is filled out, check your spam folder and see if there are errors when sending emails.

### Check your spam folder

If you aren't receiving email notifications, check your <q>Spam</q> folder. If emails from {{ forms-full-name }} were sent to the spam folder, mark them as <q>Not spam</q>.

If you use your own mail server, <q>whitelist</q> the `form_id@forms-mailer.yaconnect.com` sender address.

### Check the text of the email

The mail server can block an email if its text is missing or looks like spam. Add or edit the text of the email.

### Check for errors when sending emails

1. Open the form with notification issues and go to the **Integration** tab.

1. Check for an error message in your notification settings.

   {% if audience == "draft" %} ![](../_assets/forms/mail-error.png) {% endif %}

1. If there's an error message:

    1. [Take a screenshot]({{ support-troubleshooting-screen }}).

    1. [Contact {{ forms-full-name }}](feedback.md) support and attach a screenshot of the error to your message.

### If there are no spam notifications or error messages

If you have no notifications in the <q>Spam</q> folder or errors in the **Integration** tab, the email may be blocked by the recipient's mail server. To find out why the email is blocked:

1. Open the form with notification issues and go to the **Integration** tab.

1. In the notification settings, go to the **Send response to** field and enter your personal or work email.

1. The next time the mail server blocks a notification from the form, an error message will be sent to the email that you specified. Copy the text of the message.

1. [Contact {{ forms-full-name }}](feedback.md) support and add the error message that you received to your request.
