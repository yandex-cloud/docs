# Send an email

You can integrate your form with Yandex Mail so that a notification is sent automatically when the user fills out the form.

## Configuring notifications {#setup}

1. Select the form and open the **Integration** tab.

1. Select a [group of actions](notifications.md#add-integration) for which you want to set up sending emails and click ![](../_assets/forms/mail-notification-new.png) **Email** at the bottom of the group.

1. Under action settings, fill in the following fields:

   - **To**: The email address the notification is sent to. You can list multiple addresses separated by commas, or set a variable.

      - To send a notification to the form creator's email, {% if audience == "internal" %}click ![](../_assets/forms/add-var.png) and{% endif %} select the **Form creator's email** variable.

      - To send a notification to the{% if audience == "external" %} Yandex email account{% endif %} the user was logged in to when filling out the form, select the **Email** variable. {% if audience == "external" %} Is only available to [{{ forms-full-name }} for business](forms-for-org.md) users.{% endif %}

      - To send a notification to the address the user gave in response to a prompt, add the **Response to prompt** variable and select the <q>Email</q> prompt type.


   {% if audience == "internal" %}

   - **From**: The email address the notification is to be sent from. Be sure to only specify email addresses on the permitted domains:

      - `market.yandex.ru`.

      - `contest.yandex.ru`.

      - `o.yandex.ru`.

      - `support.yandex.ru`.

      - `yandex-team.ru`.

      - `forms.yandex.ru`.

      If the field value is a [variable](vars.md), it should also contain an email address on one of the permitted domains. If the field is empty, an email is sent from the default email address. If you specify an email address on a domain that is not on the list of permitted ones, no notification is sent.

   {% endif %}

   - **Sender**: The sender name you want the recipient to see.

   - **Send response to**: The email address the recipient can send responses to. If not specified, your respondents won't be able to reach you by email.

   - **Subject**: Email subject.

   - **Text**: Email text.

   - If necessary, add headers to the message. Specify a name and value for each header.

   You can insert a response to a prompt or other form data in any field:

   - Select the field and click ![](../_assets/forms/add-var.png) to the right.

   - Select a [variable](vars.md) from the list to add to the field. For example, you can add a variable to address the user by their name or to include their [test results](tests.md) in the email.

1. To attach a file from your computer to the email, click **Attach file**.

   To attach the files that the user sent in response to the form to your email, select prompts like <q>File</q> from the **Attach files from responses to prompts** list.</p>

   {% if audience == "external" %}

   {% note info %}

   The maximum total size of all files attached is 9 GB.

   {% endnote %}

   {% endif %}

1. To display a message informing the user that an email was sent after they filled out the form, enable the **Show messages about the results of actions** option under the action name.

1. Click **Save**.

To send multiple email notifications at once, add new actions using the ![](../_assets/forms/mail-notification-new.png) **Email** button at the bottom of the action group.

If you want notifications to only be sent to users who gave certain responses, [set your conditions](notifications.md#section_xlw_rjc_tbb).

> Sample notification for a form with a questionnaire for job applicants Once the form is filled out, responses to the questionnaire are sent to the HR department's email address.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If you set up email notifications but aren't getting emails when your form is filled out, check your spam folder and see if there are errors when sending emails.

### Check your spam folder
If you aren't receiving email notifications, check your <q>Spam</q> folder. If emails from {{ forms-full-name }} were sent to the Spam folder, mark them as <q>Not spam</q>.

{% if audience == "external" %} If you use your own mail server, <q>whitelist</q> the sender addresses: `form_id@forms-mailer.yaconnect.com` and `sndr.bnc@yandex.ru`.{% endif %}

### Check the email text

The mail server can block an email if its text is missing or looks like spam. Fill out or edit the email text.

### Check for errors when sending emails

1. Open the form with notification issues and click **Integration** at the top of the page.

1. Check for an error message in your notification settings.

1. If there's an error message, try to [restart sending notifications](notifications.md#status).

1. If the problem persists, [contact {{ forms-full-name }} support](feedback.md).

### If there are no spam notifications or error messages

If you have no notifications in the <q>Spam</q> folder or errors in the **Integration** tab, the email may be blocked by the recipient's mail server. To find out why the email is blocked:

1. Open the form with notification issues and click **Integration** at the top of the page.

1. In the email notification settings, go to the **Send response to** field and enter your personal or corporate email.

1. The next time the mail server blocks a notification from the form, an error message will be sent to the email that you specified. Copy the message text.

1. [Contact {{ forms-full-name }} support](feedback.md) and add the error message that you received to your request.
