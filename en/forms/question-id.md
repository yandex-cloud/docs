# Get IDs for questions and responses

The questions and responses ID are used to prefill the form. There are several ways to get IDs for different types of questions.

## ID of the question {#sec_question}

You can get the question ID in the **Settings** section of the [Edit a response](add-questions.md#section_jpy_2xg_qbb) window.

## IDs for a series of questions {#series}

You can add a series of questions to a form several times. This means that questions from a series may repeat. To distinguish between multiple instances of the same question, question IDs that belong in a series get a suffix, which is the instance number after a double underscore. The numbers start with zero: `__0`, `__1`, `__2`.

For example, the form has a series of questions:

* <q>Name</q> with ID `text_2643945`.

* <q>Phone</q> with ID `phone_2752014`.

To set pre-filling for a series of questions:

* For the first instance of the series, which is displayed in the form by default, use `text_2643945__0`and `phone_2752014__0` question IDs.

* For the second instance of the series, which can be added by clicking **more "series of questions"**), use `text_2643945__1` and `phone_2752014__1` question IDs.

1. Click the **Advanced parameters** icon in the **Responses** section on the left panel.

{% noteinfo %}

IDs can be edited. IDs of responses to a single question must be unique.

{% endnote %}

## {% if audience == "internal" %} response IDs for the prompt types <q>Rate on a scale</q>, <q>Cities and countries</q>, and <q>YT list</q>{% endif %} {#sec_rating}

{% if audience == "external" %}

You can find out the response IDs in your browser by using developer tools. This feature is available both to the creator and user of the form.

{% else %}

If you don't see the response IDs in the {{ forms-name }} admin panel, you can get them in your browser by using developer tools. For example, for the [<q>Rate on scale</q>](blocks-ref/rating.md) question type, the admin panel shows neither the IDs for the criteria nor for the response options.

{% if locale == "ru" %}

{% endif %}

Let's see how to get IDs using Yandex&#160;Browser:

1. [Open the form by following a link](publish.md#section_link).

1. Open the developer tools using the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+I** (for Windows and Linux) or **âŒ˜ + Option + I** (for macOS).

1. Select the ![](../_assets/forms/select-element.png) tool and click the necessary response field, list, or marker.

1. You'll see a fragment of the page code with the question or response parameters highlighted in the **Elements** tab.

1. Find the ID values in the code:
   * Question ID: Find the `name` parameter value (except for the <q>Rate on a scale</q> question type).

   * Response ID: Find the `value` parameter value.

   {% if audience == "external" %}

   * For the <q>Drop-down list</q> question type, the code lists all available response options.

   {% endif %}

   * For the <q>Rate on scale</q> question type, the `name` parameter has the question ID and criterion ID.
      ![](../_assets/forms/answer-code.png)

   * For the <q>Cities and countries</q>{% if audience == "internal" %} or <q>YT list</q>{% endif %} question type, first enter the desired response in the field, then you'll see its ID in the code.

## Response IDs for {{ wiki-name }} questions {#sec_wiki}

A response ID for the {{ wiki-name }} question type matches the number of the respective row in a {{ wiki-name }} dynamic table.
