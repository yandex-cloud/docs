# Get question and response IDs

Question and response IDs are used for pre-filling forms. There are several ways to get IDs for different prompt types.

## Question ID {#sec_question}

You can find the question ID in the **Settings** section of the [question editing window](add-questions.md#section_jpy_2xg_qbb).

## IDs for a series of questions {#series}

A series of questions can be added to the form several times. This means that questions from a series may repeat. To distinguish between multiple instances of the same question, question IDs that belong in a series get a suffix, which is the instance number after a double underscore. The numbers start with zero, so the suffix may look like `__0`, `__1`, `__2`.

For example, the form has a series of questions:

* <q>Name</q> with question ID `text_2643945`.

* <q>Phone</q> with question ID `phone_2752014`.

To set pre-filling for a series of questions:

* For the first instance of the series, which is displayed on the form by default, use `text_2643945__0` and `phone_2752014__0` question IDs.

* For the second instance of the series, which can be added by clicking **more "series of questions"**, use `text_2643945__1` and `phone_2752014__1` question IDs.

## Response ID {#sec_answer}

You can find the response ID in the old admin panel {{ forms-name }}:

1. Click **Go to the old version** on the top panel.

1. Select a prompt block.

1. In the **Responses** section on the left, click **Show parameters**.

1. Copy the value from the **ID** field.

{% noteinfo %}

You can edit IDs. Response options within a single question must have unique IDs.

{% endnote %}

{% endif %}

## Response IDs {% if audience == "internal" %} for <q>Rate on a scale</q>, <q>Cities and countries</q>, <q>YT list</q>{% endif %} {#sec_rating} questions

{% if audience == "external" %}

You can find out the response IDs in your browser by using developer tools.

{% else %}

If you can't find the response IDs in the {{ forms-name }} admin panel, you can find them in your browser using the developer tools. For example, for a [<q>Rate on a scale</q>](blocks-ref/rating.md) question, criteria and response option IDs aren't displayed in the old or new admin panels.

{% endif %}

To learn about getting IDs, let's use Yandex Browser as an example:

1. [Open the form via the link](publish.md#section_link).

1. Open the developer tools using the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+I** (for Windows and Linux) or **âŒ˜ + Option + I** (for macOS).

1. Select the ![](../_assets/forms/select-element.png) tool and click the necessary response field, list, or marker.

1. On the **Elements** tab, a fragment of the page code with the question or response parameters is highlighted.

1. Find the ID values in the code:

    * Question ID: Find the `name` parameter value (except for the <q>Rate on a scale</q> question type).

    * Response ID: Find the `value` parameter value.

    {% if audience == "external" %}

    * For the <q>Drop-down list</q> question type, the code lists all available response options.

    ![](../_assets/forms/code-list.png)

    {% endif %}

    * For the <q>Rate on a scale</q> question time, the `name` parameter has the question ID and criterion ID.

    ![](../_assets/forms/answer-code.png)

    * For the <q>Cities and countries</q>{% if audience == "internal" %} or <q>YT list</q>{% endif %} question times, enter the response you want first, and you'll see its ID in the code.

## Response IDs for the {{ wiki-name }} {#sec_wiki} question type

The response ID for the {{ wiki-name }} question type corresponds to the row number in the dynamic table {{ wiki-name }}.
