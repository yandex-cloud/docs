# How to log in to {{ forms-full-name }} for business

To work with [{{ forms-full-name }} for business](forms-for-org.md), log in to your account in the organization. You can [create and edit](new-form.md) forms linked to your organization. You can also fill out forms [published only for the employees of the organization](restrictions.md#sec_access).

1. Go to the business form management page [{{ link-forms-b2b }}]({{ link-forms-b2b }}).

1. Log in to the account you use for work in your organization:
   - To log in using a Yandex email address or an address on your organization's domain, click **Log in to your Yandex account** and enter your username in the format `{{ example-account }}` or `login@example.com`.
   - If your organization uses a Single Sign-On system set up via Identity Federation, click **Log in with SSO**, enter the federation ID, and log in to your work account.

   You can get the federation ID from your organization's administrator. You can learn more about identity federations in the [{{ org-full-name }} documentation](../organization/add-federation.md).

   If you don't have an organization, it will be [created automatically](enable-forms.md) when you first log in to {{ forms-full-name }} for business.
