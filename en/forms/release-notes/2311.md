# {{ forms-full-name }} release notes: November 2023

* [Presenting the <q>One option</q> prompt as asterisks](#radiobutton-choice-star)
* [Integration with dynamic {{ wiki-name }} tables](#wiki-grid)
* [New prompt type: <q>Tracker</q>](#new-question-type-tracker)

## Presenting the <q>One option</q> prompt as asterisks {#radiobutton-choice-star}

[Business forms](../forms-for-org.md) now support presenting responses to the [<q>One option</q>](../blocks-ref/radiobutton.md) prompt as asterisks. Items shown as asterisks are arranged in a single row. The maximum number of response options per row is 10, the rest of them carried over to the next row. When hovering over an item, a response option is displayed as text.

## Integration with {{ wiki-name }} dynamic tables {#wiki-grid}

Now, you can easily integrate [{{ wiki-name }} dynamic tables](../../wiki/create-grid.md) created in the [new editor](../../wiki/pages-types.md#new-editor) with forms:

1. Specify the address of a dynamic table.
1. In **Select action**, choose a table you want to integrate.
1. Select the columns and specify what results from the forms you want to see in these columns.

For more information, see [{#T}](../send-wiki.md#grid).

## New prompt type: <q>Tracker</q> {#new-question-type-tracker}

There is a new prompt type called [Tracker](../blocks-ref/tracker.md). Users can select {{ tracker-name }} entities from the list of suggested options. The type of entity is defined in the prompt settings, and the list is built based on the user permissions in {{ tracker-name }}.
