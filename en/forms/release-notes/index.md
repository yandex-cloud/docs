* [Updated the theme settings page](#theme-update).

* [Added the **Table** tab to the response page](#answers-table).

## Updated the theme settings page {#theme-update}

Updated the interface on the [theme settings page](../appearance.md#section_sgz_my3_j3b). The page is now more informative: the controls are now grouped in sections for easier and faster search.

## Added filtering by date and time to the response page {#answers-dt-filter}

You can now use the date and time filter on the [response page](../answers.md) on the **Timeline** and **Table** tabs. To select responses for a specific period, click **For all time**, set the start and end of the period and click **Apply**. The **Statistics** tab always shows data for the whole period.

## Added the _Table_ tab to the response page {#answers-table}

Added the **Table** tab to the [response page](../answers.md). The tab displays response information as a table.
