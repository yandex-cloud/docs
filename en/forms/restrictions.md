# Limit responses

When publishing a form, you can limit the period for submitting responses and the total number of  responses. You can also restrict access by only allowing responses from employees in your organization in {{ org-full-name }}.

## Limit the date range for responses {#sec_period}

To limit the period during which users can fill out the form:

1. Select the form and open the **Settings** → **Additional** tab.

1. In the **Timeframe for accepting responses** block, enable the **Limited time** option.

1. Set the date and time range for when you want the form to be active. These restrictions will apply in the context of your time zone and current time.

1. Click **Save**.

## Limit the number of respondents {#sec_number}

To limit the total number of respondents that can fill out the form:

1. Select the form and open the **Settings** → **Additional** tab.

{% note tip %}

To disable form resubmission, [generate unique keys](publish.md#personal-link). If a user follows a unique link key, they can only fill out the form once.

{% endnote %}


## Only allow responses from employees {#sec_access}

1. Select a form and open the **Settings** → **Access** tab.

1. In **Who can fill out the form**, select **Only employees of the organization**.
