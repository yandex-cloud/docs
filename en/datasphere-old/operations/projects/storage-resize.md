# Resizing project storage

To resize project storage:

1. {% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/first-step.md) %}
1. Go to the **Projects** tab.
1. Select the project you want to edit and click it. Wait for the project to load.
1. In the upper left-hand corner, click **File** â†’ **Change project disk size**. In the pop-up window, you will see current, minimum, and maximum storage size.
1. Specify the desired size as an integer.
1. Click **Resize**.
1. The project will reload and automatically open the management console **Projects** tab. Resizing storage may take some time. Once this is complete, the project will become available to work with once again.
