# Sharing a notebook

You can export a notebook as a link to an HTML report. The report saves all calculation results and cell explanations so that you can send the link to customers or publish the results on your website. Exporting in other formats is currently not supported.

{% note warning %}

The link is valid for a week.

{% endnote %}

## Before you start {#before-begin}

Make sure you save all changes. The last saved state of the notebook is exported.

To save the changes, on the notebook tab, click ![Save](../../../_assets/datasphere/jupyterlab/save.svg).

## Get a link to the project in HTML format {#get-html-link}

1. {% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/first-step.md) %}
1. Go to the **Projects** tab.
1. Select the project you want to export and click ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis.svg).
1. Select **Export**.

  A report with all the results opens on a new browser tab. You can copy the link from the browser address bar and share it.
