# Sharing a notebook

{% include [link-on-new-ui-datasphere-in-old-ui](../../../_includes/datasphere/datasphere-old-note.md) %}

You can export a notebook as a link to an HTML report. The report saves all calculation results and cell explanations so that you can send the link to customers or publish the results on your website. Exporting in other formats is currently not supported.

{% note warning %}

The link is valid for a week.

{% endnote %}

To save the changes, on the notebook tab, click ![Save](../../../_assets/datasphere/jupyterlab/save.svg).
