The cost of support under the service plan is fixed at {{ sku|KZT|support.business.fixed_consumption.v1|string }} per month plus an additional amount, which is calculated as a percent of the cost of resources consumed for the current month, if such cost exceeds ₸360000.

The consumption cost percentage is calculated as follows:

* If the consumption amount is more than ₸360000 but less than ₸1200000, the additional cost is 7% the difference of the consumption amount minus ₸360000.
* If the consumption amount is more than ₸1200000, the additional cost is ₸58800 plus 5% the difference of the consumption amount minus ₸1200000.
