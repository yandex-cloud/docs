The cost of support under the service plan is fixed at {{ sku|RUB|support.business.fixed_consumption.v1|int|string }} per month plus an additional amount, which is calculated as a percent of the cost of resources consumed for the current month, if such cost exceeds ₽60000.

The consumption cost percentage is calculated as follows:

* If the consumption amount is more than ₽60000 but less than ₽200000, the additional cost is 7% the difference of the consumption amount minus ₽60000.
* If the consumption amount is more than ₽200000, the additional cost is ₽9800 plus 5% the difference of the consumption amount minus ₽200000.
