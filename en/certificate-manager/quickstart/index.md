# Getting started with {{ certificate-manager-name }}

By following these instructions, you'll create your first [Let's Encrypt certificate](../concepts/managed-certificate.md) and use it to [set up HTTPS access](../../storage/operations/hosting/certificate.md) to a static website hosted in {{ objstorage-full-name }}.

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

To get started with {{ certificate-manager-name }}, you need:

1. A folder in {{ yandex-cloud }}. If you don't have a folder, create one:

   {% include [create-folder](../../_includes/create-folder.md) %}

1. A third-level (or higher) domain that the Let's Encrypt certificate is issued for.

   {% note info %}

   To pass the domain rights check, you must have control of the domain.

   {% endnote %}

1. A public bucket in Object Storage with exactly the same name as the domain. If that bucket doesn't exist, create it:

   {% list tabs %}

   - Management console

      1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you want to create a [bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md).
      1. Select **{{ objstorage-name }}**.
      1. Click **Create bucket**.
      1. Enter exactly the same name for the bucket as the domain name.
      1. Select the **Public** [access](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md#bucket-access) type.
      1. Select the default [storage class](../../storage/concepts/storage-class.md).
      1. Click **Create bucket** to complete the operation.

   {% endlist %}

1. Set up [hosting](../../storage/operations/hosting/setup.md) in your bucket:

   {% list tabs %}

   - Management console

      1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select **{{ objstorage-name }}**.
      1. On the **Buckets** tab, click on the bucket named as the domain.
      1. In the left panel, select **Website**.
      1. Select **Hosting** and enter your website home page.
      1. Click **Save** to complete the operation.

   {% endlist %}

1. Set up an [alias](../../storage/operations/hosting/own-domain.md) for the bucket through your DNS provider or on your own DNS server.

   For instance, for the `www.example.com` domain, add the following record:

   ```
   www.example.com CNAME www.example.com.{{ s3-web-host }}
   ```
1. Install and configure the AWS CLI by following our [instructions](../../storage/tools/aws-cli.md#before-you-begin).

## Create a request for a Let's Encrypt certificate {#request-certificate}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
   1. Select **{{ certificate-manager-name }}**.
   1. Click **Add certificate**.
   1. In the menu that opens, select **Let's Encrypt certificate**.
   1. In the window that opens, enter a name for the certificate.
   1. (Optional) Add a description for the certificate.
   1. In the **Domains** field, specify the domains you want to issue the certificate for.
   1. Select the [type of check](../concepts/challenges.md) for domain rights: `HTTP`.
   1. Click **Create**.

{% endlist %}

## Passing the domain rights check {#validate}

1. Create a file for the check:
   1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
   1. Select **{{ certificate-manager-name }}**.
   1. Select a certificate with the `Validating` status in the list and click it.
   1. Under **Check rights for domains**:
      1. Copy the link from the **Link for hosting file field**:
         * The part of the link like `http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/` is the path to host your file at.
         * The second part of the link, `rG1Mm1bJ...`, is the file name that you should use.
      1. Copy the contents of the file from the **Contents** field.
1. Upload the created file to the bucket so that it's hosted in the directory `.well-known/acme-challenge`:

   {% list tabs %}

   - AWS CLI

      ```bash
      aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
         s3 cp <file name> s3://<bucket name>/.well-known/acme-challenge/<file name>
      ```

   {% endlist %}

1. Wait until the certificate status changes to `Issued`.
1. Delete the file you created from the bucket:

   {% list tabs %}

   - AWS CLI

      ```bash
      aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
         s3 rm s3://<bucket name>/.well-known/acme-challenge/<file name>
      ```

   {% endlist %}


{% note warning %}

To renew a certificate, you have to perform certain actions. Keep track of the lifecycle of your certificates to renew them on time. For more information, see [Renew a certificate](../concepts/managed-certificate.md#renew).

{% endnote %}

## Set up static website access over HTTPS {#hosting-certificate}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Log in to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
   1. Select **{{ objstorage-name }}**.
   1. On the **Buckets** tab, click on the bucket named as the domain.
   1. Go to the **HTTPS** tab.
   1. In the panel that opens on the right, click **Configure**.
   1. Under **Source**, select **{{ certificate-manager-name }}**.
   1. In the **Certificate** field, select the certificate from the list that opens.
   1. Click **Save**.
