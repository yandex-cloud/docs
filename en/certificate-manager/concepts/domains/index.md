# Domain

{% include [preview-stage](../../../_includes/certificate-manager/preview-stage.md) %}

A domain is a unique domain name that can be used in [various {{ yandex-cloud }} services](services.md) that require confirmation of the user's rights to the domain.

## Confirming rights for domains {#confirmation}

To confirm your ownership of a domain, link a valid [Let's Encrypt<sup>Â®</sup>](../managed-certificate.md) certificate to it. Once you confirm your rights, no other user will be able to confirm their rights to a domain with the same domain name.

{% note warning %}

* You can't create a domain that was confirmed by another user.

* The period of domain ownership after its confirmation is one year.

    After this period expires, you need to confirm domain ownership again.

{% endnote %}

## Domain statuses {#statuses}

Domains can have the following statuses:

* `Validating`: The domain is pending the domain rights check.
* `Valid`: The domain is confirmed and can be used in services integrated with {{ certificate-manager-name }}.
* `Invalid`: The domain failed the domain rights check.
* `Revalidating`: The domain is pending the domain rights recheck as the previous check validity expired.
