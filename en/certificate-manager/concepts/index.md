# Concepts {{ certificate-manager-name }}

{{ certificate-manager-name }} is a service for managing [TLS certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate#TLS/SSL_server_certificate) in Yandex.Cloud. You can use the service to obtain and update Let's Encrypt<sup>Â®</sup> certificates and add your own certificates.

{% note warning %}

* If you use a Let's Encrypt certificate, [check domain rights](challenges.md) after you add it.
* If you have a user certificate, be sure to renew it on time.

{% endnote %}

## Certificate types {#types}

{{ certificate-manager-name }} supports two types of certificates:

* Let's Encrypt certificates (`Managed` certificates): Certificates issued through [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) and managed by {{ certificate-manager-name }}. For more information about these certificates, see [Let's Encrypt certificate](managed-certificate.md).
* User certificates (`Imported` certificates): Certificates added by the user. You are responsible for renewing these certificates on time. For more information about these certificates, see [User certificate](imported-certificate.md).

## Certificate statuses  {#statuses}

The lifecycle and statuses of certificates depend on their type.

* Let's Encrypt certificates (`Managed` certificates) can have the following statuses:
    * `Validating`: The certificate was requested from Let's Encrypt and is pending the domain rights check.
    * `Issued`: The certificate was obtained and can be used in services integrated with {{ certificate-manager-name }}.
    * `Invalid`: The certificate failed the check (the domain rights check took more than one week or failed).
    * `Renewing`: The certificate is being renewed.
    * `Renewal_failed`: The certificate failed to renew.
* User certificates (`Imported` certificates) always have the `Issued` status: the certificate was obtained and can be used in services integrated with {{ certificate-manager-name }}.
