         ```bash
         yc cm certificate create --help
         ```

      1. Run the command:

         ```bash
         yc cm certificate create \
         --name <certificate name> \
         --chain <path to the certificate chain file> \
         --key <path to the private key file>
         ...
         ```

   {% endlist %}

   The ID of the restored certificate will be different from the ID that the certificate had when it was saved.

1. Repeat the process for each certificate you want to restore.

The saved [Let's Encrypt<sup>Â®</sup> certificate](../concepts/managed-certificate.md) becomes a [user certificate](../concepts/imported-certificate.md) after it's restored. To [renew](../operations/import/cert-update.md) this certificate, download its latest version yourself.
