        id: fpq6gvvm6piuegbb2nol
        folder_id: b1g7gvsi89m34qmcm3ke
        created_at: "2020-09-15T08:49:11.533771Z"
        name: mymanagedcert
        type: MANAGED
        domains:
        - example.com
        status: VALIDATING
        updated_at: "2020-09-15T08:49:11.533771Z"
        ```

- API

    To create a certificate, use the [requestNew](../../api-ref/Certificate/requestNew.md) method for the [Certificate](../../api-ref/Certificate/) resource.

{% endlist %}

The new certificate now appears in the certificate list with the `Validating` status. This status means that a Let's Encrypt certificate was requested and you need to pass the [domain rights check](cert-validate.md) to process it.
