# Access management in {{ certificate-manager-name }}

In this section, you will learn about:
* [Resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [Roles this service has](#roles-list).
* [Roles required](#choosing-roles) for specific actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

To assign a role for a resource, a user should have the `certificate-manager.admin` role or one of the following roles for that resource:

## Resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

You can assign a role for a [custom certificate](../concepts/imported-certificate.md) via the {{ yandex-cloud }} [CLI](../../cli/cli-ref/certificate-manager/cli-ref/certificate/add-access-binding.md) or [API](../api-ref/authentication.md).

## What roles do I need {#choosing-roles}

The table below lists the roles required for specific actions. You can always assign a role with more permissions. For example, you can assign the `editor` role instead of `viewer`.

Action | Methods | Required roles

**Certificate Manager** | | 
Getting lists of certificates | `list` | `viewer` for the folder
Get certificate details | `get` | `viewer` for certificate or folder
[Adding](../operations/managed/cert-create.md) a Let's Encrypt certificate | `requestNew` | `editor` for folder
[Updating](../operations/managed/cert-modify.md) and [deleting](../operations/managed/cert-delete.md) a Let's Encrypt certificate | `update`, `delete` | `editor` for certificate or folder
[Adding](../operations/import/cert-create.md) a custom certificate | `create` | `editor` for the folder
[Renewing](../operations/import/cert-update.md), [updating](../operations/import/cert-modify.md), or [deleting](../operations/import/cert-delete.md) a custom certificate | `update`, `delete` | `editor` for certificate or folder
Getting the contents of a [custom certificate](../operations/import/cert-get-content.md) or [Let's Encrypt certificate](../operations/managed/cert-get-content.md) | `get-content` | `certificate-manager.certificates.downloader` for certificate or folder
