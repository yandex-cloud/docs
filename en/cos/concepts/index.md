# COI ({{ coi }})

_{{ coi }}_ is a VM [image](../../compute/concepts/image.md) optimized for running Docker containers. The image includes Ubuntu LTS, Docker, and a daemon for launching Docker containers.

It is integrated with the {{ yandex-cloud }} platform, which allows you to:
* Run a Docker container immediately after the VM is created from the management console or YC CLI.
* Update running Docker containers with minimum downtime.
* Access Docker container open network ports without any additional settings.
