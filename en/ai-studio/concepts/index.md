# About {{ ai-studio-full-name }}

{{ ai-studio-full-name }} is a platform for building AI agents and leveraging large generative models effectively. 

[{{ model-gallery-name }}](./generation/index.md) offers a wide range of generative models for working with text and images. You can use them to: 
Generate product descriptions, articles, news stories, newsletters, blog posts, advertising images, logos, and much more. To access the models running in the _common instance_, use {{ ai-playground }} or integrate them into your apps with {{ ml-sdk-name }} and various APIs. If the model is missing from the common instance or is required for heavy workloads, you can deploy a _[dedicated instance](./generation/dedicated-instance.md)_ right in the management console. For large amounts of homogenous data, you might want to use [batch processing mode](./generation/dedicated-instance.md).

In addition to generative models, {{ model-gallery-name }} offers text [classifiers](./classifier/index.md) and [embedding models](./embeddings.md). If you are not satisfied with the response format of generative models or the behavior of classifiers and embeddings, you can [fine-tune](./tuning/index.md) them.

The [{{ agents-atelier-name }}](./agents/index.md) development environment supports building text and voice AI agents that can use ready-made customizable [tools](./agents/index.md#tools). If ready-to-use tools are not enough, you can always build a custom MCP server in {{ mcp-hub-name }} to enable the agent to use any external tools and APIs.

For those who prefer creating agents in a graphical editor, {{ ai-studio-name }} offers a {{ sw-full-name }} builder.

The {{ ai-studio-name }} API is fully compatible with the {{ openai }} API: use the {{ responses-api }} to create text agents, the {{ realtime-api }} to create voice agents, and the {{ vector-store-name }} API to search through documents. The APIs support integration with such widely used frameworks as LangChain and LangGraph.
