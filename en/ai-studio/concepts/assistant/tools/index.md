# Tools for retrieval of additional information

AI assistants can rely on additional information sources, such as internal knowledge bases or web search, to perform tasks. To access these sources, you can use certain specialized _tools_, i.e., additional modules you can integrate with your AI assistants.

{{ foundation-models-name }} provides pre-integrated tools for {{ assistant-api }}:

* [VectorStore](./vector-store.md)
* [WebSearch](./web-search.md)

You can connect multiple tools to an AI assistant at the same time.
