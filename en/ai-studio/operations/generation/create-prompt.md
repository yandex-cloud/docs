  1. Create a file named `index.py` and add the following code to it:

      ```python
      import openai

      YANDEX_CLOUD_MODEL = "yandexgpt-lite"

      client = openai.OpenAI(
          api_key=YANDEX_CLOUD_API_KEY,
          base_url="https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/v1",
          project= YANDEX_CLOUD_FOLDER
      )

      response = client.responses.create(
          model=f"gpt://{YANDEX_CLOUD_FOLDER}/{YANDEX_CLOUD_MODEL}",
          input="Come up with three off-beat ideas for a travel startup.",
          temperature=0.8,
          max_output_tokens=1500
      )

      print(response.output[0].content[0].text)
      ```

      export YANDEX_CLOUD_API_KEY=<API_key>
      ```

The user can ask questions and get answers in real time with the AR technology responsible for visualization.

      3. **AI-based travel management service.** A platform that relies on AI algorithms to personalize your travels. AI can analyze the userâ€™s preferences, budget, season, etc., and propose optimized routes, including flights, transfers, accommodations, and activities. The service can also propose alternatives if there is a change of schedule or other unforeseen events.
