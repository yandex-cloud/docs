title: Managing {{ vector-store-name }} search index
description: Follow this guide to use the {{ vector-store-name }} API to create, modify, and delete a search index, which will allow you to implement a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) scenario using {{ retrieval-tool-name }}.

# Managing {{ vector-store-name }} search index

[AI agents](../../concepts/agents/index.md) can use semantic search based on context obtained from external knowledge base files. This additional context is stored in {{ vector-store-name }} [search indexes](../../concepts/search/vectorstore.md): special {{ foundation-models-full-name }} vector storages created using the {{ vector-store-name }} API, in which documents are represented as vectors ([embeddings](../../concepts/embeddings.md)).

## Getting started {#before-begin}

To use the examples:

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- Python {#python}

  1. [Create](../../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) a service account and [assign](../../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md) the `ai.assistants.editor` and `ai.languageModels.user` [roles](../../security/index.md#service-roles) to it.
  1. [Get](../get-api-key.md#run-client) the service account [API key](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/api-key.md) and save it.
  
        {% note info %}
        
        If you are using [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), we recommend [installing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) the [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) shell first and then using it to perform other operations.
        
        {% endnote %}

  1. {% include [sdk-before-begin-step3](../../../_includes/ai-studio/sdk-before-begin-step3.md) %}
  1. {% include [sdk-before-begin-step4](../../../_includes/ai-studio/sdk-before-begin-step4.md) %}
  1. {% include [sdk-before-begin-step5](../../../_includes/ai-studio/sdk-before-begin-step5.md) %}
  1. Install the OpenAI [library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) for Python:

      ```bash
      pip install openai
      ```

{% endlist %}

## Upload the source files {#upload-files}

Before creating a search index, upload the files you want to index to {{ vector-store-name }}:

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- Python {#python}

  1. {% include [download-context-file-step](../../../_includes/ai-studio/assistants/download-context-file-step.md) %}
  1. Create a file named `upload.py` and paste the following code into it:

      ```python
      import os
      import pathlib
      import time
      from openai import OpenAI

      YANDEX_API_KEY = "<API_key>"
      YANDEX_FOLDER_ID = "<folder_ID>"


      # Local file for indexing
      def local_path(path: str) -> pathlib.Path:
          return pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / path


      def main():
          client = OpenAI(
              api_key=YANDEX_API_KEY,
              base_url="https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/v1",
              project=YANDEX_FOLDER_ID,
          )

          # Uploading multiple files
          file_names = ["bali.md", "kazakhstan.md"]
          file_ids = []

          print("Uploading files...")
          for fname in file_names:
              f = client.files.create(
                  file=open(local_path(fname), "rb"),
                  # The `assistants` value is used for all files that need to connect
                  # to the Vector Store API
                  purpose="assistants",
              )
              print(f"{fname} uploaded:", f.id)
              file_ids.append(f.id)


      if __name__ == "__main__":
          main()
      ```

      Where:

      * `YANDEX_API_KEY`: Service account [API key](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/api-key.md) you got before you started.
      * `YANDEX_FOLDER_ID`: ID of the [folder](../../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) for operations with the {{ vector-store-name }} API.

  1. Run the file you created:

      ```bash
      python3 upload.py
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      Uploading files...
      bali.md uploaded: fvt5ajp8l83v********
      kazakhstan.md uploaded: fvtbq10jv46r********
      ```

      Save the uploaded files' IDs you got: you will need them to create a search index.

{% endlist %}

## Create a {{ vector-store-name }} search index {#create-index}

Create a search index from the files uploaded in the previous step:

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- Python {#python}

  1. Create a file named `index.py` and paste the following code into it:

      ```python
      import os
      import pathlib
      import time
      from openai import OpenAI

      YANDEX_API_KEY = "<API_key>"
      YANDEX_FOLDER_ID = "<folder_ID>"


      def main():
          client = OpenAI(
              api_key=YANDEX_API_KEY,
              base_url="https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/v1",
              project=YANDEX_FOLDER_ID,
          )

          input_file_ids = ["<file_1_ID>", "<file_2_ID>"]

          # Creating a search index with several files
          print("Creating a search index...")
          vector_store = client.vector_stores.create(
              # Descriptive index name
              name="Support knowledge base",
              # Your file labels
              metadata={"key": "value"},
              # Index lifetime
              # last_active_at: since last active
              expires_after={"anchor": "last_active_at", "days": 1},
              # or created_at: since created
              # expires_after={"anchor": "created_at", "days": 1},
              file_ids=input_file_ids,  # <- list of files
          )
          vector_store_id = vector_store.id
          print("Vector store created:", vector_store_id)

          # Waiting for the search index to get ready
          while True:
              vector_store = client.vector_stores.retrieve(vector_store_id)
              print("Vector store status:", vector_store.status)
              # in_progress: Index building in progress (files are being uploaded, divided into fragments, embeddings are being calculated).
              # completed: All set, you can begin searching.
              # failed: Something went wrong while building the index.
              if vector_store.status == "completed":
                  break
              time.sleep(2)

          print("Vector store is ready for use.")


      if __name__ == "__main__":
          main()
      ```

      Where `input_file_ids` is a list of IDs of uploaded source files.

  1. Run the file you created:

      ```bash
      python3 index.py
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      Creating a search index...
      Vector store created: fvt9ef7q28n5b2c9quh8
      Vector store status: in_progress
      Vector store status: in_progress
      Vector store status: in_progress
      Vector store status: in_progress
      Vector store status: completed
      Vector store is ready for use.
      ```

      Save the resulting index ID. You will need it to execute a search query.

{% endlist %}

## Run a search through the {{ vector-store-name }} index {#search-index}

To run a search through the index, provide the index ID and the text of your query to the {{ vector-store-name }} API:

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- Python {#python}

  1. Create a file named `query.py` and paste the following code into it:

      ```python
      import os
      import pathlib
      import time
      from openai import OpenAI

      YANDEX_API_KEY = "<API_key>"
      YANDEX_FOLDER_ID = "<folder_ID>"


      def main():
          client = OpenAI(
              api_key=YANDEX_API_KEY,
              base_url="https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/v1",
              project=YANDEX_FOLDER_ID,
          )

          index_id = "<search_index_ID>"

          # Searching through the index
          query = "Cost of a trip to Bali"
          print(f"Searching based on query: {query}")
          results = client.vector_stores.search(index_id, query=query)
          for r in results:
              print("Result:", r)


      if __name__ == "__main__":
          main()
      ```

      Where `index_id` is the {{ vector-store-name }} search index ID you got in the previous step.

  1. Run the file you created:

      ```bash
      python3 query.py
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      Searching based on query: Cost of a trip to Bali
      Result: VectorStoreSearchResponse(attributes={}, content=[Content(text='**Bali is a tropical paradise 
      full of unforgettable experiences!**\n\nWe invite you to spend an amazing vacation in Bali. This 
      magical Indonesian island is famous for its beautiful beaches, unique culture, and warm hospitality

      valid=True)], file_id='fvt5ajp8l83v********', filename='bali.md', score=0.9999999979850982, valid=True)

      Result: VectorStoreSearchResponse(attributes={}, content=[Content(text='**Kazakhstan: A journey 
      to the heart of Eurasia**\n\nDiscover Kazakhstan, a fascinating country where East meets West. 
      Enjoy its endless steppes, majestic mountains, historical landmarks,

      type='text', valid=True)], file_id='fvtbq10jv46r********', filename='kazakhstan.md', score=0.0, 
      valid=True)
      ```

      As a result, the {{ vector-store-name }} API will return text fragments stating the file name and ID, as well as the search query's relevance score for each fragment.

{% endlist %}

## Remove one of the source files from the index {#remove-file}

To remove a source file from the search index, provide the index ID and the file ID to the {{ vector-store-name }} API:

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- Python {#python}

  1. Create a file named `remove_file.py` and paste the following code into it:

      ```python
      import os
      import pathlib
      import time
      from openai import OpenAI

      YANDEX_API_KEY = "<API_key>"
      YANDEX_FOLDER_ID = "<folder_ID>"


      def main():
          client = OpenAI(
              api_key=YANDEX_API_KEY,
              base_url="https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/v1",
              project=YANDEX_FOLDER_ID,
          )

          index_id = "<search_index_ID>"

          file_to_delete = "<ID_of_file_to_delete>"

          # Deleting one file from the index
          print("Deleting one file from the search index...")
          deleted_file = client.vector_stores.files.delete(
              file_to_delete, vector_store_id=index_id
          )
          print(f"{file_to_delete} deleted from index:", deleted_file)


      if __name__ == "__main__":
          main()
      ```

      Where:

      * `index_id`: {{ vector-store-name }} search index ID you got earlier.
      * `file_to_delete`: ID of the file you need to delete. You got the IDs earlier when uploading the files and when performing a search query.

  1. Run the file you created:

      ```bash
      python3 remove_file.py
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      Deleting one file from the search index...
      fvt5ajp8l83v******** deleted from the index: VectorStoreFileDeleted(id='fvt5ajp8l83v********', deleted=True, object='vector_store.file.deleted', valid=True)
      ```

{% endlist %}

## Delete the {{ vector-store-name }} search index {#delete-index}

To delete the entire search index, provide its ID to the {{ vector-store-name }} API:

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- Python {#python}

  1. Create a file named `delete_index.py` and paste the following code into it:

      ```python
      import os
      import pathlib
      import time
      from openai import OpenAI

      YANDEX_API_KEY = "<API_key>"
      YANDEX_FOLDER_ID = "<folder_ID>"


      def main():
          client = OpenAI(
              api_key=YANDEX_API_KEY,
              base_url="https://rest-assistant.{{ api-host }}/v1",
              project=YANDEX_FOLDER_ID,
          )

          index_id = "<search_index_ID>"

          # Deleting the entire vector store
          deleted_store = client.vector_stores.delete(index_id)
          print("Vector store deleted:", deleted_store)


      if __name__ == "__main__":
          main()
      ```

      Where `index_id` is the {{ vector-store-name }} search index ID you got earlier.

  1. Run the file you created:

      ```bash
      python3 delete_index.py
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      Vector store deleted: VectorStoreDeleted(id='fvt9ef7q28n5********', deleted=True, object='vector_store.deleted', valid=True)
      ```

{% endlist %}
