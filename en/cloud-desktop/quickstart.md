# Getting started with {{ cloud-desktop-name }}

{% note info %}

This guide contains information on how to create and set up a [desktop group](concepts/desktops-and-groups.md). If you received a link to the [user desktop showcase](concepts/showcase.md) from an admin, proceed to [{#T}](#get-credentials).

{% endnote %}

Create a {{ cloud-desktop-name }} desktop group in your cloud:

1. [Prepare your cloud](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create a desktop group](#create-desktop-group).
1. [Create a desktop](#create-desktop).
1. [Get the connection credentials](#get-credentials).
1. [Connect to the desktop](#connect-desktop).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

1. Sign in or sign up to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). If you do not yet have an account, go to the management console and follow the instructions.
1. On the [**Billing**]({{ link-console-billing }}) page, make sure you have a [billing account](../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) linked and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you do not yet have a billing account, [create one](../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. If you do not have any folder, [create one](../resource-manager/operations/folder/create.md).
1. To make sure your desktops have access to the internet, [set up](../vpc/operations/create-nat-gateway.md) a NAT gateway for the [subnets](../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) that will host them.
