title: Getting started with {{ search-api-full-name }} API v2 interface
description: Follow this guide to set up your {{ yandex-cloud }} workspace and get started with {{ search-api-name }} using the API v2 interface.

# How to get started with the {{ search-api-name }} using API v2

[API v2](../concepts/index.md#api-v2) is the latest and most recommended interface for {{ search-api-name }}. API v2 is fully integrated into the [{{ yandex-cloud }} ecosystem](../../overview/concepts/services.md) and supports both [API key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/api-key.md) authentication as well as the more secure [authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) based on short-lived [IAM tokens](../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-begin](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

To use the examples, install the [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) utilities, plus [gRPCurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) if you are going to use [gRPC API](../api-ref/grpc/).

## Prepare your cloud {#initial-setup}

{% include [prepare-cloud-v2](../../_includes/search-api/prepare-cloud-v2.md) %}

## Create a search query {#form-request}

This request example returns the fifth page of search results for the `Yandex` query. Search type: `Russian`. Search region: Novosibirsk Oblast. Notification language: Russian. The family filter will be applied to the search results. The number of passages is three. The results are grouped by domain and sorted by relevance. Each group contains three documents, and the number of groups returned per page is five.

For more information about the request body parameters, see [{#T}](../concepts/web-search.md#parameters).

{% list tabs group=api_type %}

- REST API {#rest-api}

  1. Create a file with the [request body](../concepts/web-search.md#parameters), e.g., `body.json`, specify the ID of the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) you are going to use to work with {{ search-api-name }} in the `folderId` field:

      **body.json**
      
      ```json
      {
          "query": {
            "searchType": "SEARCH_TYPE_RU",
            "queryText": "Yandex”,
            "familyMode": "FAMILY_MODE_STRICT",
            "page": "4"
          },
          "sortSpec": {
            "sortMode": "SORT_MODE_BY_RELEVANCE",
            "sortOrder": "SORT_ORDER_DESC"
          },
          "groupSpec": {
            "groupMode": "GROUP_MODE_DEEP",
            "groupsOnPage": "5",
            "docsInGroup": "3"
          },
          "maxPassages": "3",
          "region": "65",
          "l10N": "LOCALIZATION_RU",
          "folderId": "<folder_ID>"
      }
      ```
      
  1. Run an http query by specifying the IAM token you got earlier:

      ```bash
      curl \
        --request POST \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        --data "@body.json" \
        "https://searchapi.{{ api-host }}/v2/web/searchAsync"
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      {
       "done": false,
       "id": "sppger465oq1********",
       "description": "WEB search async",
       "createdAt": "2024-10-02T19:51:02Z",
       "createdBy": "bfbud0oddqp4********",
       "modifiedAt": "2024-10-02T19:51:03Z"
      }
      ```

- gRPC API {#grpc-api}

  1. Create a file with the [query body](../concepts/web-search.md#parameters), e.g., `body.json`, specify the ID of the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) you are going to use to work with {{ search-api-name }} in the `folderId` field:

      **body.json**

      ```json
      {
          "query": {
            "search_type": "SEARCH_TYPE_RU",
            "query_text": "Yandex”,
            "family_mode": "FAMILY_MODE_STRICT",
            "page": "4"
          },
          "sort_spec": {
            "sort_mode": "SORT_MODE_BY_RELEVANCE",
            "sort_order": "SORT_ORDER_DESC"
          },
          "group_spec": {
            "group_mode": "GROUP_MODE_DEEP",
            "groups_on_page": "5",
            "docs_in_group": "3"
          },
          "max_passages": "3",
          "region": "65",
          "l10n": "LOCALIZATION_RU",
          "folder_id": "<folder_ID>"
      }
      ```

  1. Run an gRPC call by specifying the IAM token you got earlier:

      ```bash
      grpcurl \
        -rpc-header "Authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        -d @ < body.json \
        searchapi.{{ api-host }}:443 yandex.cloud.searchapi.v2.WebSearchAsyncService/Search
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      {
        "id": "spp3gp3vhna6********",
        "description": "WEB search async",
        "createdAt": "2024-10-02T19:14:41Z",
        "createdBy": "bfbud0oddqp4********",
        "modifiedAt": "2024-10-02T19:14:42Z"
      }
      ```

{% endlist %}

Save the obtained [Operation object](../../api-design-guide/concepts/operation.md) ID (`id` value) for later use.

## Make sure the request was executed successfully {#verify-operation}

Wait until {{ search-api-name }} executes the request and generates a response. This may take from five minutes to a few hours.

Make sure the query was executed successfully:

{% list tabs group=api_type %}

- REST API {#rest-api}

  Run an http query:

  ```bash
  curl \
    --request GET \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
    https://operation.{{ api-host }}/operations/<query_ID>
  ```

  Where:

  * `<IAM_token>`: Previously obtained IAM token.
  * `<query_ID>`: The Operation object ID you saved at the previous step.

  Result:

  ```text
  {
   "done": true,
   "response": {
    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/yandex.cloud.searchapi.v2.WebSearchResponse",
    "rawData": "<Base64_encoded_XML_response_body>"
   },
   "id": "spp82pc07ebl********",
   "description": "WEB search async",
   "createdAt": "2024-10-03T08:07:07Z",
   "createdBy": "bfbud0oddqp4********",
   "modifiedAt": "2024-10-03T08:12:09Z"
  }
  ```

- gRPC API {#grpc-api}

  Run this gRPC call:

  ```bash
  grpcurl \
    -rpc-header "Authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
    -d '{"operation_id": "<query_ID>"}' \
    operation.{{ api-host }}:443 yandex.cloud.operation.OperationService/Get
  ```

  Where:

  * `<IAM_token>`: Previously obtained IAM token.
  * `<query_ID>`: The Operation object ID you saved at the previous step.

  Result:

  ```text
  {
    "id": "spp82pc07ebl********",
    "description": "WEB search async",
    "createdAt": "2024-10-03T08:07:07Z",
    "createdBy": "bfbud0oddqp4********",
    "modifiedAt": "2024-10-03T08:12:09Z",
    "done": true,
    "response": {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/yandex.cloud.searchapi.v2.WebSearchResponse",
      "rawData": "<Base64_encoded_XML_response_body>"
    }
  }
  ```

{% endlist %}

If the `done` field is set to `true` and the `response` object is present in the output, the query has been completed successfully, so you can move on to the next step. Otherwise, repeat the check later.

## Get a response {#get-response}

After {{ search-api-name }} has successfully processed the query:

1. Get the result:

    {% list tabs group=api_type %}

    - REST API {#rest-api}

      ```bash
      curl \
        --request GET \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        https://operation.{{ api-host }}/operations/<query_ID> \
        > result.json
      ```

    - gRPC API {#grpc-api}

      ```bash
      grpcurl \
        -rpc-header "Authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        -d '{"operation_id": "<query_ID>"}' \
        operation.{{ api-host }}:443 yandex.cloud.operation.OperationService/Get \
        > result.json
      ```

    {% endlist %}

    Eventually the search query result will be saved to a file named `result.json` containing a [Base64-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) [XML response](../concepts/response.md) in the `response.rawData` field.

1. Decode the result from `Base64`:

    ```bash
    echo "$(< result.json)" | \
      jq -r .response.rawData | \
      base64 --decode > result.xml
    ```

    The XML response to the query will be saved to a file named `result.xml`.
