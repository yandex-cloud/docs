# Configuring {{ dns-full-name }} for {{ mch-name }} cluster access from other cloud networks

{% include [mdb-peering-intro](../../_includes/tutorials/dataplatform/mdb-dns-peering/intro.md) %}

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

### Assign roles {#assign-roles}

{% include [mdb-peering-check-roles](../../_includes/tutorials/dataplatform/mdb-dns-peering/check-roles.md) %}

### Create a cluster {#create-cluster}

1. Using the command line, navigate to the folder that will contain the {{ TF }} configuration files with an infrastructure plan for the example. Create the directory if it does not exist.

1. Create a multi-host cluster using {{ TF }} and following the [example](../operations/cluster-create.md#creating-a-multi-host-cluster).

### Create other resources {#create-other-resources}

{% include [mdb-peering-create-resources](../../_includes/tutorials/dataplatform/mdb-dns-peering/create-resources.md) %}

### Configure routing between the cloud networks {#configure-routing}

{% include [mdb-peering-configure-routing](../../_includes/tutorials/dataplatform/mdb-dns-peering/configure-routing.md) %}

### Check cluster availability (optional step) {#check-cluster-availability-without-dns}

1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to the `cluster-vm` and `other-vm` virtual machines over SSH.

    {% include [mdb-peering-vm-user](../../_includes/tutorials/dataplatform/mdb-dns-peering/vm-user-warning.md) %}

1. Try [connecting to the cluster](../operations/connect.md):

    {% include [mdb-peering-check-availability-1](../../_includes/tutorials/dataplatform/mdb-dns-peering/check-availability-1.md) %}

## Create a zone in {{ dns-full-name }} {#create-peering-zone}

{% include [mdb-peering-create-zone](../../_includes/tutorials/dataplatform/mdb-dns-peering/create-zone.md) %}

## Make sure the DNS records migrate to the zone {#do-actions-for-migration}

{% include [mdb-peering-migrate-to-zone](../../_includes/tutorials/dataplatform/mdb-dns-peering/migrate-to-zone.md) %}

## Check cluster availability {#check-cluster-availability}

1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to the `cluster-vm` and `other-vm` virtual machines over SSH.

    {% include [mdb-peering-vm-user](../../_includes/tutorials/dataplatform/mdb-dns-peering/vm-user-warning.md) %}

1. Try [connecting to the cluster](../operations/connect.md):

    {% include [mdb-peering-check-availability-2](../../_includes/tutorials/dataplatform/mdb-dns-peering/check-availability-2.md) %}

## Delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

{% include [mdb-peering-destroy-resources](../../_includes/tutorials/dataplatform/mdb-dns-peering/destroy-resources.md) %}
