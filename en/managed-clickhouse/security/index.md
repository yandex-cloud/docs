# Access management in {{ mch-name }}

{% if audience != "internal"%}

In this section, you'll learn:

* [Which resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

## Roles required {#required-roles}

To use the service, you need the `editor` [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) or higher to the folder where a cluster is created. The `viewer` role only enables you to view the cluster list.

You can always assign a role with more permissions. For example, assign the `admin` role instead of `editor`.
