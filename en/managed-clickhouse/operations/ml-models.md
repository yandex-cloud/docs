# Managing machine learning models

{{ mch-short-name }} lets you analyze data by applying [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/) machine learning models without additional tools. To apply a model, add it to your cluster and call it in an SQL query using the built-in [`modelEvaluate()`]({{ ch.docs }}/query_language/functions/other_functions/#function-modelevaluate) function. After running this query, you get model predictions for each row of input data. For more information about machine learning in {{ CH }}, see the [documentation]({{ ch.docs }}/guides/apply_catboost_model/).

## Before adding a model {#prereq}

{{ mch-short-name }} only works with readable models uploaded to {{ objstorage-full-name }}:


1. [Upload](../../storage/operations/objects/upload.md) the trained model file to {{ objstorage-full-name }}.

1. Configure access to the model file using one of the following methods:

   * Use a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) (recommended). This method lets you access the file without entering account information.

      1\. [Connect a service account to a cluster](s3-access.md#connect-service-account).
      2\. [Assign the account the role](s3-access.md#configure-acl) of `storage.viewer`.
      3\. In the bucket ACL, [grant the account](../../storage/operations/buckets/edit-acl.md) `READ` permission.

   * [Enable public access](../../storage/operations/objects/edit-acl.md) to the bucket containing the file.

1. [Get a link](s3-access.md#get-link-to-object) to the model file.

## Applying a model {#apply}

To apply the model to data stored in a {{ CH }} cluster:

1. Connect to the cluster [using the {{ CH }} CLI](../../managed-clickhouse/operations/connect.md#cli) or go to the [SQL](../../managed-clickhouse/operations/web-sql-query.md) tab in the cluster management console.
1. Execute an SQL query like:

   ```
   SELECT
       modelEvaluate('<model name>',
                     <name of column 1>,
                     <name of column 2>,
                     ...
                     <name of column N>)
   FROM <table name>
   ```

Specify the model name and the names of the columns with input data as the `modelEvaluate()` function arguments. The query results in a column with model predictions for each row of the source table.

## Updating a model {#update}

## Example {#example-ml-model}

If you don't have a suitable data set or model to process it, you can test machine learning in {{ mch-short-name }} using this example. We prepared a data file for it and trained a model to analyze it. You can upload data to {{ CH }} and see model predictions for different rows of the table.

{% note info %}

In this example, we'll use public data from the [Amazon Employee Access Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/amazon-employee-access-challenge). The model is trained to predict values in the `ACTION` column. The same data and model are used in the examples provided in the [{{ CH }} documentation]({{ ch.docs }}/guides/apply_catboost_model/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-presentations/blob/master/tutorials/catboost_with_clickhouse_ru.md).

{% endnote %}

To upload data to {{ CH }} and test the model:

1. Install the [{{ CH }} CLI]({{ ch.docs }}/interfaces/cli/) and set up a cluster connection as described in the [documentation](../../managed-clickhouse/operations/connect.md#cli).
1. Download a [data file](https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/managed-clickhouse/train.csv) for analysis:
   ```bash
   wget https://storage.yandexcloud.net/managed-clickhouse/train.csv
   ```

1. Create a table for the data:

   ```bash
   clickhouse-client --host <host FQDN> \
                     --database <DB name>
                     --secure \
                     --user <DB username> \
                     --password <DB user password> \
                     --port 9440 \
                     -q 'CREATE TABLE ml_test_table (date Date MATERIALIZED today(), ACTION UInt8, RESOURCE UInt32, MGR_ID UInt32, ROLE_ROLLUP_1 UInt32, ROLE_ROLLUP_2 UInt32, ROLE_DEPTNAME UInt32, ROLE_TITLE UInt32, ROLE_FAMILY_DESC UInt32, ROLE_FAMILY UInt32, ROLE_CODE UInt32) ENGINE = MergeTree() PARTITION BY date ORDER BY date'
   ```

1. Upload the data to the table:

   ```bash
   clickhouse-client --host <host FQDN> \
                     --database <DB name>
                     --secure \
                     --user <DB username> \
                     --password <DB user password> \
                     --port 9440 \
                     -q 'INSERT INTO ml_test_table FORMAT CSVWithNames' \
                     < train.csv
   ```

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), add the test model:
   * **Type**: `ML_MODEL_TYPE_CATBOOST`.
   * **Name**: `ml_test`.
   * **URL**: `https://storage.yandexcloud.net/managed-clickhouse/catboost_model.bin`.

1. Test the model:
   1. Connect to the cluster [using the {{ CH }} CLI](../../managed-clickhouse/operations/connect.md#cli) or go to the [SQL](../../managed-clickhouse/operations/web-sql-query.md) tab in the cluster management console.
   1. Test the model using queries:
      * Predicted values for first 10 rows of the `ACTION` column:

         ```sql
         SELECT
             modelEvaluate('ml_test',
                           RESOURCE,
                           MGR_ID,
                           ROLE_ROLLUP_1,
                           ROLE_ROLLUP_2,
                           ROLE_DEPTNAME,
                           ROLE_TITLE,
                           ROLE_FAMILY_DESC,
                           ROLE_FAMILY,
                           ROLE_CODE) > 0 AS prediction,
             ACTION AS target
         FROM ml_test_table
         LIMIT 10
         ```

      * Predicted probability for the first 10 rows of the table:

         ```sql
         SELECT
             modelEvaluate('ml_test',
                           RESOURCE,
                           MGR_ID,
                           ROLE_ROLLUP_1,
                           ROLE_ROLLUP_2,
                           ROLE_DEPTNAME,
                           ROLE_TITLE,
                           ROLE_FAMILY_DESC,
                           ROLE_FAMILY,
                           ROLE_CODE) AS prediction,
             1. / (1 + exp(-prediction)) AS probability,
             ACTION AS target
         FROM ml_test_table
         LIMIT 10
         ```
