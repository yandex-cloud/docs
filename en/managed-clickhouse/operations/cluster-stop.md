# Stopping and starting {{ CH }} clusters

If necessary, you can stop and restart a {{ CH }} DB cluster. You are not charged for the time when your cluster is stopped: you only continue to pay for the storage size and backups based on the [pricing policy](../pricing.md#prices-storage).

## Stopping a cluster {#stop-cluster}

{% include [cluster-stop](../../_includes/mdb/cluster-stop.md) %}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) go to the folder page and select **{{ mch-name }}**.
   1. Select the desired cluster in the list, click ![options](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg), and select **Stop**.

   To stop a cluster, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-ch }} cluster stop <cluster name or ID>
   ```

   You can query the cluster ID and name with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

   Use the [stop](../api-ref/Cluster/stop.md) API method and pass the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
