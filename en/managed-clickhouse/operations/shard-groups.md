# Managing groups of shards

You can group several [shards](../concepts/sharding.md) of the cluster {{ CH }} in a _shard group_ and save tables in this group.

## Listing shard groups in a cluster {#list-shard-groups}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) go to the folder page and select **{{ mch-name }}**.
   1. Click on the name of the cluster and open the **Shard groups** tab.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To get a list of shard groups in a cluster, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-ch }} shard-groups list \
      --cluster-name=<cluster name>
   ```

   The cluster name can be requested with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

   Use the [listShardGroups](../api-ref/Cluster/listShardGroups.md) API method: pass the ID of the required cluster in the `clusterId` request parameter.

   To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

{% endlist %}

      For more information about creating this file, see [{#T}](cluster-create.md).
   1. Add a `shard_group` description block to the {{ mch-name }} cluster description.

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_mdb_clickhouse_cluster" "<cluster name>" {
        ...
        shard_group {

   * Name of the shard group, in the `shardGroupName` parameter.
   * A list of shard names to include in the group, in the `shardNames` parameter. To find out the names, [get a list of shards](shards.md#list-shards) in the cluster.

## Changing a shard group {#update-shard-group}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) go to the folder page and select **{{ mch-name }}**.
   1. Click on the name of the cluster and open the **Shard groups** tab.
   1. Click ![image](../../_assets/options.svg) for the desired shard group and select **Edit**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To change a shard group in a cluster, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-ch }} shard-groups update \
      --cluster-name=<cluster name> \
      --name=<shard group name> \
      --description=<new shard group description> \
      --shards=<new list of shards to include in the group>
   ```

   This command replaces the existing list of shards in the group with the new one that was passed to the command in the `--shards` parameter. Before running the command, make sure that you added all the appropriate shards in the new list.

   The cluster name can be requested with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

   You can request the name of the shard group with a [list of shard groups in the cluster](#list-shard-groups).

   Shard names can be requested with a [list of shards in the cluster](shards.md#list-shards).

- {{ TF }}

   1. Open the current {{ TF }} configuration file with an infrastructure plan.

      For more information about creating this file, see [{#T}](cluster-create.md).
   1. In the {{ mch-name }} cluster description, change the `shard_group` block to the required shard group:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_mdb_clickhouse_cluster" "<cluster name>" {
        ...
        shard_group {
          name        = "<new shard group name>"
          description = "<new shard group description>"
          shard_names = [
            # New list of shards in the group
            "<name of shard 1>",
            ...
            "<shard name N>"
          ]
        }

- API

   Use the [updateShardGroup](../api-ref/Cluster/updateShardGroup.md) API method and pass the following in the request:
   * The ID of the cluster where you want to change a group, in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
   * Name of the shard group, in the `shardGroupName` parameter. To find out the name, [get a list of shard groups](#list-shard-groups) in the cluster.
   * If necessary, a new description of the shard group, in the `description` parameter.
   * If necessary, a new list of shard names to be included in the group, in the `shardNames` parameter. To find out the names, [get a list of shards](shards.md#list-shards) in the cluster. This list will replace the current one, so make sure that you added all the appropriate shards in the new list.
   * Names of parameters to change, in the `updateMask` parameter.

## Deleting a group of shards {#delete-shard-group}

Deleting a group of shards doesn't affect the shards in the group: they are kept in the cluster.

Tables created on the deleted group are kept, but they are disabled and attempts to query them result in errors. However, you can delete these tables before or after you delete the shard group.
