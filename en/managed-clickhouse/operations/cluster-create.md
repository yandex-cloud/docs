# Creating a {{ CH }} cluster

A {{ CH }} cluster consists of one or more database hosts you can configure replication between.

{% note info %}

* The number of hosts you can create together with a {{ CH }} cluster depends on the selected [disk type](../concepts/storage.md#storage-type-selection) and [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md#available-flavors).
* Available disk types [depend](../concepts/storage.md) on the selected [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md).

{% endnote %}

The selected [replication mechanism](../concepts/replication.md) also affects the number of hosts in a multi-host cluster:

* A cluster that uses {{ CK }} to manage replication and fault tolerance should consist of three or more hosts with individual hosts not required to run {{ CK }}. You can only create this kind of cluster using the CLI or API.

   
   This feature is in the [Preview stage](../../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md). Access to {{ CK }} is available on request. Contact [support]({{ link-console-support }}) or your account manager.


* When using {{ ZK }}, a cluster can consist of two or more hosts. Another three {{ ZK }} hosts will be added to the cluster automatically.

   The minimum number of cores per {{ ZK }} host depends on the total number of cores on {{ CH }} hosts. To learn more, see [Replication](../concepts/replication.md#zk).

   {% note alert %}

   
   These hosts are taken into account when calculating the consumed cloud [resource quota]({{ link-console-quotas }}) and cluster [cost](../pricing.md#prices-zookeeper).

## How to create a {{ CH }} cluster {#create-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you want to create a DB cluster.
      1. Select a **{{ mch-name }}** service.
   1. Click **Create cluster**.
   1. Name the cluster in the **Cluster name** field. It must be unique within the folder.
   1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you cannot change the environment once the cluster is created):
      * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
      * `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mch-short-name }} service itself. The prestable environment is updated first with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.
   1. Select the {{ CH }} version from the **Version** drop-down list to use for the {{ mch-name }} cluster:
      * For most clusters, it is recommended to select the latest LTS version.
      * If you plan to use hybrid storage in a cluster, we recommend selecting version {{ mch-ck-version }} or higher.

   
   1. If you are expecting to use data from a {{ objstorage-name }} bucket with [restricted access](../../storage/concepts/bucket#bucket-access), select a service account from the drop-down list or create a new one. For more information about setting up service accounts, see [Configuring access to {{ objstorage-name }}](s3-access.md).


   1. Under **Resources**:

      * Select the platform, VM type, and host class that defines the technical specifications of the VMs where the DB hosts will be deployed. All available options are listed under [Host classes](../concepts/instance-types.md). When you change the host class for the cluster, the characteristics of all existing instances change, too.

      
      * Select the [disk type](../concepts/storage.md).

                  
         {% include [storages-step-settings](../../_includes/mdb/settings-storages.md) %}



      * Select the size of disk to be used for data and backups. For more information about how backups take up storage space, see [{#T}](../concepts/backup.md).

   1. Under **Hosts**:

      * To create additional DB hosts, click **Add host**. Once the second host is added, the **Configure {{ ZK }}** button appears. Change the {{ ZK }} settings in **{{ ZK }} resources** and **{{ ZK }} hosts**, if required.
      * Set the parameters of DB hosts being created alongside the cluster. To change the added host, hover over the host line and click ![image](../../_assets/pencil.svg).

   1. Under **DBMS settings**:

      * If you want to manage cluster users via SQL, select **Enabled** in the drop-down list of the **User management via SQL** field and enter the `admin` user password. This disables user management through other interfaces.

         Otherwise, select **Disabled**.

      * If you want to manage databases via SQL, select **Enabled** in the drop-down list of the **Database management via SQL** field. This disables database management through other interfaces. The field is inactive if user management via SQL is disabled.

         Otherwise, select **Disabled**.

         {% include [SQL-management-can't-be-switched-off](../../_includes/mdb/mch/note-sql-db-and-users-create-cluster.md) %}

      * Username and password.

         {% include [user-name-and-password-limits](../../_includes/mdb/mch/note-info-user-name-and-pass-limits.md) %}

      * DB name. The database name may contain Latin letters, numbers, and underscores. The name may not be longer than 63 characters. You cannot create a database named `default`.

      * Enable [hybrid storage](../concepts/storage.md#hybrid-storage-features) for the cluster, if required.

         {% note alert %}

         You cannot disable this option.

         {% endnote %}

      * Configure the [DBMS settings](../concepts/settings-list.md#dbms-cluster-settings), if required.

   
   1. Under **Network settings**, select the cloud network to host the cluster in and security groups for cluster network traffic. You may also need to [set up security groups](connect.md#configuring-security-groups) to connect to the cluster.

      {% include [security-groups-note](../../_includes/vpc/security-groups-note-services.md) %}


   1. Under **Hosts**, select the parameters of database hosts created together with the cluster. To change the settings of a host, click the ![pencil](../../_assets/pencil.svg) icon in the line with its number:

      * **Availability zone**: Select an [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).
      * **Subnet**: Specify a [subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) in the selected availability zone.
      * **Public access**: Allow [access](connect.md) to the host from the internet.

      To add hosts to the cluster, click **Add host**.

   1. Configure cluster service settings, if required:

      {% include [mch-extra-settings](../../_includes/mdb/mch/extra-settings-web-console.md) %}

   1. Click **Create cluster**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To create a cluster:

   
   1. Check whether the folder has any subnets for the cluster hosts:

      ```bash
      yc vpc subnet list
      ```

      If there are no subnets in the folder, [create the required subnets](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) in {{ vpc-short-name }}.


   1. View a description of the create cluster CLI command:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-ch }} cluster create --help
      ```

   1. Specify cluster parameters in the create command (the list of supported parameters in the example is not exhaustive):

      
      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-ch }} cluster create \
        --name <cluster name> \
        --environment <environment: prestable or production> \
        --network-name <network name> \
        --host type=<clickhouse or zookeeper>,`
             `zone-id=<availability zone>,`
             `subnet-id=<subnet ID>,`
             `assign-public-ip=<public access to host: true or false> \

             --cloud-storage-move-factor=<free space ratio>
           ...
         ```

- {{ TF }}

      {% include [terraform-definition](../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}

   To create a cluster:

   1. Using the command line, navigate to the folder that will contain the {{ TF }} configuration files with an infrastructure plan. Create the directory if it does not exist.

      1. If you do not have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and create a configuration file with provider settings](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   1. Create a configuration file describing the [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) and [subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).
      * Network: Description of the [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) where the cluster will be hosted. If you already have a suitable network, you do not need to describe it again.
      * Subnets: [Subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) to connect the cluster hosts to. If you already have suitable subnets, you do not need to describe them again.

      Example structure of a configuration file that describes a cloud network with a single subnet:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_vpc_network" "<network name in {{ TF }}>" { name = "<network name>" }

      resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "<name of subnet in {{ TF }}>" {
        name           = "<subnet name>"
        zone           = "<availability zone>"
        network_id     = yandex_vpc_network.<network name in {{ TF }}>.id
        v4_cidr_blocks = ["<subnet>"]
      }
      ```

   1. Create a configuration file with a description of the cluster and its hosts.

      * Database cluster: Description of the cluster and its hosts. Also as required here:
         * Specify [DBMS settings](../concepts/settings-list.md).
         * Enable deletion protection.

            {% include [Deletion protection limits](../../_includes/mdb/deletion-protection-limits-db.md) %}

      Example structure of a configuration file that describes a cluster with a single host:

      1. {% include [Maintenance window](../../_includes/mdb/mch/terraform/maintenance-window.md) %}

      
      1. To enable access from other services and [SQL query execution from the management console](web-sql-query.md), add an `access` block with the required settings:

         ```hcl
         resource "yandex_mdb_clickhouse_cluster" "<cluster name>" {
           ...
           access {
             data_lens  = <access from DataLens: true or false>
             metrika    = <access from Yandex Metrica and AppMetrika: true or false>
             serverless = <access from Cloud Functions: true or false>
             web_sql    = <executing SQL queries from the management console: true or false>
           }
           ...
         }
         ```

      {% include [explore-resources](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/explore-resources.md) %}

   {% include [Terraform timeouts](../../_includes/mdb/mch/terraform/timeouts.md) %}

- API

   To create a cluster, use the [create](../api-ref/Cluster/create.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/Create](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#Create) gRPC API call and provide the following in the request:
   * ID of the folder where the cluster should be placed, in the `folderId` parameter.
   * Cluster name in the `name` parameter.
   * Cluster environment in the `environment` parameter.
   * Cluster configuration in the `configSpec` parameter.
   * Configuration of the cluster hosts in one or more `hostSpecs` parameters.
   * Network ID in the `networkId` parameter.

   
   * Security group identifiers in the `securityGroupIds` parameter.


   To allow [connection](connect.md) to cluster hosts from the internet, pass the `true` value in the `hostSpecs.assignPublicIp` parameter.

   Enable user and database management via SQL, if required:
   * `configSpec.sqlUserManagement`: Set `true` to enable [managing users via SQL](cluster-users.md#sql-user-management).
   * `configSpec.sqlDatabaseManagement`: Set `true` to enable [database management via SQL](databases.md#sql-database-management). User management via SQL needs to be enabled.
   * `configSpec.adminPassword` : Set the password for the `admin` user whose account is used for management.

   {% include [SQL-management-can't-be-switched-off](../../_includes/mdb/mch/note-sql-db-and-users-create-cluster.md) %}

      To allow cluster access from [{{ sf-full-name }}](../../functions/concepts/index.md), set `true` for the `configSpec.access.serverless` parameter. For more information on setting up access, see the [{{ sf-name }}](../../functions/operations/database-connection.md) documentation.

   {% include [datatransfer access](../../_includes/mdb/api/datatransfer-access-create.md) %}

   To allow cluster access from {{ yq-full-name }}, set `true` for the `configSpec.access.yandexQuery` parameter.

   To configure [hybrid storage settings](../concepts/storage.md##hybrid-storage-settings):

   * Pass `true` in the `configSpec.cloudStorage.enabled` parameter to enable hybrid storage.
   * Pass the hybrid storage settings in the `configSpec.cloudStorage` parameters:

      {% include [Hybrid Storage settings API](../../_includes/mdb/mch/hybrid-storage-settings-api.md) %}

   When creating a cluster with multiple hosts:

   * If `embeddedKeeper` is `true`, replication will be managed using [{{ CK }}](../concepts/replication.md#ck).

      {% include [ClickHouse Keeper can't turn off](../../_includes/mdb/mch/note-ck-no-turn-off.md) %}

      To use {{ CK }}, your {{ CH }} version must be {{ mch-ck-version }} or higher. You can get the list of available {{ CH }} versions using the [list](../api-ref/Versions/list.md) REST API method for the [Versions](../api-ref/Versions/index.md) resource or the [VersionsService/List](../api-ref/grpc/versions_service.md#List) gRPC API call.

   * If `embeddedKeeper` is undefined or `false`, replication and query distribution will be managed using {{ ZK }}.

      
      If the cluster [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md) has subnets in each [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md), and {{ ZK }} host settings are not specified, one such host will automatically be added to each subnet.

      If only some availability zones in the cluster's network have subnets, explicitly specify the {{ ZK }} host settings.

## Examples {#examples}

### Creating a single-host cluster {#creating-a-single-host-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   To create a cluster with a single host, provide a single `--host` parameter.

   Create a {{ mch-name }} cluster with test characteristics:

   
   * Named `mych`.
   * Environment `production`.
   * Network `default`.
   * Security group `{{ security-group }}`.
   * With a single {{ CH }} host of the `{{ host-class }}` class in the `b0rcctk2rvtr8efcch64` subnet and the `{{ region-id }}-a` availability zone.
   * {{ CK }}.
   * With 20 GB of SSD network storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`).
   * With one user, `user1`, with the `user1user1` password.
   * With one database, `db1`.
   * Protection against accidental cluster deletion.


   Run the following command:

   
   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-ch }} cluster create \
     --name mych \
     --environment=production \
     --network-name default \
     --clickhouse-resource-preset {{ host-class }} \
     --host type=clickhouse,zone-id={{ region-id }}-a,subnet-id=b0cl69g98qumiqmtg12a \
     --version {{ versions.keeper }} \
     --embedded-keeper true \
     --clickhouse-disk-size 20 \
     --clickhouse-disk-type {{ disk-type-example }} \
     --user name=user1,password=user1user1 \
     --database name=db1 \
     --security-group-ids {{ security-group }} \
     --deletion-protection=true
   ```


- {{ TF }}

   Create a {{ mch-name }} cluster and a network for it with test characteristics:

   * Named `mych`.
   * In the `PRESTABLE` environment.
   * Cloud with the `{{ tf-cloud-id }}` ID.
   * Folder with the `{{ tf-folder-id }}` ID.
   * A new cloud network named `cluster-net`.
      * A new [default security group](connect.md#configuring-security-groups) named `cluster-sg` (in the `cluster-net` network) that allows connections to any cluster host from any network (including the internet) on ports `8443` and `9440`.
   * With a single `{{ host-class }}` class host on a new subnet named `cluster-subnet-{{ region-id }}-a`.

      Subnet parameters:
      * Address range: `172.16.1.0/24`.
      * Network: `cluster-net`.
      * Availability zone: `{{ region-id }}-a`.

   * With 20 GB of network SSD storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`).
Re   * Database name `db1`.
   * With a user named `user1` with the `user1user1` password.

   The configuration files for this cluster look like this:

   1. Configuration file with a description of provider settings:

      {% include [terraform-provider](../../_includes/mdb/terraform-provider.md) %}

   1. Configuration file with a description of the cloud network and subnet:

      {% include [terraform-mdb-single-network](../../_includes/mdb/terraform-single-network.md) %}

   
   1. Configuration file with a description of the security group:

      {% include [terraform-mch-sg](../../_includes/mdb/mch/terraform/security-groups.md) %}


   1. Configuration file with a description of the cluster and cluster host:
