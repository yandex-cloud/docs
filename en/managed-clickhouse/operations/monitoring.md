## Monitoring cluster status {#monitoring-cluster}

To view detailed information about the {{ mch-name }} cluster status:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) go to the folder page and select **{{ mch-name }}**.
   1. Click on the name of the cluster and open the **Monitoring** tab.

   1. {% include [open-in-yandex-monitoring](../../_includes/mdb/open-in-yandex-monitoring.md) %}

   If the cluster uses a mechanism for replication and distribution of queries using [{{ ZK }}](../concepts/replication.md#zk), the **Monitoring** tab displays the following two tabs:

   * **Clickhouse**: Charts that show the operation of the entire {{ CH }} cluster and hosts.
   * **Zookeeper**: Charts that indicate the performance of {{ ZK }} hosts.

   If replication is not used or [{{ CK }}](../concepts/replication.md#ck) is used, charts from the **Clickhouse** tab are displayed on the general **Monitoring** tab.

## Monitoring the state of hosts {#monitoring-hosts}

To view detailed information about the status of individual {{ mch-name }} hosts:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) go to the folder page and select **{{ mch-name }}**.
   1. Click on the name of the cluster you want and select the **Hosts** tab.
   1. Select the **Monitoring** tab.

## Alert settings in {{ monitoring-full-name }} {#monitoring-integration}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder with the cluster you wish to configure alerts for.
   1. In the list of services, select ![image](../../_assets/monitoring.svg)Â **{{ monitoring-short-name }}**.
   1. Under **Service dashboards**, select.
      * **{{ mch-name }} Cluster Overview** to configure cluster alerts.
      * **{{ mch-name }} ZooKeeper** to configure ZooKeeper host alerts.
      * **{{ mch-name }} Host Overview** to configure host alerts.
   1. In the desired chart with metrics, click ![options](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **Create alert**.
   1. If there are multiple metrics on a chart, select a data query to generate a metric and click **Continue**. For more information about the query language, see the [{{ monitoring-full-name }} documentation](../../monitoring/concepts/querying.md). 
   1. Set the `Alarm` and `Warning` threshold values to trigger the alert.
   1. Click **Create alert**.

{% endlist %}

{% include [other-indicators](../../_includes/mdb/other-indicators.md) %}

Recommended threshold values:

| Metric | Parameter | `Alarm` | `Warning` |
|----------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| Maximum number of data chunks in a partition | `ch_system_async_metrics_MaxPartCountForPartition` | `250` | `150` |
| Number of failed queries | `ch_system_events_FailedQuery_rate` | 20% of the total number of queries | 10% of the total number of queries |
| Storage space used | `disk.used_bytes` | 95% of storage size | 80% of storage size |
| Number of healthy hosts | `is_alive` | `<number of hosts> - 2` | `<number of hosts> - 1` |

To determine the threshold values for the `ch_system_events_FailedQuery_rate` metric, use `Total queries` [for the cluster](#monitoring-cluster).

You can view the current storage size in [detailed information about the cluster](cluster-list.md#get-cluster).

For a complete list of supported metrics, see the [{{ monitoring-name }} documentation](../../monitoring/metrics-ref/index.md#managed-clickhouse).
