# Monitoring the state of a cluster and hosts

Using monitoring tools in the management console, you can track the status of a {{ mch-name }} cluster and its individual hosts. These tools display diagnostic information in the form of charts.

Cluster metric values are collected and charts are displayed by [{{ monitoring-name }}](../../monitoring/concepts/index.md). To get started with {{ monitoring-name }} metrics, dashboards, or alerts, click **Open in Monitoring** in the top panel.

Chart update rate:

* Standard hosts and hosts with an increased RAM to vCPU ratio (`memory-optimized`): {{ graph-update }}.
* Hosts with a guaranteed vCPU share under 100% (`burstable`): {{ graph-update-burstable }}.

{% note info %}

The most appropriate multiple units (MB, GB, and more) are automatically used in charts.

## Monitoring cluster status {#monitoring-cluster}

To view detailed information about the {{ mch-name }} cluster status:

1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mch-name }}**.
1. Click on the name of the cluster and open the **Monitoring** tab.

If the cluster uses a mechanism for replication and distribution of queries using [{{ ZK }}](../concepts/replication.md#zk), the **Monitoring** tab displays the following two tabs:

* **Clickhouse**: Charts that show the operation of the entire {{ CH }} cluster and hosts.
* **Zookeeper**: Charts that indicate the performance of {{ ZK }} hosts.

If replication is not used or [{{ CK }}](../concepts/replication.md#ck) is used, charts from the **Clickhouse** tab are displayed on the general **Monitoring** tab.

{% list tabs %}

  * **Network usage per host**: The rate of data exchange over the network on each host (bytes per second).
  * **Read data**: Data read rate (bytes per second).
  * **Read data per host**: Data read rate on each host (bytes per second).
  * **Read parts per host**: Data part read rate on each host (rows per second).
  * **Select queries**: The number of select queries per second.
  * **Select queries per host**: The number of select queries per second on each host.
  * **Total queries**: The total number of queries per second.
  * **Queries per host**: The total number of queries per second on each host.
  * **Waiting locks per host**: The number of pending locks on each host.

* Zookeeper
  * **Average latency per ZooKeeper host**: The average time it takes each ZooKeeper host to respond.

  * **CPU cores usage**: The number processor cores used.
  * **CPU cores usage per host**: The number of processor cores used on each host.
  * **CPU usage per host**: Usage of processor cores on each host.
  * **Disk read per host**: Disk read rate on each host (bytes per second).
  * **Disk space usage**: Shows how much disk space is used (in bytes). Two charts are displayed: one for each host and one for all hosts.

## Monitoring the state of hosts {#monitoring-hosts}

To view detailed information about the status of individual {{ mch-name }} hosts:

1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mch-name }}**.
1. Click the name of the desired cluster and select **Hosts** â†’ **Monitoring**.
1. Select the host from the drop-down list. The host type is shown next to its name: `CLICKHOUSE` or `ZOOKEEPER`.

This page displays charts showing the load on an individual host in the cluster:

* **CPU**: The loading of processor cores. As the load goes up, the **Idle** value goes down.
* **Disk Bytes**: The speed of disk operations (bytes per second).
* **Disk IOPS**: The number of disk operations per second.
* **Memory**: The use of RAM in bytes. At high loads, the value of the **Free** parameter goes down while those of other parameters go up.
* **Network Bytes**: The speed of data exchange over the network (bytes per second).
* **Network Packets**: The number of packets exchanged over the network per second.
