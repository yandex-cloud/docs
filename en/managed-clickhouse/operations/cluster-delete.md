   You can query the cluster ID and name with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

   {% include [terraform-delete-mdb-cluster](../../_includes/mdb/terraform-delete-mdb-cluster.md) %}

   {% include [Terraform timeouts](../../_includes/mdb/mch/terraform/timeouts.md) %}

- API

   To delete a cluster, use the [delete](../api-ref/Cluster/delete.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/Delete](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#Delete) gRPC API call and provide the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter.

   To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
