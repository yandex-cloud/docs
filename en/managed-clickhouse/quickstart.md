For the internal MDB service, the [web interface]({{console-link}}) is deployed where you can manually create a database cluster. For more about quotas and the correlation between ABC services and clouds and folders, see [{#T}](../mdb/access.md).

## Access to DB clusters {#access}

The rules for accessing MDB clusters are already given in [Puncher](https://puncher.yandex-team.ru/): from [Yandex server networks](https://puncher.yandex-team.ru/tasks?id=5cb878a6d5626d264a13ff8a) and [for developers](https://puncher.yandex-team.ru/tasks?id=5d0254aad89cb03fee5006d4).

If you need more rules, request access to the `_PGAASINTERNALNETS_` macro. To connect to {{ CH }} hosts, you need access to ports 8443 (HTTPS) and 9440 (native TLS-enabled protocol).

{% include [cli-setup](../_includes/mdb/internal/cli-setup.md) %}

   If you did everything correctly, the list clusters query should now work:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-ch }} cluster list
   ```

{% else %}

To use the service, create a cluster and connect to a DBMS:

1. All you need to create a database cluster is a folder in Yandex.Cloud that you are allowed to access. If you already have a folder in Yandex.Cloud, open the page of that folder in the management console. If there is no folder yet, create one:

    {% include [create-folder](../_includes/create-folder.md) %}

2. You can connect to DB clusters from both inside and outside of the Cloud:

    1. To connect to a DB cluster from inside the Cloud, create a VM in the same network as the DB cluster (based on [Linux](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md) or [Windows](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-windows.md))

    2. To connect to a cluster from the internet, request public access to the hosts when creating the cluster and adding new hosts.

1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a DB cluster.
