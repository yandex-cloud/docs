# Backups

{{ mch-short-name }} provides automatic and manual database backups. Backups take up space in the storage allocated to the cluster. {% if audience != "internal" %} If the total amount of data and backups exceeds the amount of storage, the excess is [billed](../pricing.md). {% endif %}

Backups are automatically created once a day and stored for {{ mch-backup-retention }} days. You can't disable automatic backups or change the retention period.

The backup process start time is set when a cluster is created or updated. The backup will start within half an hour of the specified time. By default, the backup process starts at 22:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

To restore a cluster from a backup, [follow the instructions](../operations/cluster-backups.md).

## Creating backups {#size}

Backups can be made automatically and manually. Regardless of the type, backups are created incrementally:
* When creating another backup, [data parts](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#mergetree-data-storage) are checked for uniqueness.
* If there are identical [data parts](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#mergetree-data-storage) in at least one of the existing backups and they are no older than {{ mch-dedup-retention }} days, they are not duplicated.

Backup data is stored only for the `MergeTree` engine family. For other engines, backups only store table schemas. Learn more about engines in the [documentation for {{ CH }}](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/).

## Storing backups {#storage}

Backups are stored in Yandex internal storage as binary files and are encrypted using [GPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnuPG). Each cluster has its own encryption keys.

All backups (automatic or manual) are stored for {{ mch-backup-retention }} days.

## Checking backups {#verify}

### Checking backup integrity {#integrity}

Backup integrity is checked on synthetic data using integration tests available in the service. For user clusters, backups currently aren't checked.

### Checking backup recovery {#capabilities}

To test the backup feature, [restore a cluster from a backup](../operations/cluster-backups.md) and check the integrity of your data.
