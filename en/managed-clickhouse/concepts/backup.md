# Backups

{{ mch-short-name }} provides automatic and manual database backups.

A backup is automatically created once a day. You can't disable automatic backups or change the retention period.

To restore a cluster from a backup, [follow the instructions](../operations/cluster-backups.md#restore).

## Creating backups {#size}

Backups can be automatic or manual. In both cases, an incremental schema is used:

* When a backup is being created, [data chunks]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#mergetree-data-storage) are checked for uniqueness.
* If there are identical [data chunks]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#mergetree-data-storage) in an existing backup and they are no older than {{ mch-dedup-retention }} days, they are not duplicated. For cold data in [hybrid storage](storage.md#hybrid-storage-features), this period is {{ mch-backup-retention }} days.

Backups are created separately for each individual cluster [shard](./sharding.md). They are also restored by individual shard with the possibility to restore:

* One or more shard backups in an individual cluster.
* The whole cluster by indicating backups of all cluster shards.

Backup data is stored only for the `MergeTree` engine family. For other engines, backups only store table schemas. For more information about engines, see the [{{ CH }} documentation]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/).

A random replica host is used to create a backup. If there is no cluster host data consistency, restoring clusters from backups does not guarantee complete data recovery. For example, this may occur if:

* [The tables are not replicated](replication.md#replicated-tables) on all shard hosts.
* The tables are not replicated and are only hosted on some of the shard hosts.

The backup process start time is set when a cluster is [created](../operations/cluster-create.md) or [updated](../operations/update.md#change-additional-settings). By default, the backup process starts at 22:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). The backup will start within half an hour of the specified time.

Backups are only created on running clusters. If you don't use a {{ mch-short-name }} cluster around the clock, check the [backup start time settings](../operations/update.md#change-additional-settings).

For more information about creating a backup manually, see [{#T}](../operations/cluster-backups.md).

## Storing backups {#storage}

* Backups of data from [local](storage.md) and [network](storage.md) storage devices are stored in a separate {{ objstorage-name }} bucket and do not take up any space in the cluster storage. If there are N free GB of space in the cluster, the first N GB of backups are stored free of charge.

* Backups of cold data from [hybrid storage](storage.md#hybrid-storage-features) are stored in the same {{ objstorage-name }} bucket as the data. The cost for using Object Storage factors in the amount of space used by backups and the volume of data.

    For more information, see the [Pricing policy for {{ mch-short-name }}](../pricing.md#rules-storage).
    {% endif %}
* Backups of cold data from [hybrid storage](storage.md#hybrid-storage-features) only contain increments: the history of changes to data parts for the last {{ mch-backup-retention }} days. Backups of data that hasn't been modified are provided by {{ objstorage-name }}.

* Backups are stored as binary files and encrypted using [GPG]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnuPG){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard){% endif %}. Each cluster has its own encryption keys.

* Automatically created backups of an existing cluster are kept for 7 days whereas those created manually are stored indefinitely. Once you delete a cluster, all its backups are kept for {{ mch-backup-retention }} days.

* {% include [no-quotes-no-limits](../../_includes/mdb/backups/no-quotes-no-limits.md) %}

## Checking backups {#verify}

### Checking backup integrity {#integrity}

Backup integrity is checked on synthetic data using integration tests available in the service.

### Checking backup recovery {#capabilities}

To test the backup feature, [restore a cluster from a backup](../operations/cluster-backups.md) and check the integrity of your data.
