# Storage types

{% if audience != "internal" %}

{{ mch-name }} lets you use network and local storage drives for database clusters. Network storage drives are based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. Local disks are physically located in the database host servers.

{% include [storage-type](../../_includes/mdb/mch/storage-type.md) %}

If you enable the **Hybrid storage** setting when creating or updating a cluster, you'll be able distribute data between cluster storage and [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../../storage/) object storage. For example, you can store frequently used "hot" data in cluster storage and rarely used "cold" data in less expensive and slower object storage. For details, see [{#T}](#hybrid-storage-features).

## Specifics of local SSD storage {#local-storage-features}

Local SSD storage doesn't provide fault tolerance for stored data and affects the overall pricing for the cluster:

* This storage doesn't provide fault tolerance for a single-host cluster: if a local disk fails, the data is permanently lost. Therefore, when creating a new {{ mch-name }} cluster using local storage, a 2-host fault-tolerant configuration is automatically set up.
* You are charged for a cluster with this storage type even if it's stopped. Read more in the [pricing policy](../pricing.md).

## Specifics of non-replicated SSD storage {#network-nrd-storage-features}

{% include [nrd-storage-details](../../_includes/mdb/nrd-storage-details.md) %}

## Hybrid storage {#hybrid-storage-features}

Hybrid storage provides fault tolerance for data storage and allows you to manage data placement for [MergeTree]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://clickhouse.tech/docs/ru/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/){% endif %} tables: the data is placed either in cluster or object storage depending on the storage policy for the tables.

{% note warning %}

Data in tables other than MergeTree tables is stored only in cluster storage.

{% endnote %}

To start using hybrid storage:

1. Create a cluster of the appropriate type. You don't need to configure object storage.

1. Add databases and tables to the cluster. If the default storage policy isn't suitable for some tables, set the appropriate policies for these tables:

   * To set the the policy when creating a table, configure the `storage_policy` setting:

      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE table_with_non_default_policy (
          <table_schema>
      ) ENGINE = MergeTree
      ...
      SETTINGS storage_policy = '<storage policy type>';
      ```

   * To create or update the policy for an existing table, run the request:

      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE table_with_non_default_policy
      MODIFY SETTING storage_policy = '<storage policy type>';
      ```

For an example, see [{#T}](../tutorials/hybrid-storage.md).

### Available storage policies {#storage-policies}

{% note info %}

You can't create new storage policies or update existing ones.

{% endnote %}

A {{ mch-name }} cluster with enabled hybrid storage supports the following storage policies:

* `default`: A cluster automatically manages placement of data depending on the amount of free disk space in cluster storage and table [TTL](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#mergetree-table-ttl) (lifetime) settings.

   If there's less than {{ mch-hs-move-factor }} of free space (fixed `move_factor` setting for the storage policy), some data from the tables with this policy will be moved to object storage.

   If there's enough free space in cluster storage, only the rows with the expired TTL are moved to object storage. This operation allows some data to be moved to object storage before cluster storage becomes full.

   You can configure the moving of expired rows to object storage and set the TTL value when creating a table or later.

* `local`: In tables with this policy, rows are placed only in cluster storage. Data is not transferred between storages.

* `object storage`: In tables with this policy, rows are placed only in object storage. Data is not transferred between storages.

Storage policies don't affect [merge operations]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://clickhouse.com/docs/ru/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/custom-partitioning-key/){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/custom-partitioning-key/){% endif %} for data chunks:

* Merging data chunks in storage (the `prefer_not_to_merge` policy setting) is permitted.
* Doesn't restrict the maximum size of the resulting data chunk (the `max_data_part_size_bytes` value setting), which you may get after merging smaller chunks.

However, you can configure the behavior of these operations using the [ClickHouse settings](./settings-list.md) available in the cluster.

You can view up-to-date policy settings with the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM system.storage_policies;
```

For more information about storage policies and their settings, see the [{{ CH }} documentation]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://clickhouse.com/docs/ru/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#table_engine-mergetree-multiple-volumes){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#table_engine-mergetree-multiple-volumes){% endif %}.

{% else %}

{{ mch-name }} lets you use local storage for database clusters. Local disks are physically located in the database host servers.

When creating a cluster, you can choose between the following storage types:

* Local SSD storage (`local-ssd`): The fastest disks. This storage can be from 10 to 2048 GB in size.
* Standard local disk storage (`local-hdd`): Uses slower but larger disks. Available only for hosts powered by Broadwell or Cascade Lake and with at least eight vCPUs. The `local-hdd` storage has a fixed volume: 10240 GB for Broadwell and 12800 GB for Cascade Lake.
