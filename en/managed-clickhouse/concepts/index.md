# Resource relationships in {{ mch-name }}

The main entity used in {{ mch-name }} is a _database cluster_.

Each cluster consists of one or more _database hosts_, which are virtual machines with DBMS servers deployed on them. Cluster hosts may reside in different availability zones and even different availability regions. You can learn more about {{ yandex-cloud }} availability zones [here](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).

* A cluster consisting of multiple hosts supports automatic failover, as each host can take the cluster's primary replica role.

   When creating such a cluster, choose one of the available options to ensure replication:

   * {{ CK}}:

      The cluster will consist only of {{ CH }} hosts.

   * {{ ZK }}:

      The cluster will consist of {{ CH }} hosts and individual {{ ZK }} hosts.

* A single-host cluster is not fault tolerant.

   You can [add {{ ZK }} hosts](../operations/zk-hosts.md) to this cluster later to enable fault tolerance and replication. This will allow you to add multiple {{ CH }} hosts to the cluster.

{{ CK }} or {{ ZK }} hosts manage replication and query distribution across cluster hosts. To learn more, see [Replication](./replication.md).

When creating a cluster, specify:
* _Host class_: VM template for deploying the cluster hosts. For a list of available host classes and their specs, see [Host classes](instance-types.md).

* _Environment_: Environment where the cluster will be deployed:
   * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
   * `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mch-short-name }} service itself. The prestable environment is updated first with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.

You should also specify the host class when creating a [shard](sharding.md).


A cluster created in a folder can be accessed by all VMs connected to the same cloud network. For more information about networking, see the [{{ vpc-name }} documentation](../../vpc/).
