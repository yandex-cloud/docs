# {{ CH }} settings

For {{ mch-name }} clusters, you can configure settings that relate to {{ CH }}. Some settings are configured [at the cluster level](#dbms-cluster-settings) and some [at the user level](#user-level-settings).

The label next to the setting name lets you determine which interface is used to set the value of this setting: the management console, CLI, API, SQL, or Terraform. The {{ tag-all }} label indicates that all of the above interfaces are supported.

Depending on the selected interface, the same setting is represented in a different way, for example:

- **Geobase uri** in the management console matches:
   - `geobase_uri` in the gRPC API and Terraform.
   - `geobaseUri` in the REST API.
- **Allow DDL** in the management console matches:
   - `allow_ddl` in the CLI, gRPC API, and SQL.
   - `allowDdl` in the REST API.


## Cluster-level settings {#dbms-cluster-settings}

You can use the following settings:

{% include [mch-dbms-settings](../../_includes/mdb/mch-dbms-settings.md) %}

## User-level settings {#user-level-settings}

### Quota settings {#quota-settings}

Quotas let you limit the consumption of {{ CH }} resources for a specified time interval. Quota settings are set for an individual user.

If the user exceeds one of the quota limits, they can't execute new queries until the interval expires.
{{ CH }} displays a message about exceeding the quota and indicates when the next interval starts. At the beginning of the new interval, query execution is permitted and the limit counters are reset.

{{ CH }} also uses quotas to account for resource consumption.
For each user, there is a default quota that takes into account the consumption of all resources per hour, but doesn't impose any restrictions.
Information about the resource consumption level is written to the {{ CH }} server log.

For more information, see the [{{ CH }} documentation]({{ ch.docs }}/operations/quotas/).

You can use the following quota settings:

{% include [mch-quota-user-settings](../../_includes/mdb/mch-quota-user-settings.md) %}

### DBMS settings {#dbms-user-settings}

These settings apply at the individual user level.

You can use the following settings:

{% include [mch-dbms-user-settings](../../_includes/mdb/mch-dbms-user-settings.md) %}

## Custom settings {#custom-settings}

{{ tag-sql }}

You can redefine [custom settings]({{ ch.docs }}/operations/settings/#custom_settings) as variables in the [settings profile]({{ ch.docs }}/operations/access-rights/#settings-profiles-management), session, or request. Working with settings profiles is available if the [user management via SQL](../operations/cluster-users.md#sql-user-management) is enabled for the cluster.

The name of the user setting in {{ mch-name }} must start with a predefined prefix `custom_`. The prefix is fixed, users cannot change it.
