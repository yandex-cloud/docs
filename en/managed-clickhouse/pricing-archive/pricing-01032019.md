# Pricing policy for {{ mch-short-name }} from January 1 to March 1, 2019

## What goes into the cost of using {{ mch-short-name }} {#rules}

The cost of {{ mch-name }} usage is based on:

* Storage type and size (disk space).

* [The host class](../concepts/instance-types.md) selected for the cluster.

* The number of database hosts in clusters (including ZooKeeper hosts for {{ CH }} clusters).

* Settings and number of backups.

* The amount of outgoing traffic.

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### Use of DB hosts {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of the host's operation in accordance with its class. Exact class characteristics are given in [{#T}](../concepts/instance-types.md).

{% note important %}

For every {{ CH }} cluster with 2 or more hosts, {{ CH }} automatically creates 3 ZooKeeper hosts.

{% endnote %}

The minimum billing unit is one hour (for example, the cost of 1.5 hours of operation is the same as the cost of 2 hours of operation). The time when the DBMS host or ZooKeeper cannot perform its main functions is not charged.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

The following is charged:

* Storage allocated for DB clusters.
    * Storage on fast local disks (SSD) can only be ordered for clusters with more than 2 hosts in 100 GB increments.

* Space used by DB backups in excess of the storage specified for the cluster.

    * Backups are stored free of charge as long as the combined size of the DB and all backups is less than the selected storage volume.

    * During an automatic backup, {{ mch-short-name }} doesn't create a new copy, but saves changes to the database compared to the previous copy. This means that storage used by automatic backups increases only in proportion to the volume of changes that are made.

    * The number of hosts in the cluster does not affect the size of the storage and, consequently, that of free backups.

The cost is specified for one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per hour (for example, the cost of storing 1 GB for 1.5 hours is equal to the cost of storage for 2 hours).

### {{ CH }} and ZooKeeper {#prices-clickhouse}

You can choose the host class for {{ CH }} and ZooKeeper hosts (as appropriate for the expected replication load).

For example, let's say you create a {{ CH }} cluster with 3 `s1.micro` class hosts, but didn't specify the class of the ZooKeeper hosts. {{ mch-short-name }} automatically creates 3 `s1.nano` class ZooKeeper hosts.

The hourly price will be calculated using the rates below (with VAT): `3 × ₽5.5119 + 3 × ₽1.7492 = ₽21.78`.
