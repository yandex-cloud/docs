# {{ mpg-name }} pricing policy before February 1, 2020

This is an old version of the policy, valid before February 1, 2020. To learn more about the current {{ mpg-name }} pricing policy, see [Pricing policy](../pricing.md).

## What goes into the cost of using {{ mpg-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mpg-name }} usage cost includes:

* Disk type and storage size.

* [Host class](../concepts/instance-types.md) selected for the cluster.

* Number of DB hosts per cluster.

* Settings and number of backups.

* Amount of outgoing traffic.


{% include [pricing-gb-size](../../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### DB host usage {#rules-hosts-uptime}

Host operation cost is charged per hour based on host class. You can find detailed class specifications in the [Host classes](../concepts/instance-types.md) section.

The minimum billing unit is one hour (for example, the cost of 1.5 hours of operation is the same as the cost of 2 hours of operation). You do not pay for the time when the {{ PG }} host is unable to perform its main functions.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

You pay for the following:

* Storage allocated for DB clusters.

    * You can only order local high-speed storage (`local-ssd`) for clusters with more than three hosts in 100 GB increments.


* Space used by DB backups in excess of the storage amount specified for the cluster.

    * Backups are stored free of charge as long as the combined size of the DB and all backups is smaller than the selected storage size.

    * When performing automatic backups, {{ mpg-short-name }} does not create a new copy but saves the data changed from the previous backup. It means the storage space used by automatic backups only increases in proportion to the volume of changes.

    * The number of hosts in a cluster does not affect the storage size and, consequently, the free volume of backups.

The price covers one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per hour (e.g., storing 1 GB for 1.5 hours costs the same as for 2 hours).


## Prices {#prices}

{% note info %}

As of February 1, 2020, service pricing [changes](pricing-01022020.md#prices): the cost of clusters will be calculated directly based on the computing resources used, not the host class.
