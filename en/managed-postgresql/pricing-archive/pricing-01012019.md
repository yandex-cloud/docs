# Pricing policy for {{ PG }} before January 1, 2019

This is the old version of the policy that was valid before January 1, 2020. For the current {{ mpg-name }} pricing policy, see [{#T}](../pricing.md).

## What goes into the cost of using {{ mpg-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mpg-name }} usage cost is based on:

- Disk type and storage size.
- The [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md) selected for the cluster.
- The number of DB hosts in the cluster.
- Settings and number of backups.
- The amount of outgoing traffic.

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}


### DB host usage {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of the host's operation in accordance with its class. Exact class characteristics are given in [{#T}](../concepts/instance-types.md).

The minimum billing unit is one hour (for example, the cost of 1.5 hours of operation is the same as the cost of 2 hours of operation). You are not charged for time when the {{ PG }} host is not performing its main functions.


### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

The following is charged:

- Storage allocated for DB clusters.
   - Storage on fast local disks (`local-ssd`) can only be ordered for clusters with more than 3 hosts in 100 GB increments.
- Space used by DB backups in excess of the storage amount specified for the cluster.
   - Backups are stored free of charge until the sum of the DB size and that of all backups remains less than the selected storage volume.
   - During an automatic backup, {{ mpg-short-name }} doesn't create a new copy, but saves changes to the database compared to the previous copy. This means that storage used by automatic backups increases only in proportion to the volume of changes that are made.
   - The number of hosts in the cluster doesn't affect the size of the storage and, consequently, of free backups.

The cost is specified for one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per hour (for example, the cost of storing 1 GB for 1.5 hours is equal to the cost of storage for 2 hours).
