# Access management in {{ mpg-name }}


In this section, you'll learn:

* [Which resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

## What resources you can assign roles to {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

To allow access to {{ mpg-name }} service resources (DB clusters and hosts, cluster backups, databases, and their users), assign the user the appropriate roles for the folder or cloud hosting the resources.

## What roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

The diagram shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. For example, the `{{ roles-editor }}` role includes all the permissions of `{{ roles-viewer }}`. A description of each role is given under the diagram.

## Roles required {#required-roles}

To use the service, you need the `editor` [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) or higher to the folder where a cluster is created. The `viewer` role only enables you to view the cluster list.

You can always assign a role with more permissions. For example, assign the `admin` role instead of `editor`.
