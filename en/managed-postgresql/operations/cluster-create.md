# Creating {{ PG }} clusters

{{ PG }} clusters are one or more database hosts that replication can be configured between. Replication is enabled by default in any cluster consisting of more than one host: the master host accepts write requests and duplicates changes on replicas. The transaction is confirmed if the data is written to disk both on the master host and on a certain number of replicas sufficient to [establish a quorum](../concepts/replication.md).

{% note info %}

* The number of hosts you can create together with a {{ PG }} cluster depends on the selected [storage type](../concepts/storage.md#storage-type-selection) and [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md#available-flavors).
* Available storage types [depend](../concepts/storage.md) on the selected [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md#available-flavors).
* If database storage is 95% full, the cluster switches to read-only mode. Plan and increase the required storage size in advance.

{% endnote %}

By default, {{ mpg-short-name }} sets the maximum number of connections to each {{ PG }} cluster host. This maximum cannot be greater than the value of [Max connections](../concepts/settings-list.md#setting-max-connections).

## How to create a {{ PG }} cluster {#create-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a database cluster.
   1. Select **{{ mpg-name }}**.
   1. Click **Create cluster**.
   1. Name the cluster in the **Cluster name** field. The cluster name must be unique within the folder.
   1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you can't change the environment once the cluster is created):
      * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
      * `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mpg-short-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.
   1. Select the DBMS version.

      {% note info %}

      When you select the host class version `12-1c` ({{ PG }} 12 for 1C), consider the number of users in your 1C:Enterprise installation:
      * For 50 or more users connecting at the same time, we recommend using `s2.medium`.
      * For fewer than 50 users, `s2.small` is sufficient.

      {% endnote %}

   1. Select the host class to define the technical specifications of the VMs where the database hosts will be deployed. All available options are listed in [{#T}](../concepts/instance-types.md). When you change the host class for the cluster, the characteristics of all existing hosts change, too.
   1. Under **Storage size**:

      
      * Select the [storage type](../concepts/storage.md).

         {% include [storages-step-settings](../../_includes/mdb/settings-storages.md) %}


      * Select the size to be used for data and backups. For more information about how backups take up storage space, see [{#T}](../concepts/backup.md).

   1. Under **Database**, specify the database attributes:

      * Database name. This name must be unique within the folder and contain only Latin letters, numbers, and underscores.
      * Username of the database owner. This name may only contain Latin letters, numbers, and underscores. By default, the new user is assigned 50 connections to each host in the cluster.
      * User password (from 8 to 128 characters).
      * Locale for sorting and character set locale. These settings define the rules for sorting strings (`LC_COLLATE`) and classifying characters (`LC_CTYPE`). In {{ mpg-name }}, locale settings apply at the individual database level.

         {% include [postgresql-locale](../../_includes/mdb/mpg-locale-settings.md) %}

   1. Under **Network settings**, select the cloud network to host the cluster in and security groups for cluster network traffic. You may also need to [set up security groups](connect.md#configuring-security-groups) to connect to the cluster.

   1. Under **Hosts**, select the parameters for the database hosts created with the cluster. If you open **Advanced settings**, you can choose specific subnets for each host. By default, each host is created in a separate subnet.

      When configuring the host parameters, note that if you selected `local-ssd` or `network-ssd-nonreplicated` under **Storage**, you need to add at least 3 hosts to the cluster.

   1. If necessary, configure additional cluster settings:

      {% include [Additional cluster settings](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/extra-settings-web-console.md) %}

   1. If required, configure [DBMS cluster-level settings](../concepts/settings-list.md#dbms-cluster-settings).

      {% note info %}

      Some {{ PG }} settings [depend on the selected host class or storage size](../concepts/settings-list.md#settings-instance-dependent).

      {% endnote %}

   1. Click **Create cluster**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To create a cluster:

   
   1. Check whether the folder has any subnets for the cluster hosts:

      ```bash
      yc vpc subnet list
      ```

      If there are no subnets in the folder, [create the necessary subnets](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) in {{ vpc-short-name }}.


   1. View a description of the CLI's create cluster command:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-pg }} cluster create --help
      ```

   1. Specify cluster parameters in the create command (the list of supported parameters in the example is not exhaustive):

   
       ```bash
       {{ yc-mdb-pg }} cluster create \
          --name <cluster name> \
          --environment <environment, prestable or production> \
          --network-name <network name> \
          --host zone-id=<availability zone>,subnet-id=<subnet ID> \
          --resource-preset <host class> \
          --user name=<username>,password=<user password> \
          --database name=<database name>,owner=<database owner name> \
          --disk-size <storage size, GB> \
          --disk-type <network-hdd | network-ssd | local-ssd | network-ssd-nonreplicated> \
          --security-group-ids <list of IDs for security groups> \
          --connection-pooling-mode=<connection manager operating mode> \
          --deletion-protection=<cluster deletion protection: true or false> \
          --serverless-access
       ```

       Specify the `subnet-id` if there are 2 or more subnets in the selected availability zone.


       Available [connection pooler modes](../concepts/pooling.md): `SESSION`, `TRANSACTION`, or `STATEMENT`.

       {% include [deletion-protection-limits-db](../../_includes/mdb/deletion-protection-limits-db.md) %}

       You also can specify several more options in the `--host` parameter to manage replication in the cluster:
       * The source of replication for the host in the `replication-source` option to [manage replication streams manually](../concepts/replication.md#replication-manual).
       * The priority of the host in the `priority` option to [affect the master selection process](../concepts/replication.md#selecting-the-master):
         * A host with the highest priority in the cluster becomes a synchronous replica.
         * If the cluster has multiple hosts with the highest priority, the master host is elected from among them.
         * The lowest priority value is `0` (default) and the highest is `100`.

              
       To allow access to the cluster from [{{ sf-full-name }}](../../functions/concepts/index.md), pass the `--serverless-access` parameter. For more information about access setup, see the documentation for [{{ sf-name }}](../../functions/operations/database-connection.md).


- {{ TF }}

   {% include [terraform-definition](../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}
   
   If you don't have {{ TF }}, [install it and configure the provider](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).


   To create a cluster:

   1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:

      * Database cluster: Description of the cluster and its hosts.

      * Database: Description of the cluster's database.

      * User: Description of the cluster user.

## Examples {#examples}

### Creating a single-host cluster {#creating-a-single-host-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   To create a cluster with a single host, pass a single `--host` parameter.

   Create a {{ mpg-name }} cluster with test characteristics:

   
   * Named `mypg`.
   * In the `production` environment.
   * In the `default` network.
   * In the security group `{{ security-group }}`.
   * With one `{{ host-class }}` host in the `b0rcctk2rvtr8efcch64` subnet in the `{{ region-id }}-a` availability zone.
   * With a network SSD storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`) of 20 GB.
   * With one user, `user1`, with the password `user1user1`.
   * With one `db1` database owned by the user `user1`.
   * With protection against accidental cluster deletion.


   Run the following command:

   
   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-pg }} cluster create \
      --name mypg \
      --environment production \
      --network-name default \
      --resource-preset {{ host-class }} \
      --host zone-id={{ region-id }}-a,subnet-id=b0rcctk2rvtr8efcch64 \
      --disk-type {{ disk-type-example }} \
      --disk-size 20 \
      --user name=user1,password=user1user1 \
      --database name=db1,owner=user1 \
      --security-group-ids {{ security-group }} \
      --deletion-protection=true
   ```


- {{ TF }}

   Create a {{ mpg-name }} cluster and a network for it with test characteristics:

   * Named `mypg`.
   * Versions `{{ pg.versions.tf.latest }}`.
   * In the `PRESTABLE` environment.
   * In the cloud with the ID `{{ tf-cloud-id }}`.
   * In the folder with the ID `{{ tf-folder-id }}`.
   * In the new `mynet` network.
   * In the new security group `pgsql-sg` allowing connections to the cluster from the internet via port `6432`.
   * With one `{{ host-class }}` host in the new `mysubnet` subnet and `{{ region-id }}-a` availability zone. The `mysubnet` subnet will have a range of `10.5.0.0/24`.
   * With a network SSD storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`) of 20 GB.
   * With one user, `user1`, with the password `user1user1`.
   * With one `db1` database owned by the user `user1`.
   * With protection against accidental cluster deletion.
