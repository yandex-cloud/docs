# Creating {{ PG }} clusters

{{ PG }} clusters are one or more database hosts that replication can be configured between. Replication is enabled by default in any cluster consisting of more than one host: the master host accepts write requests, then duplicates changes synchronously in the primary replica and asynchronously in all the others.

{% note info %}

If database storage is 95% full, the cluster switches to read-only mode. Plan and increase the required storage size in advance.

{% endnote %}


The number of hosts that can be created together with a {{ PG }} cluster depends on the selected [type of storage](../concepts/storage.md):

* With **local storage**, you can create a cluster with 3 or more hosts (to ensure fault tolerance, a minimum of 3 hosts is necessary).
* When using network storage:
    * If you select **standard** or **fast network storage**, you can add any number of hosts within the [current quota](../concepts/limits.md).
    * If you select **non-replicated network storage**, you can create a cluster with 3 or more hosts (to ensure fault tolerance, a minimum of 3 hosts is necessary).

After creating a cluster, you can add extra hosts to it if there are enough available [folder resources](../concepts/limits.md).

By default, {{ mpg-short-name }} sets the maximum number of connections to each {{ PG }} cluster host. This maximum cannot be greater than the value of [Max connections](../concepts/settings-list.md#setting-max-connections).

## How to create a {{ PG }} cluster {#create-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a database cluster.

  1. Select **{{ mpg-name }}**.

  1. Click **Create cluster**.

  1. Enter a name for the cluster in the **Cluster name** field. The cluster name must be unique within the folder.

  1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you can't change the environment once the cluster is created):
      - `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
      - `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mpg-short-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.

  1. Select the DBMS version.

      {% note info %}

      When you select the host class version `12-1c` ({{ PG }} 12 for 1C), consider the number of users in your 1C:Enterprise installation:
      * For 50 or more users connecting at the same time, we recommend using `s2.medium`.
      * For fewer than 50 users, `s2.small` is sufficient.

      {% endnote %}

  1. Select the host class to define the technical specifications of the VMs where the database hosts will be deployed. All available options are listed in [{#T}](../concepts/instance-types.md). When you change the host class for the cluster, the characteristics of all existing hosts change, too.

  1. Under **Storage size**:


      - Select the type of storage, either a more flexible network type (`network-hdd`, `network-ssd`, or `network-ssd-nonreplicated`) or faster local SSD storage (`local-ssd`). 
    
        When selecting a storage type, remember that:
        - The size of the local storage can only be changed in 100 GB increments.
        - The size of non-replicated network storage can only be changed in 93 GB increments.

      - Select the size to be used for data and backups. For more information about how backups take up storage space, see [{#T}](../concepts/backup.md).

  1. Under **Database**, specify the database attributes:

      - Database name. This name must be unique within the folder and contain only Latin letters, numbers, and underscores.

      - Username of the database owner. This name may only contain Latin letters, numbers, and underscores. By default, the new user is assigned 50 connections to each host in the cluster.

      - User password (from 8 to 128 characters).

      - Locale for sorting and character set locale. These settings define the rules for sorting strings (`LC_COLLATE`) and classifying characters (`LC_CTYPE`). In {{ mpg-name }}, locale settings apply at the individual database level.

           {% include [postgresql-locale](../../_includes/mdb/mpg-locale-settings.md) %}

  1. Under **Network settings**, select the cloud network to host the cluster in and security groups for cluster network traffic. You may need to additionally [set up security groups](connect.md#configuring-security-groups) to connect to the cluster.

  1. Under **Hosts**, select the parameters for the database hosts created with the cluster. If you open the **Advanced settings** section, you can choose specific subnets for each host. By default, each host is created in a separate subnet.

      When configuring the host parameters, note that if you selected `local-ssd` or `network-ssd-nonreplicated` under **Storage**, you need to add at least 3 hosts to the cluster.

  1. If necessary, configure additional cluster settings:

     {% include [mpg-extra-settings](../../_includes/mdb/mpg-extra-settings-web-console.md) %}

  1. If required, configure [DBMS cluster-level settings](../concepts/settings-list.md#dbms-cluster-settings).

     {% note info %}

     Some {{ PG }} settings [depend on the selected host class or storage size](../concepts/settings-list.md#settings-instance-dependent).

     {% endnote %}

  1. Click **Create cluster**.

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  To create a cluster:

  
  1. Check whether the folder has any subnets for the cluster hosts:

     ```
     yc vpc subnet list
     ```

     If there are no subnets in the folder, [create the necessary subnets](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) in {{ vpc-short-name }}.

  1. View a description of the CLI create cluster command:

      ```
      {{ yc-mdb-pg }} cluster create --help
      ```

  1. Specify the cluster parameters in the create command (only some of the supported parameters are given in the example):

  
      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-pg }} cluster create \
         --name <cluster name> \
         --environment <prestable or production> \
         --network-name <network name> \
         --host zone-id=<availability zone>,subnet-id=<subnet ID> \
         --resource-preset <host class> \
         --user name=<username>,password=<user password> \
         --database name=<database name>,owner=<database owner name> \
         --disk-size <storage size, GB> \
         --disk-type <network-hdd | network-ssd | local-ssd | network-ssd-nonreplicated> \
         --security-group-ids <list of security group IDs> \
         --deletion-protection=<protect cluster from deletion: true or false>
      ```
      
      The `subnet-id` should be specified if the selected availability zone contains two or more subnets.

      {% include [deletion-protection-limits-db](../../_includes/mdb/deletion-protection-limits-db.md) %}
      
      You can also specify some additional options in the `--host` parameter to manage replication in the cluster:
      - Replication source for the host in the `replication-source` option to [manually manage replication threads](../concepts/replication.md#replication-manual).
      - Host priority in the `priority` option to [influence the selection of a synchronous replica](../concepts/replication.md#selecting-the-master-and-a-synchronous-replica):
        - The host with the highest priority value in the cluster becomes the synchronous replica.
        - If the cluster has multiple hosts with the highest priority, the synchronous replica is elected from among them.
        - The lowest priority value is `0` (default) and the highest is `100`.

- Terraform

  {% include [terraform-definition](../../_includes/solutions/terraform-definition.md) %}

  If you don't have Terraform, [install it and configure the provider](../../solutions/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

  To create a cluster:

  1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:
     * Database cluster: Description of the cluster and its hosts. If required, here you can also configure [DBMS settings](../concepts/settings-list.md#dbms-cluster-settings).
     * Network: Description of the [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) where the cluster will be located. If you already have a suitable network, you don't need to describe it again.
     * Subnets: Description of the [subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) to connect the cluster hosts to. If you already have suitable subnets, you don't need to describe them again.

     Example configuration file structure:

     ```hcl
     terraform {
       required_providers {
         yandex = {
           source = "yandex-cloud/yandex"

           disk_type_id       = "<storage type>"
           disk_size          = <storage size in GB>
         }
       }
     
       database {
         name = "<database name>"
         owner = "<name of the database owner>"
       }
     
       user {

         password = "<user password>"
         permission {
           database_name = "<database name>"
         }
       }
     
       host {
         zone      = "<availability zone>"
         subnet_id = "<subnet ID>"
       }
     }
     
     resource "yandex_vpc_network" "<network name>" { name = "<network name>" }
     
     resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "<subnet name>" {
       name           = "<subnet name>"
       zone           = "<availability zone>"
       network_id     = "<network ID>"
       v4_cidr_blocks = ["<range>"]
     }
     ```

     {% include [Deletion protection limits](../../_includes/mdb/deletion-protection-limits-db.md) %}

     For more information about the resources you can create using Terraform, see the [provider documentation {{ TF }}]({{ tf-provider-mpg }}).

  1. Make sure the settings are correct.

  1. Create a cluster.

     {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

- API

  Use the API [create](../api-ref/Cluster/create.md) method and pass the following information in the request:
    * In the `folderId` parameter, the ID of the folder where the cluster should be placed.
    * The cluster name, in the `name` parameter.
    * The environment of the cluster, in the `environment` parameter.
    * Network ID, in the `networkId` parameter.
    * Cluster configuration, in the `configSpec` parameter.
    * Configuration of the cluster hosts, in one or more `hostSpecs` parameters.
    * [Security group](../concepts/network.md#security-groups) identifiers, in the `securityGroupIds` parameter.
    * Database configuration, in one or more `databaseSpecs` parameters.
    * User settings, in one or more `userSpecs` parameters.

{% endlist %}

{% note warning %}

If you specified security group IDs when creating a cluster, you may also need to [re-configure security groups](connect.md#configuring-security-groups) to connect to the cluster.

## Examples {#examples}

### Creating a single-host cluster {#creating-a-single-host-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

  To create a cluster with a single host, pass a single `--host` parameter.

  Let's say we need to create a {{ PG }} cluster with the following characteristics:

    - Named `mypg`.
  - In the `production` environment.
  - In the `default` network.
  - In the security group `{{ security-group }}`.
  - With one `{{ host-class }}` class host in the `b0rcctk2rvtr8efcch64` subnet in the `{{ zone-id }}` availability zone.
  - With 20 GB of fast network storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`).
  - With one user (`user1`) with the password `user1user1`.
  - With one `db1` database owned by the user `user1`.
  - With protection against accidental cluster deletion.

  Run the command:

  
  ```bash
  {{ yc-mdb-pg }} cluster create \
    --name mypg \
    --environment production \
    --network-name default \
    --resource-preset {{ host-class }} \
    --host zone-id={{ zone-id }},subnet-id=b0rcctk2rvtr8efcch64 \
    --disk-type {{ disk-type-example }} \
    --disk-size 20 \
    --user name=user1,password=user1user1 \
    --database name=db1,owner=user1 \
    --security-group-ids {{ security-group }} \
    --deletion-protection=true
  ```

- Terraform

  Let's say we need to create a {{ PG }} cluster and a network for it with the following characteristics:
  - Named `mypg`.
  - Version `13`.
  - In the `PRESTABLE` environment.
  - In the cloud with the ID `{{ tf-cloud-id }}`.
  - In the folder with the ID `{{ tf-folder-id }}`.
  - Network: `mynet`.
  - In the new security group `pgsql-sg` allowing connections to the cluster from the internet via port `6432`.
  - With 1 `{{ host-class }}` class host in the new `mysubnet` subnet and `{{ zone-id }}` availability zone. The `mysubnet` subnet will have the range `10.5.0.0/24`.
  - With 20 GB of fast network storage (`{{ disk-type-example }}`).
  - With one user (`user1`) with the password `user1user1`.
  - With one `db1` database owned by the user `user1`.
  - With protection against accidental cluster deletion.

  The configuration file for the cluster looks like this:
