# Assigning privileges and roles to {{ PG }} users

Atomic permissions in **{{ PG }}** are called _privileges_ and permission groups are called _roles_. For more information about access permissions, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/user-manag.html).

The user created with a **{{ mpg-name }}** cluster is the owner of the first database in the cluster. You can [create other users](cluster-users.md#adduser) and configure their permissions as you wish:

- [Updating the list of user roles](#grant-role).
- [Granting a privilege to a user](#grant-privilege).
- [Revoking a privilege from a user](#revoke-privilege).

{% include [public-privilege](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/public-privilege.md) %}

## Updating the list of user roles {#grant-role}

To assign a role to a user, use the {{ yandex-cloud }} interfaces: the roles assigned by the `GRANT` query are canceled during the next database operation.

With {{ mpg-name }}, you cannot access [predefined](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/predefined-roles.html) roles, including the superuser role. The highest privileges for working with clusters are granted to users with the `mdb_admin` [role](../concepts/roles.md#mdb-admin). For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/roles.md).

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mpg-name }}**.
   1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and select the **Users** tab.
   1. In the line with the name of the desired user, click ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **Configure**.
   1. Expand the **DBMS settings** list and select the roles you want to assign to the user in the **Grants** field.
   1. Click **Save**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To assign roles to a cluster user, pass the list of required roles in the `--grants` parameter. This completely overwrites existing roles: if you want to extend or reduce the available list, first request the current roles with user information by running the `{{ yc-mdb-pg }} user get` command.

   To assign roles, run the command:

   ```
   {{ yc-mdb-pg }} user update <username> \
          --grants=<role1,role2> \
          --cluster-id <cluster ID>
   ```

   You can query the cluster name with the [list of clusters](cluster-list.md) in the folder and the username with the [list of users](cluster-users.md#list-users).

- {{ TF }}

   To assign roles to a cluster user:

   1. Open the current {{ TF }} configuration file with an infrastructure plan.

      For more information about creating this file, see [{#T}](cluster-create.md).

      For a complete list of available {{ mpg-name }} cluster user configuration fields, see the [{{ TF }} provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/mdb_postgresql_user).

   1. Find the `yandex_mdb_postgresql_user` resource of the desired user.
   1. Add an attribute named `grants` with a list of required roles:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_mdb_postgresql_user" "<username>" {
        ...
        name   = "<username>"
        grants = [ "<role1>","<role2>" ]
        ...
      }
      ```

   1. Make sure the settings are correct.

      {% include [terraform-validate](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/validate.md) %}

   1. Confirm the resources have been updated.

      {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

- API

   To specify a new list of the required user roles, use the [update](../api-ref/User/update.md) REST API method for the [User](../api-ref/User/index.md) resource or the [UserService/Update](../api-ref/grpc/user_service.md#Update) gRPC API call and provide the following in the request:

   * Cluster ID in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](./cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
   * Username in the `userName` parameter.
   * List of new user roles in the `grants` parameter.

      This completely overwrites the existing roles: if you want to extend or reduce the available list, first request the current roles with user information via the [get](../api-ref/User/get.md) method.

   * List of user configuration fields to update (`grants` in this case) in the `updateMask` parameter.

   {% include [Note API updateMask](../../_includes/note-api-updatemask.md) %}

{% endlist %}

## Granting a privilege to a user {#grant-privilege}

1. [Connect](connect.md) to the database under the database owner's account.
2. Run the `GRANT` command. For a detailed description of the command syntax, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html).


## Revoking a privilege from a user {#revoke-privilege}

1. [Connect](connect.md) to the database under the database owner's account.
2. Run the `REVOKE` command. For a detailed description of the command syntax, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-revoke.html).
