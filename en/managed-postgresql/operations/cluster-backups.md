description: "You can back up and restore clusters from your existing PostgreSQL backups. Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) technology allows you to restore the state of the cluster to any point in time from the backup to the current moment."

# Managing backups

You can create [backups](../concepts/backup.md) and restore clusters from existing backups.

## Restoring clusters from backups {#restore}

Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) technology lets you restore the cluster state to any point in time in the interval from creating the oldest full backup to archiving the most recent write ahead log (WAL). For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/backup.md).

For example, if the backup operation ended August 10, 2020, 12:00:00 UTC, the current date is August 15, 2020, 19:00:00 UTC, and the latest write ahead log was saved August 15, 2020, 18:50:00 UTC, the cluster can be restored to any state between August 10, 2020, 12:00:01 UTC and August 15, 2020, 18:50:00 UTC inclusive.

When you restore a cluster from a backup, you create a new cluster with data from the backup. If the folder has insufficient [resources](../concepts/limits.md) to create such a cluster, you will not be able to restore from the backup. The average backup recovery speed is 10 MBps per database core.

When creating a new cluster, set all required parameters.

When restoring to the current state, the new cluster will reflect the state of:

* An existing cluster at the time of recovery.
* A deleted cluster at the time of archiving the last write ahead log.

   To restore an existing cluster from a backup:
   1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mpg-name }}**.
   1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and select the tab **Backup copies**.
   1. Click the ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) icon for the desired backup and click **Restore cluster**.
   1. Set up the new cluster. You can select a folder for the new cluster from the **Folder** list.
   1. To restore the cluster state from a desired point of time after creating this backup, configure the **Date and time of recovery (UTC) setting**. You can enter the value manually or select it from the drop-down calendar.

      If you don't change the setting, the cluster is restored to the state when the backup was completed.
   1. Click **Restore cluster**.

   To restore a previously deleted cluster from a backup:
   1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mpg-name }}**.
   1. Click the **Backups** tab.
   1. Find the desired backup using the backup creation time and cluster ID. The **Name** column contains the IDs in `<cluster ID>:<backup ID>` format.
   1. Click the ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) icon for the desired backup and click **Restore cluster**.
   1. Set up the new cluster. You can select a folder for the new cluster from the **Folder** list.
   1. To restore the cluster state from a desired point of time after creating this backup, configure the **Date and time of recovery (UTC) setting**. You can enter the value manually or select it from the drop-down calendar.

      If you don't change the setting, the cluster is restored to the state when the backup was completed.
   1. Click **Restore cluster**.

   {{ mpg-name }} launches the operation to create a cluster from the backup.

   To restore a cluster from a backup:

   1. View a description of the CLI restore {{ PG }} cluster command:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-pg }} cluster restore --help
      ```

   1. Getting a list of available {{ PG }} cluster backups:

      ```

      ```text

      ```

      The time when the backup was completed is shown in the `CREATED AT` column with a list of available backups, in `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss` format (`2020-08-10 12:00:00` in the example above). You can restore a cluster to any point in time starting with creation of its backup.

   1. Request the creation of a cluster from a backup:

      

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-pg }} cluster restore \
         --backup-id=<backup ID> \

      * `--time`: Point in time to which you need to restore a {{ PG }} cluster's state, in `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ` format.
      * `--name`: The cluster name.
      * `--environment`: Environment:

         * `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ PG }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.

         * `subnet-name`: [Name of the subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet). It must be specified if the selected availability zone includes two or more subnets.
         * `assign-public-ip`: Flag to specify if a host requires a [public IP address](../../vpc/concepts/address.md#public-addresses).

- {{ TF }}

   Use {{ TF }} to restore:

   * An existing cluster from a backup.
   * A cluster created and deleted via the management console, CLI, or API.

   To restore a cluster, you'll need the backup ID. Retrieve a list of available {{ PG }} cluster backups [using the CLI](#list-backups):

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-pg }} backup list
   ```

   ```text
   +--------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+---------------------+
   |            ID            |      CREATED AT     |  SOURCE CLUSTER ID   |      STARTED AT     |

   ```

   {% include [Terraform timeouts](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/terraform/timeouts.md) %}

   **To restore an existing cluster from a backup:**

   1. Create a [{{ TF }} configuration file](cluster-create.md#create-cluster) for the new cluster.

      Don't use resources of the databases (`yandex_mdb_postgresql_database`) and users (`yandex_mdb_postgresql_user`). They will be restored from the backup.

   1. Add a block named `restore` to the configuration file:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_mdb_postgresql_cluster" "<cluster name>" {
        ...
        restore {
          backup_id = "<desired backup name>"
          time      = "<restore time stamp in yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss format>"
        }
      }
      ```

      In the `time` parameter, specify the point in time to which you want to restore the {{ PG }} cluster, starting from when the selected backup was created.

      {% note info %}

      If you don't specify the `time` parameter, the cluster is restored to the state when the backup was completed.

      {% endnote %}

   1. Make sure the settings are correct.

      {% include [terraform-validate](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/validate.md) %}

   1. Confirm the update of resources.

      {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

   {{ TF }} will create a copy of the existing cluster. The databases and users are deployed from the selected backup.

   **To restore a previously deleted cluster from a backup:**

   1. Create a [{{ TF }} configuration file](cluster-create.md#create-cluster) for the new cluster.

      Don't use resources of the databases (`yandex_mdb_postgresql_database`) and users (`yandex_mdb_postgresql_user`). They will be restored from the backup.

   1. In the configuration file, add a `restore` block with the name of the backup to restore the cluster from:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_mdb_postgresql_cluster" "<cluster name>" {
        ...
        restore {
            backup_id = "<remote cluster backup ID>"
        }
      }
      ```

   1. Make sure the settings are correct.

      {% include [terraform-validate](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/validate.md) %}

   1. Confirm the update of resources.

      {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

   {{ TF }} will create the new cluster. The databases and users are deployed from the backup.

- API

   Use the [restore](../api-ref/Cluster/restore.md) API method and pass the following in the request:

   * ID of the desired backup, in the `backupId` parameter. To find out the ID, [retrieve a list of cluster backups](#list-backups).
   * The timestamp of the point to which you want to recover the cluster, in the `time` parameter.
   * The name of the new cluster that will contain the data recovered from the backup, in the `name` parameter. The cluster name must be unique within the folder.

- CLI

   To set the backup start time, use the `-- backup-window-`start flag. Time is given in `HH:MM:SS` format.

      --disk-size <storage size, GB>
      --backup-window-start 10:00:00
   ```

   To change the backup start time in an existing cluster, use the `update` command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-pg }} cluster update \
      --cluster-name <cluster name> \
      --backup-window-start 11:25:00
