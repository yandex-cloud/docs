# Monitoring the state of clusters and hosts

## Monitoring cluster status {#monitoring-cluster}

To view detailed information about the {{ mpg-name }} cluster status:

1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mpg-name }}**.

1. Click on the name of the cluster and open the **Monitoring** tab.

1. {% include [open-in-yandex-monitoring](../../_includes/mdb/open-in-yandex-monitoring.md) %}

The following charts open on the page:

* **Age of oldest transaction/statement**: Oldest transaction processing and operator execution time.
* **Average transaction/statement time**: Average transaction processing and operator execution time.
* **CPU usage**: Usage of processor cores.
* **Disk read/write bytes**: Disk read and write speed (bytes per second).
* **Disk read/write IOPS**: Disk read and write activity (ops per second).
* **Disk usage by DB**: Disk usage by database (bytes).
* **Disk usage on primary**: Disk usage on a master host (bytes).
* **Inode usage by host**: The used number of inodes by host.
* **Inode usage on primary**: The used number of inodes on a master host.
* **Is primary, [boolean]**: Indicates which host is the master and for how long.
* **Free space**: Free disk space for each host (in bytes).
* **Log errors**: Number of logged errors per second.
* **Memory usage**: The use of RAM in bytes. At high loads, the value of the **Free** parameter goes down while those of other parameters go up.
* **Network Bytes**: Network data transfer speed (bytes per second).
* **Packets received/sent**: Network packet transmission activity (packets per second).
* **Pooler is alive, [boolean]**: Pooler health for each host either as a master or as a replica.
* **PostgreSQL alive, [boolean]**: PostgreSQL health for each host either as a master or as a replica.
* **Replication lag**: Replication delay.
* **Session CPU usage cores**: Number of utilized processor cores by session type.
* **Sessions per wait event**: Number of waiting sessions by wait type.
* **Sessions read bytes**: Amount of data read by session type (bytes).
* **Sessions write bytes**: Amount of data written by session type (bytes).
* **Statement quantiles**: Operator execution time by percentile.
* **TCP connections**: Number of TCP connections per second.
* **Total pooler connections**: Number of pooler connections, both client and server.
* **Total size of temporary files**: Total temporary file size (bytes).
* **Total size of WAL files**: Total [WAL file](../concepts/backup.md) size (bytes).
* **Transaction quantiles**: Transaction processing time by percentile.
* **Transactions/statements per second**: Number of transactions and operators per second.

## Monitoring the state of hosts {#monitoring-hosts}

To view detailed information about the status of individual {{ mpg-name }} hosts:

1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mpg-name }}**.
1. Click the name of the desired cluster and select **Hosts** → **Monitoring**.
1. Select the host from the drop-down list.

This page displays charts showing the load on an individual host in the cluster:

* **CPU usage**: Usage of processor cores. As the load goes up, the **Idle** value goes down.
* **Disk IOPS**: The number of disk operations per second.
* **Disk read/write bytes**: The speed of disk operations (bytes per second).
* **Memory usage**: The use of RAM in bytes. At high loads, the value of the **Free** parameter goes down while those of other parameters go up.
* **Network Bytes**: The speed of data exchange over the network (bytes per second).
* **Network Packets**: The number of packets exchanged over the network per second.

The **Disk read/write bytes** and the **Disk IOPS** charts show that the **Read** property increases when active database reads are in progress, and that **Write** increases when database writes are in progress.

For hosts with the **Replica** role, it's normal that **Received** is greater than **Sent** on the **Network Bytes** and **Network Packets** charts.


## Alert settings in {{ monitoring-full-name }} {#monitoring-integration}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder with the cluster you wish to configure alerts for.
   1. In the list of services, select ![image](../../_assets/monitoring.svg) **{{ monitoring-short-name }}**.
   1. Under **Service dashboards**, select:
      * **{{ mpg-name }} — Cluster Overview **to configure cluster alerts.
      * **{{ mpg-name }} — Host Overview **to configure host alerts.
   1. In the desired chart, click ![options](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **Create alert**.
   1. If there are multiple metrics on a chart, select a data query to generate a metric and click **Continue**. For more information about the query language, see the [{{ monitoring-full-name }} documentation](../../monitoring/concepts/querying.md).
   1. Set the `Alarm` and `Warning` threshold values to trigger the alert.
   1. Click **Create alert**.

{% endlist %}

{% include [other-indicators](../../_includes/mdb/other-indicators.md) %}

Recommended threshold values:

| Metric | Parameter | `Alarm` | `Warning` |
|---------------------------------------|:--------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Replication delay | `postgres-replication_lag` | `60` | `5`   |
| Number of healthy hosts | `postgres-is_alive` | `<number of hosts> - 2` | `<number of hosts> - 1` |
| Average query execution time | `pooler-avg_query_time` | — | `2000` |
| Storage space used | `disk.used_bytes` | 90% of storage size | 80% of storage size |

You can view the current storage size in [detailed information about the cluster](cluster-list.md#get-cluster).

For a complete list of supported metrics, see the [{{ monitoring-name }} documentation](../../monitoring/metrics-ref/index.md#managed-postgresql).


## Cluster state and status {#cluster-health-and-status}

{% include [health-and-status](../../_includes/mdb/monitoring-cluster-health-and-status.md) %}

To view a cluster's state and status:

1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mpg-name }}**.
1. Hover over the indicator in the **Availability** column in the row of the cluster you need.

### Cluster states {#cluster-health}

{% include [monitoring-cluster-health](../../_includes/mdb/monitoring-cluster-health.md) %}

### Cluster statuses {#cluster-status}
