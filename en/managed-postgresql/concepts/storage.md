# Storage in {{ mpg-name }}

{% if audience != "internal" %}

{{ mpg-name }} lets you use network and local storage drives for database clusters. Network storage drives are based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. Local disks are physically located in the database host servers.

{% include [storage-type-nrd](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/storage-type.md) %}

## Specifics of local SSD storage {#local-storage-features}

Local SSD storage doesn't provide fault tolerance for stored data and affects the overall pricing for the cluster:

* This storage doesn't provide fault tolerance for a single-host cluster: if a local disk fails, the data is permanently lost. Therefore, when creating a new {{ mpg-name }} cluster using local storage, a 3-host fault-tolerant configuration is automatically set up.
* You are charged for a cluster with this storage type even if it's stopped. Read more in the [pricing policy](../pricing.md).

## Specifics of non-replicated SSD storage {#network-nrd-storage-features}

{% include [nrd-storage-details](../../_includes/mdb/nrd-storage-details.md) %}

## Choice of storage type during cluster creation {#storage-type-selection}

The number of hosts that can be created with a {{ PG }} cluster depends on the storage type selected:

* With local SSD (`local-ssd`) or non-replicated SSD (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`) storage, you can create a cluster with three or more hosts (to ensure fault tolerance, a minimum of three hosts is necessary).
* With `network-hdd` or `network-ssd` storage, you can add any number of hosts within the [current quota](./limits.md).

For more information about limits on the number of hosts per cluster, see [{#T}](./limits.md).

{% else %}

{{ mpg-name }} lets you use local storage for database clusters. Local disks are physically located in the database host servers.

When creating a cluster, you can choose between the following storage types:

* Local SSD storage (`local-ssd`): The fastest disks. This storage capacity is between 10 and 2048 GB.
* Standard local disk storage (`local-hdd`): Uses slower but larger disks. Available only for hosts powered by Broadwell or Cascade Lake and with at least eight vCPUs. `local-hdd` storage has a fixed volume: 10240 GB for Broadwell and 12800 GB for Cascade Lake.

{% endif %}

## Managing disk space {#manage-storage-space}

When the storage is more than 95% full, the host automatically switches to read-only mode. At the same time, the `DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_READ_ONLY = TRUE` setting is set for all the DBs via the `ALTER DATABASE` query.

In this mode, the data `INSERT`, `DELETE`, or `UPDATE` queries result in an error.

### Monitoring the switch to read-only mode {#read-only-monitor}

To monitor storage usage on cluster hosts, configure alerts in {{ monitoring-full-name }}:

1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ monitoring-name }}**.
1. Select **{{ mpg-name }}**.
1. [Create a notification channel](../../monitoring/operations/alert/create-channel.md
   ).
1. [Create an alert](../../monitoring/operations/alert/create-alert.md) with the following properties:

   1. **Metric**: Set the metric parameters:

      * Cloud
      * Folder
      * **{{ mpg-name }}** service
      * {{ mpg-name }} cluster ID

         You can get the cluster ID [with a list of clusters in a folder](../operations/cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

      * `disk.free_bytes` label

   1. **Trigger condition**: Set the `Less than or equal` to condition for the size of free disk space to trigger the alert:

      * 95% of the storage size for `Alarm`.
      * 90% of the storage size for `Warning`.

   1. **Additional settings**:

      * **Aggregation function**: `Minimum` (a metric's minimum value for the period).
      * **Calculation window**: Desired period to update a metric's value.

   1. Add the previously created notification channel.

{% endif %}

### Disabling a cluster in read-only mode {#read-only-solutions}

If the cluster switched to read-only mode:

* [Increase the storage capacity](../operations/update.md#change-disk-size) to go above the threshold value. After that, {{ yandex-cloud }} disables read-only mode automatically.

* Manually disable read-only mode and free up storage space by deleting some of the data.

   {% note alert %}

   Make sure the amount of free disk space never reaches zero during this time. Since the fail-safe is disabled, {{ PG }} will crash and the cluster will be disabled.

   {% endnote %}

To disable read-only mode manually, contact [technical support]({{ link-console-support }}) or follow the instructions below:

1. [Connect to the database](../operations/connect.md) however is convenient.

1. Open the transaction and run the following command inside it:

   ```sql
   SET LOCAL transaction_read_only TO off;
   ```

1. As part of the same transaction, delete unnecessary data using the `DROP` or `TRUNCATE` operators. Don't use the `DELETE` operator: it marks rows as deleted, but does not physically delete them from the database.

1. Commit the transaction and restart all connections to the database.

> For example, if your database contains the unnecessary table `ExcessDataTable1`, delete it with a transaction:
>
> ```sql
> BEGIN;
> SET LOCAL transaction_read_only TO off;
> DROP TABLE ExcessDataTable1;
> COMMIT;
> ```
