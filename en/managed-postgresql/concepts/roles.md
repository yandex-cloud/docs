# Assigning {{ PG }} roles

With {{ mpg-name }}, you cannot access [predefined](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/predefined-roles.html) roles, including the superuser role. Instead, this service provides you with the following special roles:

* `mdb_admin`: For users who are not database owners but need administrative privileges.
* `mdb_monitor`: For users who need to read various configuration parameters, statistics, and other system information.
* `mdb_replication`: For users who need access to logical replication.

To assign a user a role, [use](../operations/grant.md) the {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI or API; the roles assigned by a `GRANT` request are revoked when the next database operation is performed.
