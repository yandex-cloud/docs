description: "The main entity operated by the Managed Service for PostgreSQL is a database cluster. Each cluster consists of one or more database hosts - virtual machines with deployed DBMS servers. Cluster hosts can be located in different availability zones. A cluster of several hosts automatically fault tolerant - one of the replica hosts will take over the role of master if the current master host fails."

# Relationship between service resources

The main entity used in {{ mpg-name }} is a _database cluster_.

Each cluster consists of one or more _database hosts_, which are virtual machines with DBMS servers deployed on them. Cluster hosts may reside in different availability zones. [More about the geo scope of {{ yandex-cloud }}](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).

* A cluster with multiple hosts features automatic failover: one of the replica hosts becomes the master if the current master host is down.

  A replica that explicitly specifies the source of the replication thread can't take the master role. For more information, see [{#T}](replication.md).

* A single-host cluster is cheaper, but it doesn't guarantee fault tolerance.

When creating a cluster, specify:

* _Host class_: A VM template for deploying the cluster hosts. For a list of available host classes and their characteristics, see [{#T}](instance-types.md).

* _Environment_: The environment where the cluster will be deployed:
   * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
   * `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mpg-short-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.

 A database cluster created in a folder can be accessed by all VMs connected to the same cloud network. [Learn more about networking](../../vpc/).
