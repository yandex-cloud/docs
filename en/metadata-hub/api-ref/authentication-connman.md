# {{ metadata-hub-full-name }} API authentication


Before you can work with the API, you need to get an [IAM token](../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md):

* [Guide](../../iam/operations/iam-token/create.md) for Yandex accounts.
* [Guide](../../iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-sa.md) for service accounts.
* [Guide](../../iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-federation.md) for federated accounts.
