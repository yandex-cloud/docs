# Updating a backup policy

## Changing basic settings {#update-basic-parameters}

To change the basic settings of a [backup policy](../../concepts/policy.md):

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you want to change the policy.
   1. In the list of services, select **{{ backup-name }}**.
   1. Go to the ![policies](../../../_assets/backup/policies.svg) **Backup policies** tab.
   1. Next to the policy you wish to change, click ![options](../../../_assets/options.svg) and select **Edit**.
   1. Edit the policy parameters:

      {% include [policy-options](../../../_includes/backup/policy-options.md) %}

   1. Click **Save**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View a description of the update backup policy CLI command:

      ```bash
      yc backup policy update --help
      ```

   1. Specify a backup policy configuration in JSON format.

      {% cut "Sample configuration file" %}

      {% include [json-example](../../../_includes/backup/operations/json-example.md) %}

      {% endcut %}

      The example describes a configuration for a backup policy that will create [incremental](../../concepts/backup.md#types) VM backups every Monday at 00:05 (UTC+0). Only the last 10 backups will be stored.

      See also [Full backup policy specification](../../concepts/policy.md#specification).

   1. Get the ID of the backup policy to update:

      {% include [get-policy-id](../../../_includes/backup/operations/get-policy-id.md) %}

   1. Update the backup policy by specifying its ID:

      ```bash
      yc backup policy update <policy_ID> \
        --settings-from-file <configuration_file_path>
      ```

      Where `--settings-from-file` is the path to the backup policy configuration file in JSON format.

      Result:

      ```bash

## Updating a VM list {#update-vm-list}

To update the list of VMs whose backups are created under the current backup policy:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the policy is located.
   1. In the list of services, select **{{ backup-name }}**.
   1. Go to the ![policies](../../../_assets/backup/policies.svg) **Backup policies** tab.
   1. Select the policy for which to update the list of VMs.
   1. Update the list of VMs:

      * To add a new VM, click ![image](../../../_assets/plus-sign.svg) **Attach VM** under **Virtual machines**. In the window that opens, choose the VM to link to the policy and click **Save**.
      * To remove a VM, under **virtual machines**, click ![options](../../../_assets/options.svg) next to the VM to be unlinked from the policy and select **Detach from policy**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. Get the ID of the policy for which to update the list of VMs:

      {% include [get-policy-id](../../../_includes/backup/operations/get-policy-id.md) %}

   1. Get the IDs of VMs to add or delete:

      {% include [get-vm-id](../../../_includes/backup/operations/get-vm-id.md) %}

   1. Edit the list of VMs included in the backup policy:

      * To link a VM to a backup policy:

         View a description of the CLI command:

         ```bash
         yc backup policy apply --help
         ```

         Link your VMs to the backup policy by specifying their IDs:

         ```bash
         yc backup policy apply <policy_ID> \
           --instance-ids <VM_IDs>
         ```

         Where `--instance-ids` are the IDs of VMs to be linked to the backup policy. Multiple IDs should be comma-separated.

         For more information about the command, see the [CLI reference](../../../cli/cli-ref/managed-services/backup/policy/apply.md).

      * To unlink a VM from a backup policy:

         View a description of the CLI command:

         ```bash
         yc backup policy revoke --help
         ```

         Unlink your VMs from the backup policy by specifying their IDs:

         ```bash
         yc backup policy revoke <policy_ID> \
           --instance-ids <VM_IDs>
         ```

         Where `--instance-ids` are the IDs of VMs to be unlinked from the backup policy. Multiple IDs should be comma-separated.
