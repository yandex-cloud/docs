# Backup policies

Backups of {{ yandex-cloud }} resources are created in {{ backup-name }} automatically according to _backup policies_.

The backup policy specifies:

* Backup frequency: By hour, day, week, or month. The time is provided for the [UTC](https://{{ lang }}.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTCÂ±00:00) time zone.
* Backup type: Full or incremental. For more information, see [{#T}](backup.md#types).
* [Snapshot retention](#retention) settings.

{% note info %}

Backups can be created with a little delay from the schedule, depending on the current load on the service.

{% endnote %}

## Storing backups {#retention}

You can set up backup storage for the policy. The following can be stored for each VM included in the policy:

* All backups created under this policy.
* Only the last several backups.
* Only the snapshots younger than a certain age, e.g., those created during the last few days.

The settings apply to all VMs in the policy.

## Backup policy specification {#specification}

In {{ backup-name }}, you can [create](../operations/policy-vm/create.md) or [update](../operations/policy-vm/update.md) backup policies based on the specification in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format using the {{ yandex-cloud }} [command line](../../cli/quickstart.md).
