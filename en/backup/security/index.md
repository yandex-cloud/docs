## What resources you can assign roles to {#resources}

Using the {{ yandex-cloud }} console or the YC CLI, you can assign a role to a {% if audience != "internal" %}[cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud){% else %}cloud{% endif %} or {% if audience != "internal" %}[folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder){% else %}folder{% endif %}. These assigned roles will also apply to nested resources.
