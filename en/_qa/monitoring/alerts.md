#### How can I reduce the number of false alerts? {#reduce-false-alerts}

You can increase the [evaluation window](../../monitoring/concepts/alerting.md#evaluation-window) or change the [aggregation function](../../monitoring/concepts/alerting.md#aggregation) in the [alert](../../monitoring/concepts/alerting.md#alert) parameters.

#### What value should I specify in a threshold? {#threshold-values}

The threshold value is set in the units of the selected metric.

For example, the value of a database cluster's free disk space threshold is specified in bytes. It is convenient to set a threshold by moving the slider on the chart with real data. Make sure the threshold value for a **Warning** does not exceed that for an **Alarm**.

#### How do I set an alert recipient? {#alert-recipient}

In the [notification channel](../../monitoring/concepts/alerting.md#channel-parameters), the following methods are supported:
* Email
* Text message (SMS)
* Push notifications in the {{ yandex-cloud }} [mobile app](../../overview/mobile-app/index.md).

{% include [account-info](../../_includes/monitoring/account-info.md) %}

#### A user does not receive any alerts. Why is that? {#alert-receive-failed}

Check the mailbox and phone number settings in the user's account [notification channel](../../monitoring/concepts/alerting.md#channel-parameters).
