# Metric collection and export

#### How do I add a VM's RAM metric? {#add-metrics-ram}

The {{ compute-full-name }} service can't measure vRAM consumption inside the guest operating system because for the service, memory consumption by the virtual machine is always the same: the one that is allocated the moment it is started.

You can configure collecting custom metrics yourself [via the API](../../monitoring/operations/metric/add.md), and for Linux-compatible operating systems using the [agent for delivering system metrics](../../monitoring/operations/unified-agent/linux_metrics.md). The agent lets you collect statistics on the use of most system resources: CPU, RAM, network, and disk.


#### How do I add a VM's disk space metric? {#add-metrics-space}

{{ monitoring-name }} can't access guest operating systems, so there is no such metric.

You can configure collecting custom metrics yourself [via the API](../../monitoring/operations/metric/add.md), and for Linux-compatible operating systems using the [agent for delivering system metrics](../../monitoring/operations/unified-agent/linux_metrics.md). The agent lets you collect statistics on the use of most system resources: CPU, RAM, network, and disk.


#### How do I collect custom metrics from my app? {#collect-1st-party}

[{{ unified-agent-full-name }}](../../monitoring/operations/unified-agent/pull_prometheus.md) supports metric collection in the {{ prometheus-name }} format and metric conversion to the {{ monitoring-name }} format. That means you can use {{ unified-agent-short-name }} to collect metrics from any application that provides them in the {{ prometheus-name }} format.

Use a [client library](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/) for the programming language your application is written in and deliver metrics to {{ monitoring-name }} in {{ prometheus-name }} format.

#### How do I deliver third-party app metrics to {{ monitoring-name }}? {#collect-3rd-party}

To deliver metrics from third-party applications to {{ monitoring-name }}, use {{ unified-agent-full-name }} with the `metrics_pull` input configured. {{ unified-agent-full-name }} periodically polls the third-party application directly (if the application supports metrics in the {{ prometheus-name }} format) or polls a special export application that integrates with {{ prometheus-name }}.

You can find an example for how to configure delivery of HAProxy metrics in [{#T}](../../monitoring/operations/unified-agent/haproxy.md).

#### How do I deliver metrics from hosts outside {{ yandex-cloud }}? {#collect-external}

Configure [authorized keys of service accounts](../../monitoring/operations/unified-agent/non-yc.md) to deliver metrics to {{ monitoring-name }} through {{ unified-agent-full-name }}.

You can also use this method to send metrics from {{ yandex-cloud }} VMs without a linked service account.


#### How do I view a list of metrics? {#metrics-list}

To do this, open **Metric Explorer** and select the desired service.

To get a complete list of metrics belonging to a specific cloud and folder, follow the [instructions on how to make API requests](../../monitoring/operations/metric/list.md).


#### Can I export metrics in {{ prometheus-name }} format? {#export-prometheus}

To export metrics in {{ prometheus-name }} format, use the [prometheusMetrics](../../monitoring/api-ref/MetricsData/prometheusMetrics.md) method.

See an example of how to set up metric export in the [documentation](../../monitoring/operations/metric/prometheusExport.md).
