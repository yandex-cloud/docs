# Partner bonus program

#### What is a partner bonus? {#bonus}

A partner bonus is a discount on {{ yandex-cloud }} services that is applied to the payment invoice issued to the {{ yandex-cloud }} partner's billing account at month-end. The certificate, payment invoice, and invoice issued to the partner indicate the final amount including the discount.

#### What determines the discount amount, the way it is credited, and how it is calculated? {#discount}

The discount amount depends on the total monthly consumption of {{ yandex-cloud }} services by all [sub-accounts](start-grant.md#sub-account) linked to the partner's billing account.

You can link a customer's sub-account to your partner account in the [partner portal](https://partners.cloud.yandex.ru/). Linking a sub-account is grounds for crediting a bonus. It's displayed in the partner portal, in the partner's {{ yandex-cloud }} management console, and in the linked customer's management console.

The partner discount is not shown to the linked sub-accounts in the management console. {{ yandex-cloud }} does not issue separate payment invoices to sub-accounts.

For more information about the discount amount, see the [Partner Agreement]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_grant/?lang=ru){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_grant/?lang=en){% endif %}.

#### What is not included when calculating a partner bonus? {#no-bonus}

The discount doesn't apply to:
* The service usage amount in the partner account.
* Grants credited to sub-accounts.
* Resources from {{ yandex-cloud }} {{ marketplace-name }}.

You can see the absolute and relative discount amount for the reporting month in the **Rewards** section of the partner portal.

#### Why are resources from {{ yandex-cloud }} {{ marketplace-name }} not included when calculating a partner bonus? {#marketplace}

{{ yandex-cloud }} sells {{ marketplace-name }} services with a minimum margin or with no margin at all. Therefore, we can't provide an additional discount on solutions from {{ marketplace-name }} images.
