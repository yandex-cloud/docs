# Initial grant

#### What is the initial grant? {#start-grant}

The initial grant lets you get hands-on experience using {{ yandex-cloud }} without paying for the resources that you use. It's given automatically when creating the first billing account for a partner or customer after their billing account is verified. The amount of the initial grant for businesses is RUB 4000. Read more about the grant system in [Grant](../../billing/concepts/bonus-account.md).

#### How do I get the initial grant for an activated partner account? {#connected-accounts}

The initial grant is provided when the first billing account is activated. You can't get the initial grant for any previously activated accounts. If necessary, use [{#T}](additional-grants.md).

#### How do I activate the initial grant for new partner accounts? {#new-accounts}

When you create your first billing account as a partner, the initial grant is given automatically. You can't get the initial grant for additional billing accounts. If necessary, use [{#T}](additional-grants.md).

#### How do I get the initial grant when I connect a customer under the partner program and create a sub-account? {#client connection}

The initial grant is only provided when the customer's first and main billing account is created. It is not available for sub-accounts. If necessary, use [{#T}](additional-grants.md).

#### What is a sub-account? {#sub-account}

A sub-account is an additional account for a customer's billing account. It's created automatically when you link your customer's account to your partner account in the partner portal. It's displayed both in your {{ yandex-cloud }} account's management console and the customer's management console.
