# General questions

#### I cannot log in to the partner portal. What should I do? {#login}

If you received a welcome email saying that you joined the program with a link to the [partner portal]({{ link-cloud-partners }}) and you cannot log in:
1. Make sure you are logged in with the Yandex ID that your billing account with the partner status is linked to.
1. Check that your billing account is activated and its status is `Active`.
   This status confirms that the paid version has been activated and there are no arrears for resource usage.
1. If necessary, top up your account. The minimum payment amount is shown at the time of payment in the **Top up account** window.

#### How do I contact the {{ yandex-cloud }} partner program team? {#contacts}

You can ask questions about grants or how to use {{ yandex-cloud }} via the [support service]({{ link-console-support }}) in the {{ yandex-cloud }} console. The support team will call in the partner program team if necessary.

You can ask questions about the terms of the program or share your opinion at [yc-partners@yandex-team.ru](mailto:Yc-partners@yandex-team.ru) or in the partner chat.

#### How do I connect to the Telegram chat for {{ yandex-cloud }} partners? {#tg-chat}

Send a list of employees in `Full Name — Position — Telegram username` format and your company's billing account to [yc-partners@yandex-team.ru](mailto:Yc-partners@yandex-team.ru).
