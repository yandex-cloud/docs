### How do I create a logarithmic scale on a line chart? {#make-logarithmic-scale}

To select the axis type:
1. Go to the chart.
1. Make sure that all fields in the **X** axis section have the **Fractional number** type.
1. Open the **X** axis settings.
1. In the **Axis type** field, select **Logarithmic**.

If you select the **Logarithmic** axis type and then change the data type to **Integer** or add fields with a different data type, the axis type won't change.

To select the **Linear** axis type again, change all the fields in the axis section to fractional numbers, then select the **Logarithmic** axis type, and revert to the desired data types.
