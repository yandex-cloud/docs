### How to enable or disable materialization? {#materialization-on-off}

You can disable materialization (switch to direct access to the data source) for all connection types except CSV.

You can select the [mode of data source access](../../datalens/concepts/dataset/settings.md#mode) in the dataset settings. Go to the [Materialization](../../datalens/operations/dataset/materialize.md) settings and select:

* **Direct access** to disable materialization.
* **One-time materialization** or **Periodic materialization** to enable one of the materialization options.
