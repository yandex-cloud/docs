### Do you support the {{ PG }} GEO type? {#postgre-type}

{{ datalens-short-name }} does not support data types of the [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/docs/) extension that is used in {{ PG }} to work with geodata. [`Geopoint`](../../datalens/concepts/data-types.md#geopoint) and [`Geopolygon`](../../datalens/concepts/data-types.md#geopolygon) are string types of certain formats.
