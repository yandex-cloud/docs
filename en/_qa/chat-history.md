#### Can I see my chat history? {#chat-history}

You can only view the history of the chats you had in [{{ ai-playground }}]({{ link-console-main }}/link/ai-studio/). To do this:

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder your chat was in.
1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.dashboard.DashboardPage.AiStudioSection.section_title_1sDGx }}**.
1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.yagpt.foundation-models.section_title.playground }}**, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.yagpt.foundation-models.playground.text-generation.title }}**.

On the left side of the screen you will see all the experiments available to you.
