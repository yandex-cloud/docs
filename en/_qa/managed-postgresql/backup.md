# Moving and restoring a {{ PG }} cluster

#### Can I restore a cluster backup to a running {{ mpg-short-name }} instance on a different cloud network? {#diff-network}

You can only recover a cluster from a backup within a single cloud network.

To migrate data between cloud networks, follow the [migration instructions](../../managed-postgresql/tutorials/replication-overview.md).

#### Do I need the wal2json plugin if there is only data replication and no copying? {#wal2json}

Yes, you need the plugin even if you do not copy data.

#### Can I make a local dump of a database backup? {#backup-local-dump}

You cannot use the service to make a local dump of a DB backup from {{ yandex-cloud }} but you can use the [pg_dump utility](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/app-pgdump.html).

#### How do I move a local {{ PG }} database dump to {{ yandex-cloud }}? {#dump-to-yc}

Follow the instructions in [Migrating databases](../../managed-postgresql/tutorials/data-migration.md).

#### How do I import data to a {{ PG }} database cluster in {{ mpg-short-name }}? {#migrate}

Use the `pg_dump` built-in tool to migrate data to a {{ PG }} cluster in {{ mpg-short-name }}.

#### Why can a data transfer through creating and restoring a logical dump fail with an error? {#backup-error}

[Restoring a logical dump](../../managed-postgresql/tutorials/data-migration.md#backup) may fail with one of the following errors:

* `ERROR:  role "<source username>" does not exist`
* `ERROR:  must be member of role "<source username>"`

The errors occur because the target cluster does not have the user (or the privileges of the user) who created the logical dump in the source cluster.

To resolve the errors:

1. In the target cluster, [add a user](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-users.md#adduser) with access to the migrated database and the same name as the user who created the logical dump in the source cluster.
1. Use this user to [restore the logical dump](../../managed-postgresql/tutorials/data-migration.md#restore) or [grant their privileges](../../managed-postgresql/operations/grant.md#grant-privilege) to the user who is restoring the logical dump.
