# Questions about the billing account

#### How do I get the billing account ID? {#account-id}

To get a billing account's ID:

{% include [billing-account-id](../../_includes/billing/billing-account-id.md) %}

#### How many billing accounts can I create? {#account-amount}

{% include [billing-account-amounts](../../billing/_includes/billing-account-amounts.md) %}

{% include [billing-account-payers](../../billing/_includes/billing-account-payers.md) %}

{% include [billing-account-payers-example](../../billing/_includes/billing-account-payers-example.md) %}

#### How many clouds can I link to my billing account? {#clouds-amount}

{% include [pin-cloud-note](../../billing/_includes/pin-cloud-note.md) %}

#### How do I transfer a cloud to a different billing account? {#cloud-transfer}

To transfer your cloud to a different billing account, just [link](../../billing/operations/pin-cloud.md) it to this account. This automatically unlinks the cloud from its current account. To avoid entering into arrears, top up the personal account in the billing account that the cloud was transferred from.

#### I created a new billing account, but it's blocked. Why? {#blocked-account}

Most likely, you had previously created a billing account for which a trial period was activated. Your billing account gets the initial grant as part of the trial period. As the initial grant can be issued to one billing account only, you cannot use the trial period after re-registration. As a result, your new billing account gets the `SUSPENDED` status.
To unblock your new billing account, [activate the paid version](../../billing/operations/activate-commercial.md) and [top up your personal account](../../billing/operations/pay-the-bill.md) by the minimum amount (the minimum amount is shown in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.dashboard.button_refill }}** window).

#### How do I change my billing account type? {#account-type}

You cannot change a billing account type once it is created, but you can [create a new one](../../billing/operations/create-new-account.md).

#### How do I enable a billing threshold? {#credit}

[Billing threshold](../../billing/concepts/billing-threshold.md) is enabled automatically after the [paid version is activated](../../billing/operations/activate-commercial.md) and the first reporting period ends.


{% include [change-payment-method](../../billing/_includes/change-payment-method.md) %}


#### How can I change my payment details or the delivery address? {#change-email}

{% include [change-address](../../billing/_includes/change-address.md) %}


#### I received no email with instructions on what to do after creating a billing account with the {{ ui-key.yacloud_billing_account.cloud-billing-account.payment-type_label_invoice }} payment method. Why? {#account-notification}

It may take up to three business days to activate your billing account.
If no email arrived within that period, send a request to: [cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru](mailto:cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru).

{% include [change-payment-docs](../../billing/_includes/change-payment-docs.md) %}


#### I can't link a bank card when creating a billing account. What should I do? {#cant-create}

The service most likely doesn't support the payment system of your bank card.

To resolve the issue, try linking a different bank card or, if you are a business owner, create a billing account with the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.create-new.account-type_label_company }}** type and **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.create-new.payment-type_label_invoice }}** payment method.

#### Why do I get the error "The country is not available to the payer" when creating a billing account? {#account-error}

Most likely you have logged in under a Yandex account already linked to a payer with a different residence status.

{% include [billing-account-payers](../../billing/_includes/billing-account-payers.md) %}

To create a billing account with a payer being a resident of a different country, log in using a different Yandex ID or under a different YandexÂ 360 account.

{% include [billing-account-payers-example](../../billing/_includes/billing-account-payers-example.md) %}

#### How do I change the billing account owner? {#account-owner}

You cannot change the billing account owner. If you still need this, a new owner may [create a billing account](../../billing/operations/create-new-account.md) and [link](../../billing/operations/pin-cloud.md) clouds with all their resources to this billing account.
