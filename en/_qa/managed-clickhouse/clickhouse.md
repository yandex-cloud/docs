# Questions about {{ CH }}

#### Why should I use {{ CH }} in {{ mch-short-name }} rather than my own VM-based installation? {#clickhouse-advantages-vm}

{{ mch-short-name }} automates routine database maintenance:

* Quick DB deployment with the necessary available resources.

* Data backup.

* Regular software updates.

* Providing DB cluster failover.

* Database usage monitoring and statistics.

#### When should I use {{ CH }} instead of {{ PG }}? {#clickhouse-advantages-pg}

{{ CH }} only supports adding and reading data because it is designed primarily for  (OLAP). In other cases, it's probably more convenient to use {{ PG }}.

#### How do I upload data to {{ CH }}? {#load-data}

Use the `INSERT` statement described in the [{{ CH }} documentation]({{ ch.docs }}/sql-reference/statements/insert-into/).

#### How do I upload very large data to {{ CH }}? {#loadalot}

Use the [CLI]({{ ch.docs }}/interfaces/cli/) for efficient data compression during transmission (the recommended frequency is no more than one `INSERT` command per second).

Data transfer from physical media is not yet supported.

#### What happens to a cluster if one of its nodes fails? {#node-out}

DB clusters consist of at least two replicas, so the cluster will continue working if one of its nodes is out.

Data may be lost only if a node with a [non-replicated table]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replication/) fails.

#### Is it possible to deploy a {{ CH }} database cluster in multiple availability zones? {#multiple-az}

Yes, you can. A database cluster may consist of hosts that reside in different availability zones and even different availability regions.

#### How does replication work for {{ CH }}? {#zookeeper-access}

{{ mch-short-name }} clusters use replication using {{ CK }} or {{ ZK }}. In the first case, no additional settings are required â€” replication and fault tolerance are enabled by default. In the second case, for each {{ CH }} cluster, a {{ ZK }} cluster with at least three hosts is created.

Access to {{ ZK }} and its setup are not available to {{ yandex-cloud }} users.

#### Why does a {{ CH }} cluster take up 3 hosts more than it should? {#why-does-a-cluster-take-up-3-hosts-more-than-it-should}

When creating a {{ CH }} cluster with 2 or more hosts, {{ mch-short-name }} automatically creates a cluster with 3 {{ ZK }} hosts to manage replication and fault tolerance, if {{ CK }} support is not enabled. These hosts are taken into account when calculating the consumed cloud [resource quota]({{ link-console-quotas }}) and cluster cost. By default, {{ ZK }} hosts are created with a minimal [host class](../../managed-clickhouse/concepts/instance-types.md).

For more information about using {{ ZK }}, see the [ClickHouse documentation]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replication).

#### How do I delete data in {{ CH }} based on TTL? {#how-ttl-data-processing-works}

Data is deleted based on [TTL]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#mergetree-table-ttl) either in entire [data chunks]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#table_engine-mergetree-multiple-volumes) or in merge transactions rather than row by row.

Deleting entire data chunks is more efficient and uses less server resources but requires the value of the TTL expression and the [partitioning key]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/custom-partitioning-key/) to be the same or at least of the same order of magnitude for all TTL data chunk rows.

Deletions during merge transactions use more resources and are carried out with regular background merge transactions or during unscheduled merges. Merge frequency depends on the value in the `merge_with_ttl_timeout` parameter. This parameter is set at table [creation]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#table_engine-mergetree-creating-a-table) and is equal to the minimum time in seconds before a repeat merge to process data with an expired TTL. The default is 14400 seconds (4 hours).

We recommend managing TTL data processing always to delete obsolete data in entire chunks. To do this, set [ttl_only_drop_parts]({{ ch.docs }}/operations/settings/settings/#ttl_only_drop_parts) to `true` when creating tables.

#### Can I use JSON data for tables in {{ CH }}? {#how-to-use-json}

Yes, you can. However, JSON is currently an experimental data type in {{ CH }}. To allow creating tables of this type, run this query:

```sql
SET allow_experimental_object_type=1;
```

{% note info %}

`SET` queries are [not supported](../../managed-clickhouse/operations/web-sql-query#query-restrictions-in-the-management-console) when connecting to a cluster through the management console. To run such a query, use a different cluster connection method, e.g., [through clickhouse-client](../../managed-clickhouse/operations/connect#clickhouse-client).

Make sure you have the latest client version installed.

{% endnote %}

For more information, see the [{{ CH }} documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/guides/developer/working-with-json/json-semi-structured/#json-object-type).

#### Why is a cluster working slowly even though it still has free computing resources? {#throttling}

{% include [throttling](../throttling.md) %}

To increase the maximum IOPS and bandwidth values and make throttling less likely, increase the storage size when you [update your cluster](../../managed-clickhouse/operations/update.md#change-disk-size).

If you are using the `network-hdd` storage type, consider switching to `network-ssd` or `network-ssd-nonreplicated` by [restoring the cluster](../../managed-clickhouse/operations/cluster-backups.md#restore) from a backup.
