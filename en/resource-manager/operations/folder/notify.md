# Folder incident notifications

Users specified under **Incident notifications** in the folder settings are notified of incidents in specific folders of the cloud. The _folder_ owners don't receive any notifications by default. They should subscribe to notifications themselves.

To add a user to the list of notification recipients:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. Select the folder to set up. If necessary, [switch to another cloud](../cloud/switch-cloud.md).

  1. Go to the **Incident notifications** tab.

  1. Click **Add**.

  1. Select the user you want to notify of incidents.

     {% note info %}

     You can add users with a [Yandex account](../../../iam/concepts/index.md#passport) and [federated users](../../../iam/concepts/index.md#saml-federation). Federated users should specify their email address in their account settings.

     {% endnote %}

{% endlist %}
