# Updating a folder

The management console only allows you to change the name of a folder. To change its description, use the CLI or API.

{% list tabs %}

- Management console
  1. Select the folder on the [Home page]({{ link-console-main }}) of the management console. This page displays folders for the selected cloud. If necessary, [switch to another cloud](../cloud/switch-cloud.md).
  2. Click ![image](../../../_assets/options.svg) next to the folder and select **Rename**.
  3. Enter a new name for the folder.
  4. Click **Rename**.

- CLI

  1. See the description of the update folder command:

      ```
      yc resource-manager folder update --help
      ```

  2. If you know the folder ID or name, proceed to the next step. If not, use one of these methods to get them:

      * Get a list of folders:

          ```
          $ yc resource-manager folder list
          +----------------------+--------------------+--------+--------+-------------+
          |          ID          |        NAME        | LABELS | STATUS | DESCRIPTION |
          +----------------------+--------------------+--------+--------+-------------+
          | b1gppulhhm2aaufq9eug | yet-another-folder |        | ACTIVE |             |
          | b1gvmob95yysaplct532 | default            |        | ACTIVE |             |
          +----------------------+--------------------+--------+--------+-------------+
          ```

      * If you know the ID of the resource that belongs to the required folder, you can get the folder ID from the information about that resource:

          ```
          yc <SERVICE-NAME> <RESOURCE> get <RESOURCE-ID>
          ```

          where:
          * `<SERVICE-NAME>` is the name of the service, such as `compute`.
          * `<RESOURCE>` is the category of the resource, such as `instance`.
          * `<RESOURCE-ID>` is the resource ID.

          For example, the `fhmp74bfis2aim728p2a` VM belongs to the `b1gpvjd9ir42nsng55ck` folder:

          ```
          yc compute instance get fhmp74bfis2ais728p2a
          id: fhmp74bfis2ais728p2a
          folder_id: b1gpvjd9ia42nsng55ck
          ...
          ```

  3. Change the folder parameters, such as name and description. You can specify the folder to update by its name or ID.

      ```
      yc resource-manager folder update default \
          --new-name myfolder \
          --description "this is my default-folder"
      ```

      The command will rename the `default` folder to `myfolder` and update its description.

      {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

- API

  To update the folder, use the [update](../../api-ref/Folder/update.md) method for the [Folder](../../api-ref/Folder/index.md) resource.
