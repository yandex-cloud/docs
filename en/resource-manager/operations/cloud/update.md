# Rename a cloud

To rename a cloud, you must have the [`editor`](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#editor) role or higher for that cloud. You can't rename a suspended cloud. If you can't perform this operation, contact the [administrator](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#admin) or [cloud owner](../../concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#owner).
