# Supported languages and language models

All text language models support Russian and English.

## English-Russian model {#engrus}

This model works best, but supports only two languages:

* `en` — English
* `ru` — Russian

{% note important %}

Currently, this model can't be selected with [automatic language detection](../../operations/ocr/text-detection.md#basic). To use this model, you need to [overtly specify](../../operations/ocr/text-detection.md#multiple-languages) one or both languages.

{% endnote %}
