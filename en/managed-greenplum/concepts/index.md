# Relationships between service resources

The main entity used in {{ mgp-name }} is a _database cluster_.

Each cluster consists of database hosts, which are virtual machines with DBMS servers deployed on them. A {{ mgp-name }} cluster contains:

* Two _master hosts_.
* Two or more _segment hosts_.

The _primary_ master host (PRIMARY) accepts client connections and SQL queries and distributes them to segment hosts for processing.

The _standby_ master host (STANDBY) continuously replicates the primary one's data but accepts no user connections.

If the primary master fails, the standby takes over. This way, a cluster with two master hosts continues to handle queries if a single master fails.

Standalone DBMS (_segments_) are deployed on segment hosts. They store data fragments and perform most operations for handling queries. Each cluster segment has one replica, a mirror segment that is located on another host and stores a copy of the data from the main segment.

All the hosts of a {{ mgp-name }} cluster are located in a single availability zone: `{{ region-id }}-a` or `{{ region-id }}-b`. You cannot create hosts in zone `{{ region-id }}-c`.{% if audience != "internal" %} For more information, see [{#T}](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) and [{#T}](../../overview/concepts/ru-central1-c-deprecation.md).{% endif %}

{% endif %}

VMs corresponding to cluster hosts can be hosted:

* On {{ yandex-cloud }} _standard hosts_.

   These are physical servers for hosting cluster VMs. They are randomly selected from a pool of available hosts that meet the selected cluster configuration.

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" and audience != "internal" %}

* On {{ yandex-cloud }} _dedicated hosts_.

   These are physical servers that only host your VMs. VMs on dedicated hosts have all the features of regular VMs plus they're physically isolated from other users' VMs.

   Dedicated hosts are selected from _dedicated host groups_ specified when creating a cluster.

   For more information, see [{#T}](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md).

When creating a cluster, specify:

* _Host class_: Template for deploying cluster hosts. For a list of available classes and their characteristics, see [{#T}](instance-types.md).

* _Environment_: The environment where the cluster will be deployed:
   * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
   * `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mgp-short-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.
