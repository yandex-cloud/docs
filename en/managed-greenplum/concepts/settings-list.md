# {{ GP }} settings

For {{ mgp-name }} clusters, you can configure settings that relate to {{ GP }}.

The label next to the setting name lets you determine which interface is used to set the value of this setting: the management console, CLI, API, SQL, or Terraform. The {{ tag-all }} label indicates that all of the above interfaces are supported.

Depending on the selected interface, the same setting is represented differently. For example, **Max connections** in the management console corresponds to:

* `max_connections` in the gRPC API.
* `maxConnections` in the REST API.
