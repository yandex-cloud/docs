# Types of data storage in {{ GP }}

{{ GP }} enables you to use two [types of table data storage](https://docs.greenplum.org/6-16/admin_guide/ddl/ddl-storage.html):

* _Without clustered indexes_ (heap storage).

   This type of table supports _row-oriented_ data storage only. They are best suited for online transaction processing (OLTP), when table data is often modified by `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.

   All tables created in {{ GP }} use this data storage type by default.

* _Append-optimized storage_.

   Tables of this type support both _row_ and _column_-oriented storage. They are good for {% if lang == "ru" and audience != "internal" %}[analytical processing](../../glossary/data-analytics.md){% else %}analytical processing{% endif %} of large data arrays (OLAP), when data is loaded in large batches and accessed by read-only queries. `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations are not allowed on append-optimized tables in {{ GP }}.

   Column-oriented data storage reduces read and write overhead significantly when a query only accesses a small number of columns from the entire table field set. Column-oriented tables also compress better.

   When working with {{ GP }}, we recommend using column-oriented tables with standard compression of level 1 as an analytical DBMS.

## Creating column-oriented tables {#create-columnar-table}

To create a column-oriented table that supports compression, pass the parameters responsible for the appropriate settings in the `CREATE TABLE` command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tableName (...)
WITH (
    appendonly = true,
    orientation = column,
    compresstype = zstd,
    compresslevel = 1
);
```
