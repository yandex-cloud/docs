# Auxiliary utilities

Greenplum Database 6 features [some useful utilities](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Greenplum/6/greenplum-database/client_tool_guides-tools-ref.html) for working with {{ GP }} databases. In particular:

* [gpfdist](https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/6-9/utility_guide/ref/gpfdist.html): Utility to read data from and write data to files located on remote servers. For more information, see [{#T}](./external-tables.md#gpfdist).
* [gpload](https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/6-9/utility_guide/ref/gpload.html): Utility to run jobs described in a YAML control file.
* [psql](https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/6-9/utility_guide/ref/psql.html): Command line interface for working with {{ GP }}.

To install Greenplum Database 6 on your PC or VM running Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 22.04:

1. Download deb packages required to install Greenplum Database 6 from a {{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket using the script below:

   {% list tabs %}

   - Ubuntu 20.04

        ```bash
        curl storage.yandexcloud.net/greenplum-focal-packages/install.sh| sudo bash
        ```

        To view the list of downloadable deb packages, download the [script file](http://storage.yandexcloud.net/greenplum-focal-packages/install.sh).

   - Ubuntu 22.04

        ```bash
        curl storage.yandexcloud.net/greenplum-jammy-packages/install.sh | sudo bash
        ```

      To view the list of downloadable deb packages, download the [script file](http://storage.yandexcloud.net/greenplum-jammy-packages/install.sh).

   {% endlist %}

1. Install the packages you downloaded:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && \
   sudo apt install /tmp/gp-packages/*.deb
   ```

1. Delete the temporary files:

   ```bash
   rm -rf /tmp/gp/packages
   ```

1. Add the following environment variable to `~/.bashrc`:

   ```bash
   echo "export GPHOME=/opt/greenplum-db-6" >> ~/.bashrc && \
   echo "source \$GPHOME/greenplum_path.sh" >> ~/.bashrc && \
   source ~/.bashrc && \
   echo $GPHOME
   ```

   The list of packages in the `install.sh` file includes dependencies for the Python 2 interpreter required to work with Greenplum Database 6. Since Ubuntu 20.04 or higher uses Python 3 by default, set up switching between Python versions in the system.

1. Add `python2` and `python3` to the list of Python alternatives:

   ```bash
   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2 1 && \
        update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 2
   ```

1. Switch the active interpreter version:

   {% note warning %}

   This may impact running other software using Python 3 in the system.

   {% endnote %}

   ```bash
   sudo update-alternatives --config python
   ```

   Enter the number of the line corresponding to `python2` and press **Enter**.

   Make sure Python 2 is the active version now:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   To return to using the Python 3 interpreter later, rerun the `sudo update-alternatives --config python` command and select `python3`.

1. Test the utilities:

   ```bash
   gpload --version && \
   gpfdist --version && \
   psql --version
   ```

You can find installation guides for other utilities on the [VMware website](https://greenplum.docs.pivotal.io/6-19/client_tool_guides/installing.html).
