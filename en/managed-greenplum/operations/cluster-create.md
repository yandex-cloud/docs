# Creating {{ GP }} clusters

A {{ mgp-name }} cluster consists of master hosts that accept client requests and segment hosts that provide data processing and storage.

Available disk types [depend](../concepts/storage.md) on the selected [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md).

For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/index.md).

## How to create a {{ mgp-name }} cluster {#create-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you wish to create a database cluster.
   1. Select **{{ mgp-name }}**.
   1. Click **Create cluster**.
   1. Enter a name for the cluster. It must be unique within the folder.
   1. (Optional) Enter a cluster description.
   1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you cannot change the environment once the cluster is created):
      * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
      * `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mgp-full-name }} service itself. The Prestable environment is first updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.
   1. Select the {{ GP }} version.

   
   1. (Optional) Select groups of [dedicated hosts](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md) to host the cluster on.

      {% include [Dedicated hosts note](../../_includes/mdb/mgp/note-dedicated-hosts.md) %}

   1. Under **Network settings**:
      * Select the cloud network for the cluster.
      * In the **Security groups** parameter, specify the [security group](../operations/connect.md#configuring-security-groups) that contains the rules allowing all incoming and outgoing traffic over any protocol from any IP address.

         {% include [security-groups-note](../../_includes/vpc/security-groups-note-services.md) %}

         {% note alert %}

         For a {{ mgp-name }} cluster to work properly, at least one of its security groups must have rules allowing all incoming and outgoing traffic from any IP address.

         {% endnote %}


       * Select the availability zone and subnet for the cluster. To create a new subnet, click **Create new** subnet next to the availability zone.
       * Select **Public access** to allow connecting to the cluster from the internet.

   1. Specify the administrative user's settings. This is a special user that is needed to manage clusters and cannot be deleted. For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/cluster-users.md).

      * **Username** may contain Latin letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, and may not start with a hyphen. It may be up to 32 characters long.

         {% note info %}

         Such names as `admin`, `gpadmin`, `mdb_admin`, `mdb_replication`, `monitor`, `none`, `postgres`, `public`, `repl` are reserved for {{ mgp-name }}. You cannot create users with these names.

         {% endnote %}

      * **Password** must be between 8 and 128 characters.

   1. Configure additional cluster settings, if required:

      ```

- {{ TF }}

      {% include [terraform-definition](../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}

   To create a cluster:

   1. Using the command line, navigate to the folder that will contain the {{ TF }} configuration files with an infrastructure plan. Create the directory if it does not exist.

   
   1. If you do not have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and create a configuration file with provider settings](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   2. Create a configuration file describing the [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) and [subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).

      The cluster is hosted on a cloud network. If you already have a suitable network, you do not need to describe it again.

      Cluster hosts are located on subnets of the selected cloud network. If you already have suitable subnets, you do not need to describe them again.

      Example structure of a configuration file that describes a cloud network with a single subnet:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_vpc_network" "<network name in {{ TF }}>" { name = "<network name>" }

      resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "<subnet name in {{ TF }}>" {
        name           = "<subnet name>"
        zone           = "<availability zone>"
        network_id     = yandex_vpc_network.<network name in {{ TF }}>.id
        v4_cidr_blocks = ["<subnet>"]
      }
      ```


   1. Create a configuration file with a description of the cluster and its hosts.

      Example of the configuration file structure:

      
      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_mdb_greenplum_cluster" "<cluster name in {{ TF }}>" {
        name                = "<cluster name>"
        environment         = "<environment>"
        network_id          = yandex_vpc_network.<network name in {{ TF }}>.id
        zone                = "<availability zone>"
        subnet_id           = yandex_vpc_subnet.<subnet name in {{ TF }}>.id
        assign_public_ip    = <getting a public IP: true or false>
        deletion_protection = <cluster deletion protection: true or false>
        version             = "<{{ GP }} version>"
        master_host_count   = <number of master hosts: 1 or 2>
        segment_host_count  = <number of segment hosts: from 2 to 32>
        segment_in_host     = <number of segments per host>

        master_subcluster {
          resources {
            resource_preset_id = "<host class>"
            disk_size          = <storage size, GB>
            disk_type_id       = "<disk type>"
          }
        }

        segment_subcluster {
          resources {
            resource_preset_id = "<host class>"
            disk_size          = <storage size, GB>
            disk_type_id       = "<disk type>"
          }
        }

        user_name     = "<username>"
        user_password = "<password>"

        security_group_ids = ["<list of security group IDs>"]
      }
      ```


      Cluster deletion protection will not prevent a manual connection to delete the contents of a database.

      For more information about the resources you can create with {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-mgp }}).

   1. Check the {{ TF }} configuration files for errors:

      {% include [terraform-validate](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/validate.md) %}

   1. Create a cluster:

      {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

      {% include [explore-resources](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/explore-resources.md) %}
