# Monitoring the state of a cluster and hosts

Using monitoring tools in the management console, you can track the status of a {{ mgp-name }} cluster and its individual hosts. These tools display diagnostic information in the form of charts.

{% include [monitoring-provides](../../_includes/mdb/monitoring-provides.md) %}

New data for charts is received every {{ graph-update }}.

## Monitoring cluster status {#monitoring-cluster}

To view detailed information about the {{ mgp-name }} cluster status:

1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mgp-name }}**.
1. Click on the name of the cluster and open the **Monitoring** tab.

The page displays the following charts:

* **Alive hosts**: cluster host functionality.

* **Alive segments**: primary and backup master as well as primary and mirror segment functionality.

* **Connections**: number of DB connections in each state:

    * **Active**: active.
    * **Waiting**: waiting.
    * **Idle**: idle.
    * **Idle in transaction**: idle in a transaction.
    * **Aborted**: terminated.

* **Group resource cpu**: processor core workload by process group:

    * **admin_group**: in the administrative group.
    * **default_group**: in the default group.

* **Group resource memory**: bytes of RAM used by process group:

    * **admin_group**: in the administrative group.
    * **default_group**: in the default group.

* **Master**: definition of primary master host.

* **Master replication lag**: master replication delay (in bytes).

* **Master replication state**: master replication condition.

* **Segment health**: number of segments with various levels of performance:

    * **total**: everything.
    * **not sync**: unsynced.
    * **down**: unavailable.
    * **not prefer role**: non-preferred.

* **Spill files count**: number of temporary files.

* **Spill files size**: total size of temporary files (in bytes).

* **Xid wraparound**: utilization of the [sequence of transaction IDs](https://docs.greenplum.org/6-16/admin_guide/managing/maintain.html) (as a percentage).

## Monitoring the state of hosts {#monitoring-hosts}

To view detailed information about the status of individual {{ mgp-name }} hosts:

1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mgp-name }}**.
1. Click the name of the desired cluster and select **Hosts** â†’ **Monitoring**.
1. Select the host from the drop-down list.

This page displays graphs showing the workload of an individual cluster host (master or segment):

* **CPU**: The load on processor cores. As the load goes up, the **Idle** value goes down.
* **Disk IOPS in progress**: number of pending disk operations.
* **Disk io time**: duration of disk operations.
* **Disk read and write**: amount of data (in bytes) in disk operations.
* **Disk read and write time**: duration of disk reads and writes.
* **Disk usage**: disk space usage (two graphs are displayed: bytes and percent).
* **Memory usage**: The use of RAM in bytes. At high loads, the value of the Free parameter goes down while those of other parameters go up.
* **Network**: amount of network traffic (in bytes).
