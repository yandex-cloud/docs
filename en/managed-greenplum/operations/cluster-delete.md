# Deleting a {{ GP }} cluster

* [Disable deletion protection](update.md#change-additional-settings) for the cluster if it is enabled.
* [Save the cluster ID](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

## Deleting a cluster {#delete}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. Navigate to the [folder dashboard]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **Yandex MPP Analytics for PostgreSQL**.
  1. Click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) for the appropriate cluster, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.clusters.button_action-delete }}**, and confirm the deletion.

- CLI {#cli}

    {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

    {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

    To delete a cluster, run the command:

    ```bash
    {{ yc-mdb-gp }} cluster delete <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```

    You can request the cluster ID and name with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

    {% include [terraform-delete-mdb-cluster](../../_includes/mdb/terraform-delete-mdb-cluster.md) %}

    {% include [Terraform timeouts](../../_includes/mdb/mgp/terraform-timeouts.md) %}

- REST API {#api}

    1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and put it into the environment variable:

        {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

    1. Use the [Cluster.Delete](../api-ref/Cluster/delete.md) method and send the following request, e.g., via {{ api-examples.rest.tool }}:

        ```bash
        curl \
            --request DELETE \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
            --url 'https://{{ api-host-mdb }}/managed-greenplum/v1/clusters/<cluster_ID>'
        ```

        You can request the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

    1. View the [server response](../api-ref/Cluster/delete.md#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation) to make sure the request was successful.

- gRPC API {#grpc-api}

    1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and put it into the environment variable:

        {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

    1. {% include [grpc-api-setup-repo](../../_includes/mdb/grpc-api-setup-repo.md) %}

    1. Use the [ClusterService.Delete](../api-ref/grpc/Cluster/delete.md) call and send the following request, e.g., via {{ api-examples.grpc.tool }}:

        ```bash
        grpcurl \
            -format json \
            -import-path ~/cloudapi/ \
            -import-path ~/cloudapi/third_party/googleapis/ \
            -proto ~/cloudapi/yandex/cloud/mdb/greenplum/v1/cluster_service.proto \
            -rpc-header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
            -d '{
                  "cluster_id": "<cluster_ID>"
                }' \
            {{ api-host-mdb }}:{{ port-https }} \
            yandex.cloud.mdb.greenplum.v1.ClusterService.Delete
        ```

        You can request the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

    1. View the [server response](../api-ref/grpc/Cluster/delete.md#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation) to make sure the request was successful.
