### Using speech recognition {#rules-stt}

#### Examples {#rules-stt-examples}

- You send a 37-second fragment for speech recognition. Your request is split into three segments: two that are 15 seconds long, and one that is 7 seconds long. The length of the last segment is rounded up to 15 seconds. The final cost of the request is calculated for 45 seconds.
- You made two requests, for 5 and 8 seconds, respectively. The length of each request is rounded up to 15 seconds. The final cost of the request is calculated for 30 seconds.
