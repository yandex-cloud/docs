# Getting started with {{ speechkit-short-name }}

If you want to see how the service synthesizes or recognizes speech, use the demo on the [service page](/services/speechkit#demo).

In this section, you'll learn how to use the {{ speechkit-short-name }} API. First you will create an audio file from text and then try to recognize the audio.

For information about {{ speechkit-name }} usage costs, see [{#T}](pricing.md).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [ai-before-beginning](../_includes/speechkit/ai-before-beginning.md) %}

## Text-to-speech {#text-to-speech}

With [speech synthesis](tts/index.md), you can convert text to speech and save it to an audio file.

Send the [request](tts/request.md) to convert speech to text:

```bash
read -r -d '' TEXT << EOM
> I'm Yandex Speech+Kit.
> I can turn any text into speech.
> Now y+ou can, too!
EOM
export FOLDER_ID=<folder ID>
export IAM_TOKEN=<IAM token>
curl -X POST \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
   --data-urlencode "text=${TEXT}" \
   -d "lang=ru-RU&voice=filipp&folderId=${FOLDER_ID}" \
   "https://tts.{{ api-host }}/speech/v1/tts:synthesize" > speech.ogg
```

Where:

* `TEXT`: Text to be recognized with the applied URL encoding.
* `FOLDER_ID`: Folder ID received [before starting](#before-begin).
* `IAM_TOKEN`: IAM token received [before starting](#before-begin).
* `lang`: [Language](tts/index.md#langs) of the text.
* `voice`: [Voice](tts/voices.md) for speech synthesis.
* `speech.ogg`: The file where the response will be written.

{% note info %}

For homographs, use `+` before the stressed vowel. For example, `+import`, `im+port`. To mark a pause between words, use `-`. Maximum string length: 500 characters.

{% endnote %}

The synthesized speech will be written to the `speech.ogg` file in the directory that you executed this command from.

By default, audio is created in the [OggOpus](https://wiki.xiph.org/OggOpus) format. You can listen to the created file in a browser like [Yandex Browser](https://browser.yandex.ru) or [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org).

[Read more about the request format](tts/request.md) for speech synthesis.

## Speech recognition {#speech-recognition}

The service can recognize speech [in different ways](stt/index.md#stt-ways). In this section, [synchronous recognition](stt/request.md) is used.

Pass the binary content of your audio file in the [request](stt/request.md) body, specifying the following in its parameters:

* `lang`: Desired recognition [language](stt/models.md#tags).
* `folderId`: Folder ID received [before starting](#before-begin).

```bash
curl -X POST \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
   --data-binary "@speech.ogg" \
   "https://stt.{{ api-host }}/speech/v1/stt:recognize?folderId=${FOLDER_ID}&lang=ru-RU"
```

The service responds with the recognized text:

```
{"result":"I'm Yandex SpeechKit. I can turn any text into speech. Now you can, too!"}
```
