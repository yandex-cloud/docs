# IVR integration

You can integrate your [IVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response) platform (such as [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org), [Freeswitch](https://freeswitch.com), [Genesys](https://www.genesys.com/), and [Avaya](https://www.avaya.com/)) with {{ speechkit-full-name }}. This will allow you to set up an interactive voice menu for calls to relieve some of the load on your call center.

To integrate your IVR platform, use [Unispeech plugins](https://www.unispeech.io/yandex) for {{ yandex-cloud }}. Using these plugins on your UniMRCP server, you can perform speech [recognition](../stt/) and [synthesis](../tts/) through the [Media Resource Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Resource_Control_Protocol) (MRCP).
