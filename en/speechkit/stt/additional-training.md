# Extending a speech recognition model

{{ speechkit-name }} provides two ways to improve speech recognition.

## Auto-tuning {#autotuning}

By default, {{ speechkit-name }} doesn't save data passed by users. However, the most effective way to improve a speech recognition model is to train it on real user data.

To improve the quality of speech recognition, you can use the _auto-tuning_ model. With auto-tuning enabled, you can save data transmitted in requests and use it for further training. To do this, specify the `x-data-logging-enabled: true` header in API requests. For an example with logging enabled, see [{#T}](../concepts/support-headers.md).

Auto-tuning helps improve recognition quality while a model is running without any additional assistance.

## Model retraining {#advanced-training}

The basic speech recognition model is designed to work with everyday language, but it may not be sufficient to recognize specific vocabulary. Retraining can help teach a model to recognize domain-specific terms from different fields:

* Medicine: Diagnoses, biological terms, and drug names.
* Business: Company names.
* Trade: Product ranges (jewelry, electronics, and so on).
* Finance: Banking terms and names of banking products.

### Data required for retraining {#data}

The following data is required for model retraining:

* _Glossary_: A full list of terms. The glossary may contain words from audio recordings used for testing and other vocabulary. The glossary should be provided in a separate file, with each term placed on a separate line.
* _Text patterns_: Homogeneous phrases that the model will use to synthesize utterances. The length of a pattern together with variables must not exceed 200 characters.

{% include [data-formats](../../_includes/speechkit/training-data-format.md) %}

Text data will be generated from the received files. Glossary terms are inserted into the variable part of the templates. Retraining will be effective if a sufficient amount of data is used:

* At least 1 thousand utterances.
* At least 3 to 5 phrases, preferably in proportion to the frequency of a term's use in real life.

For example, the `first-name.tsv`, `middle-name.tsv`, and `last-name.tsv` glossary files used for retraining a call center model may contain the first, middle, and last names of customers.

| first-name.tsv | middle-name.tsv | last-name.tsv |
|---|---|---|
| John<br>Tom<br>Peter<br>... <br> | Wendell<br>Sean<br>Larry<br>... <br> | Thompson<br>Carter<br>Smith<br>... <br> |

If the pattern phrases suggest that the glossary terms may be in possessive case forms, you need to create a separate glossary file for each form. For example, files with names in the possessive case will contain the following entries:

| first-name-possessive.tsv | middle-name-possessive.tsv | last-name-possessive.tsv |
|---|---|---|
| John<br>Tom<br>Peter<br>... <br> | Wendell<br>Sean<br>Larry<br>... <br> | Thompson's<br>Carter's<br>Smith's<br>... <br> |

Then the `templates.tsv` file may contain entries like

```
Hello, are you {first-name=first-names.tsv} {middle-name=middle-names.tsv} {last-name=last-names.tsv}?
Hello, can I talk to {first-name=first-names-ablative.tsv} {middle-name=middle-names-ablative.tsv} representative?
```

### Importing retraining data {#import-data}

To transmit retraining data to the {{ speechkit-name }} command, contact your manager. 



### Model availability dates {#commitments}



Changes to a `general:rc` model are usually made over a period of 4 weeks as in any standard release roll-out cycle.
