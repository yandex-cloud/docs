# Recognition models

A recognition model is a model that is trained to recognize speech in a specific language. The models are trained on datasets generated by Yandex services and applications. This allows us to continually improve the quality of speech recognition.

## Supported recognition models {#supported-models}

{% list tabs %}

- Russian
    * `general`: The main supported model for Russian language that recognizes speech on any topic in Russian, including short and long utterances, names, addresses, dates, and numbers.

    ### Tags and version availability {#new-versions}

    We continuously improve the quality of the model and release new versions:
    * The current main version of the model is available by the `general` tag.
    * The experimental version is available by the `general:rc` tag.
    * The previous version is available by the `general:deprecated` tag.

    {% note info %}

    Versions available by the `general:deprecated` tag stop being supported when new models are released: we guarantee two weeks of support for the previous version after updating the version by the `general` tag.

    {% endnote %}

    We recommend testing model versions using the `general:rc` tag and share your feedback with our support team.

    For [long audio fragment recognition](transcribation.md), the following models are also available:
    * The experimental improved model is available under the `hqa` tag.
    * The delayed transcription model is available at a [special price](../pricing.md#prices-stt) under the `deferred-general` tag. This model assumes that audio is queued with a lower priority and processed at the least busy time, but within 24 hours.

    {% note info %}

    For recognition by the `deferred-general` tag, the same version of the model that is available under the `general` tag is used.

    #### Release 26.10.20 {#2610}

    Introducing a new generation of recognition models. The new model is called `hqa` and so far available in transcription only.

    ### Versions {#version}

    #### Anaximander version {#anaximandr}
    * Improved recognition quality due to advances in acoustics processing and language model updates: for example, the word "coronavirus" is now recognized better.
    * Improved model stability on "empty" records.

    #### Marcus Aurelius version {#mark-avr}
    * Improved recognition quality, especially for short audio.
    * The `endOfUtterance` flag is now set more accurately for audio of any length. For audio where there is only silence, this flag isn't returned now.
    * If you activated the `partialResults` flag and use partial recognition results, you may notice that these results are more accurate and come faster now. By default, they now come in unnormalized form.
    * From the _Marcus Aurelius_ version and above, additional recognition settings are supported:
        * If your audio has a lot of background noise, use the reduce sensitivity flag (see [Experimental additional recognition settings](streaming.md#additional-settings)).
        * If you activated the `partialResults` flag and it's important for you to get partial recognition results in normalized form, set the appropriate flag (see [Experimental additional recognition settings](streaming.md#additional-settings)).

    #### Diogenes version {#diogen}
    * Improved phone call recognition quality.
    * Reduced the number of cases where noise is recognized as words. The vocabulary of the model is still extensive: you can use this model to recognize speech on any topic, just like the previous version of the `general` model.
