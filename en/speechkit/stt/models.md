# Recognition models

A recognition model is a model that is trained to recognize speech in a specific language. The models are trained on datasets generated by Yandex services and applications. This allows us to continually improve the quality of speech recognition.

The main supported model for each type of recognition is the `general` model. It recognizes speech on any topic in a given language, including short and long utterances, names, addresses, dates, and numbers.

## Version tags {#tags}

Three versions of the `general` model are available at the same time. You can select the desired version by tag:

* `general`: The main version of the model.
* `general:rc`: The version of a release candidate that you can test.
* `general:deprecated`: The previous version of the model.

{% note info %}

Versions available by the `general:deprecated` tag stop being supported when new models are released: {{ speechkit-name }} guarantees two weeks of support for the previous version after updating the version by the `general` tag.

- Data streaming recognition

   The `general` model supports the following languages:
   * `ru-RU` (default): Russian.
   * `kk-KK`: Kazakh.
   * `en-US`: English.
   * `de-DE`: German.
   * `fr-FR`: French.
   * `fi-FI`: Finnish.
   * `sv-SE`: Swedish.
   * `nl-NL`: Dutch.
   * `pl-PL`: Polish.
   * `it-IT`: Italian.
   * `es-ES`: Spanish.
   * `pt-PT`: Portuguese.
   * `tr-TR`: Turkish.
   * `auto`: Automatic language recognition.

   Possible values are case-insensitive.

   Read more about setting up API requests for streaming recognition on the [Data streaming recognition](streaming.md#specification-msg) page.

- Synchronous recognition

   The `general` model is available for Russian. In the API request, specify the `lang` parameter value.
   * `ru-RU` (default): Russian.

   Possible values are case-insensitive.

   Read more about setting up API requests for short audio recognition on the [Short audio recognition](request.md#query_params) page.

- Asynchronous recognition

   For [asynchronous recognition](transcribation.md), apart from the `general` model, the `deferred-general` model is available. This is a model for delayed recognition at a [special price](../pricing.md#prices-stt). It assumes that audio is queued with a lower priority and processed at the least busy time, but within 24 hours.

   For recognition by the `deferred-general` tag, the same version of the model that is available under the `general` tag is used.

   To set the language, specify the `lang` parameter value in the API request.
   * `ru-RU` (default): Russian.
   * `kk-KK`: Kazakh.

   Possible values are case-insensitive.
