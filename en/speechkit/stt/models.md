# Recognition models and supported languages

A recognition model is a model that is trained to recognize speech in a specific language. The models are trained on datasets generated by Yandex services and applications. This allows us to continually improve speech recognition quality. 

The main supported model for each type of recognition is the `general` model. It recognizes speech on any topic in a given language, including short and long utterances, names, addresses, dates, and numbers.



## Version tags {#tags}

Three versions of the `general` model are available at the same time. You can select the desired version by tag:

* `general`: The main version of the model.
* `general:rc`: The version of a release candidate that you can test.
* `general:deprecated`: The previous version of the model.

{% note info %}

Versions available by the `general:deprecated` tag stop being supported when new models are released: {{ speechkit-name }} guarantees two weeks of support for the previous version after updating the version by the `general` tag.

## Supported recognition languages {#languages}


The list of languages that the model can recognize depends on the recognition mode.

Specify the language in [ISO 639-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) format. All available language code values are case insensitive.

   | `tr-TR` | Turkish |

   For more information about streaming recognition features and API integration, see [Streaming recognition](streaming.md#specification-msg).


- Synchronous recognition

   The `general` model is available for Russian.

   | Code | Language  |
   |---|---|
   | `ru-RU` | Russian (default) |

   In the API request, specify the `lang` parameter value. Learn more about configuring API requests for [synchronous recognition](request.md#query_params).

- Asynchronous recognition

   For [asynchronous recognition](transcribation.md), a language model that can operate in two modes is available:
   1. In standard mode, recognition is processed in a standard priority queue. The standard mode works when the `general` model is selected.
   1. In deferred mode, the audio file to be recognized is placed in a low priority queue and processed at the least busy time. [Special pricing](../pricing.md#prices-stt) applies to deferred recognition. The time required to process an audio file in deferred mode is 24 hours or less. Recognition in deferred mode is available when the `deferred-general` model is specified.

   You can use asynchronous recognition for audio files in the following languages:

   | Code | Language  |
   |---|---|
   | `kk-KK` | Kazakh |
   | `ru-RU` | Russian (default) |

   In the API request, specify the `lang` parameter value. Learn more about configuring API requests for [asynchronous recognition](transcribation.md#sendfile-params).
