# Supported languages and recognition models

A recognition model is a model that is trained to recognize speech in a specific language. The models are trained on datasets generated by Yandex services and applications. This allows us to continually improve speech recognition quality. 

The main supported model for each type of recognition is the `general` model. It recognizes speech on any topic in a given language, including short and long utterances, names, addresses, dates, and numbers.


## Version tags {#tags}

Three versions of the `general` model are available at the same time. You can select the desired version by tag:

* `general`: The main version of the model.
* `general:rc`: The version of a release candidate that you can test.
* `general:deprecated`: The previous version of the model.

{% note info %}

Versions available by the `general:deprecated` tag stop being supported when new models are released: {{ speechkit-name }} guarantees two weeks of support for the previous version after updating the version by the `general` tag. You can find the list of updates in [{#T}](../release-notes-stt.md).

{% endnote %}

In addition, the `deferred-general` tag is available for asynchronous recognition. [Learn more about asynchronous recognition modes](transcribation.md#modes).


## Supported recognition languages {#languages}

Specify the language in [ISO 639-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) format. All available language code values are case insensitive.
