## Speech recognition {#stt}

### Streaming recognition {#streaming-stt}

[{#T}](../stt/api/streaming-examples-v3.md)

This example uses the Russian language, an LPCM streaming audio file with a sampling rate of 8,000 Hz, and a single audio channel. The profanity filter is enabled in recognition settings.

[{#T}](../stt/api/microphone-streaming.md)

This example uses the Russian language, the LPCM audio stream format with a sampling rate of 8,000 Hz, and a single audio channel. The profanity filter is enabled.

[{#T}](../stt/api/stt-language-labels-example.md)

This example uses the LPCM audio stream format with a sampling rate of 8,000 Hz and a single audio channel.


[{#T}](../stt/api/streaming-examples.md)

The example uses the Russian language and the LPCM audio stream format with a sampling rate of 8,000 Hz. Profanity and intermediate result filters are enabled.

### Synchronous recognition {#sync-stt}

[{#T}](../stt/api/request-examples.md)

The example shows recognition of Russian speech.

### Asynchronous recognition {#async-stt}

[{#T}](../stt/api/transcribation-lpcm.md)

This example uses the Russian language, the `general:rc` language model, the LPCM audio file format with a sampling rate of 8,000 Hz, and a single audio channel.

[{#T}](../stt/api/transcribation-ogg.md)

The example shows recognition of Russian speech.

[{#T}](../stt/api/batch-transcribation.md)

The example uses the Russian language and the `general` model. Speech is recognized from audio files of any [supported format](../formats.md) regularly uploaded to {{ objstorage-name }} buckets.


## Synthesis {#tts}

[{#T}](../tts/api/tts-examples-v3.md)

This example uses the LPCM audio stream format with a sampling rate of 22,050 Hz, a WAV container, and the LUFS loudness normalization.


[{#T}](../tts/api/tts-wav.md)

The example uses the Russian language, the LPCM audio file format with a sampling rate of 48,000 Hz, a WAV container, and the `filipp` voice.

[{#T}](../tts/api/tts-ogg.md)

The example uses the Russian language and the `filipp` voice.

[{#T}](../tts/api/tts-ssml.md)

The example uses the Russian language and the `jane` voice.

[{#T}](../tts/api/tts-templates.md)

The example uses pattern-based synthesis for {{ brand-voice-core-name }} and {{ brand-voice-premium-name }} voices.

[{#T}](../tts/api/tts-templates-bvcc.md)

The example uses pattern-based synthesis for {{ brand-voice-cc-name }} voices.
