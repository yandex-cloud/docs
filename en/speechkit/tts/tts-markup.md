# TTS markup

TTS markup grants the ability to control speech synthesis using special characters and SIL tags. This helps make synthesized speech more natural.


Support for TTS markup is available for Russian in the [API v1](request.md) when transmitting data in `text` format and in the API v3.

## Markup components {#markup-elements}

| Description | Special characters and tags |
|---------------------------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Apply stress](#a) | `+` |
| [Explicitly define a pause between sentences](#pause) | `sil<[t]>`, where t is the pause in milliseconds. |
| [Define a pause depending on the context](#context-pause) | `<[small]>`. Acceptable values: `tiny`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `huge` |
| [Place emphasis](#accent) | `<[accented]>` or `**emphasized word**` |

### Apply stress {#a}

Use `+` before a stressed vowel any time you need to define the correct way to pronounce a word, such as:

```
They signed the c+ontract the following day.
```

or

```
If you contr+act malaria, you will have to spend a long time in a hospital.
```

### Explicitly define a pause between sentences {#pause}

To explicitly define a pause between sentences, you can add a special tag, `sil<[t]>`, where t is the duration of the pause in milliseconds:

```
Stop. sil<[300]> Think about it!
```

### Set a pause depending on the context {#context-pause}

Use cue words to automatically select the duration of pauses.

```
Frost and sun; <medium> a wonderful day!
```

### Place emphasis {#accent}

To define emphasis, you can use the `<[accented]>` tag or highlight a word like this: ``**accented**``. For example:

```
Convenient interfaces for solving <[problems]>.
```

or

```
You become responsible **forever** for what you have tamed.
```
