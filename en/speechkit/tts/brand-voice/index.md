{{ brand-voice-name }} technology lets you create unique voices for a speech synthesis model. To cater to different practical purposes of trained models, {{ yandex-cloud }} offers three types of {{ brand-voice-name }}.

| | [{{ brand-voice-premium }}](#premium) | [{{ brand-voice-core }}](#ss) | [{{ brand-voice-cc }}](#cc) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voice | Voice based on artist recordings | Voice based on artist recordings | Voice copy from the pattern |
| Usage | Full-text synthesis. Pattern-based synthesis. | Full-text synthesis. Pattern-based synthesis. | Pattern-based synthesis. The variable part should not exceed 25% of the pattern. |
| Emotions and roles | Coping emotions in pattern-based synthesis. </br>Developing additional [roles](../index.md{#role}). | Coping emotions in pattern-based synthesis. | Coping emotions in pattern-based synthesis. |
| Sampling frequency in source audio recordings | 48 kHz | 48 kHz | {{ tts-cc-quality }} or higher. |
| Sampling frequency in synthesized audio recordings | 22 kHz | 22 kHz | {{ tts-cc-quality }} |

## {{ brand-voice-premium-name }} {#premium}

{{ brand-voice-premium-name }} is suitable for any business task:
* Voice assistants.
* Call center robot operators.
* Voicing arbitrary texts.

Creating a full-fledged model with a unique voice requires large amounts of audio recordings. {{ yandex-cloud }} experts will help you prepare the data for {{ brand-voice-premium-name }} model training, select a studio and an artist for you, and support you at each step of voice creation.

Once created, the {{ brand-voice-premium-name }} voice can be enhanced by various [roles](../index.md#role).

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

## {{ brand-voice-core-name }} {#ss}

If you have pre-recorded audios for training the model, you can create a {{ brand-voice-core-name }} voice based on them. With a voice like this, you can easily convert texts of any length into spoken language and synthesize speech using patterns. Based on such a voice, you can create voice assistants or robots for your call center.

{% note warning %}

The quality of synthesized speech depends directly on the quality of audio recordings used to train the model. When creating a {{ brand-voice-core-name }} voice, you are in charge of the entire process of training data preparation.

{% endnote %}

You can add diverse emotions to your {{ brand-voice-core-name }} voice using [pattern-based synthesis](../templates.md). In pattern-based synthesis, intonations are copied from your audio recordings.

{% note info %}

When using pattern-based synthesis with {{ brand-voice-full-name }} voices, make sure your patterns are recorded by the same artist who made recordings for your {{ brand-voice-full-name }} voice.

{% endnote %}

## {{ brand-voice-cc-name }} {#cc}

{{ brand-voice-cc-name }} is purpose-designed for call center automation and other business tasks involving phone calls:
* Telemarketing.
* Receiving calls to level 1 technical support.
* Conducting surveys.
* Call center automation.

{{ brand-voice-cc-name }} technology allows you to convert texts into speech based on _patterns_, which are specially prepared phrases with changeable key parts (_variables_). {{ brand-voice-cc }} You do not have to train a special model based on your artist's voice, as the voice will be copied directly from the patterns you provide for phrase generation. The speech is synthesized integrally rather than combined using a pre-recorded pattern and a generated variable part.

{{ brand-voice-cc-name }} can only be used in phone calls. The texts used for synthesis should be short enough: the duration of a synthesized phrase cannot exceed {{ tts-v3-time }}, while its length, including the variable part, cannot be more than {{ tts-v3-count }}.

You can use {{ brand-voice-cc-name }} to easily automate your standard dialogs.

> For example, if you have an audio with the phrase `Hi Michael, I am calling from Thunderclouds. My name is Anastasia. Is this a good time to talk?` You can easily transform it to `Hi Ann, I am calling from New Doors. My name is Matt. Is this a good time to talk?` without having to record any additional phrases.

### {{ brand-voice-cc-name }} requirements and restrictions {#restrictions-cc}

{{ brand-voice-cc-name }} does not need any training data because the model copies the voice from the pattern. This is why, for speech synthesis, you only need an audio file with your phrase pattern and a text with marked up variables. To learn more about text requirements, see [{#T}](../templates.md#requirements-text). 

The sampling frequency in the synthesized audio recording is {{ tts-cc-quality }}. This is enough for phone calls. However, in other scenarios, you might hear some noises and flaws of synthesis.

The texts used for synthesis should be short enough: the duration of a synthesized phrase cannot exceed {{ tts-v3-time }}, while its length, including the variable part, cannot be more than {{ tts-v3-count }}.

By default, {{ brand-voice-cc-name }} logs your transmitted patterns (both text and audio). However, the synthesized audio recordings and variable parts, including your sensitive data, are not logged. You can disable logging using the `-data-logging-enabled: false` [header](../../concepts/support-headers#request-headers), although this might affect the quality of service.
