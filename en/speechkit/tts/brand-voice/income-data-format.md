# Input data format for {{ brand-voice-full-name }} Adaptive

{{ brand-voice-name }} Adaptive is a platform for training interactive robots. It synthesizes phrases based on the recordings of the speaker's voice using templates.

Below is a description of the requirements applicable to the training of a synthesis model using {{ brand-voice-full-name }} Adaptive.

## Audio sample requirements {#recording}

| Requirement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Sampling frequency | 48 kHz |
| Audio bit depth | 16 bit PCM |
| Number of channels | 1 (mono) |
| Format | [WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) |

The following conditions must also be met:

* No echo.
* No background noise.
* Minimal post-processing.
* The silence at the beginning and end of a recording is no longer than 1 second.

### Equipment and recording requirements {#hardware}

Background noise and echo during recording directly affect the resulting quality of speech synthesis. A room equipped with acoustic panels is a great place to record audio. If recording in a household environment, echo can be reduced by soft surfaces and furniture, such as a carpet, upholstered sofa, and so on.

We recommend that you make all recordings in the same conditions and in the same room. This applies to both recording the speaker's source audio files needed for training the voice model and recording patterns.

### Speaker requirements {#dictor}

* The volume of speech in all recordings must be the same.
* All phrases must be spoken in the same manner and with the same emotion.

**Recommendations:**

* If the speaker is not a professional, we recommend recording speech for no more than 2 hours a day.
* If the speaker can't understand a phrase or it seems unnatural, they should skip it.
* If the speaker is not sure how to pronounce a phrase correctly or thinks that it sounds unnatural, they should skip this phrase.

## Requirements for resulting data {#data}

To train a voice model, you need:
* A ZIP archive of audio recordings in WAV format, which contains:
   1. A primary set (basic bucket). A basic bucket contains a set of phrases to pronounce and record that has been specifically prepared by the {{ yandex-cloud }} team. You can't change this set. You can only skip some phrases.
   1. A set for making phrases (a specific bucket). Recorded patterns are used as texts. They are then synthesized, taking variables into account. This set is based on user data and must be reviewed before recording.

* Audio transcripts as a [TSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) table. The table with texts should consist of two columns:
   1. `recording`: The name of the audio file where the speaker recorded the spoken text (used as a template with a substituted variable).
   1. `text`: A line with a verbatim transcript of the audio recording. The variable part of the template must be in `{variable_name = variable_value}` format. The names of variables must be constant within the same template.

Transcripts must be encoded in UTF-8, and the table must not have a header.

### Basic dataset requirements {#dataset-requirements}

* One phrase to one recorded audio file.
* No inaccuracies, micro repeats, reservations, and word substitutions are allowed.
* Each audio recording must have an absolutely accurate text transcript.
* Transcripts must not have any grammatical errors.
* To name files, use phrase numbers.
* Sounds such as <q>th</q> must be pronunced. Misspelt words, such as <q>necessery</q> instead of <q>necessary</q> are not acceptable.
* Abbreviations must be denormalized (BBC -> <q>biːbiːsiː</q>) or expanded.

### Pattern requirements {#pattern-requirements}

* The pattern must match the desired script.
* The pattern must contain one or more variables to replace.
* The length of the variable portion must match the sample in the pattern. If variables vary greatly in length, we recommend recording several patterns with examples of different lengths.
* Divide long utterances into independent sentences and different patterns.
* For each pattern, there must be at least 10 options of variables that differ in the duration of pronunciation.
   For example:
   > Hello, I'm **Anastasia** from **Yandex Cloud**.
   >
   > Hello, I'm **Anna** from **Yandex**.

### Text requirements {#text-requirements}

1. All data must be normalized: lines of text to synthesize cannot include numbers or abbreviations, such as <q>15 Smith st., bl. 3</q> or <q>RUB 13.10</q>. Numbers must be written out in words and abbreviations must be spelled out.

1. In homographs where the stress may be ambiguous, you must explicitly indicate the stressed vowel with the `+` sign.
   > _<q>The +import of goods from foreign countries</q>_: Stress falls on the first syllable.
   > _<q>Goods they im+port from China.</q>_: Stress falls on the second syllable.



1. In questions, it's necessary to specify which word should be \*\*logically stressed\*\* to indicate the intonation of an interrogative sentence.

   {% note warning %}

   The logical stress should not fall on the variable part of the phrase.

   {% endnote %}

   > The sentence <q>Did the cat go to the forest?</q> can be read three different ways:
   > * Did the \*\*cat\*\* go to the forest? Meaning, <q>Who was it that went to the forest? Was it really the cat?</q>
   > * Did the cat \*\*go\*\* to the forest? Meaning, <q>Did the cat walk or run?</q> or <q>Was the action itself performed? Is the cat gone or not?</q>
   > * Did the cat go \*\*to the forest\*\*? Meaning <q>Where did the cat go and why? To the forest, outside, to look for a sausage?</q>
   >
   > In all sentences, the logical stress emphasizes the main meaning of the sentence.

1. The length of the sentence, including the variable portion, must not exceed {{ tts-v3-count }} characters.

### Example of a summary text table {#example}

The table title is given as an example, it must be excluded from the uploaded file.

The file encoding is UTF-8.
