# Speech synthesis from SSML text using API v1

With the [API v1](../request.md), you can synthesize speech from text marked up using [SSML](../markup/ssml.md) to an [OggOpus](../../formats.md) file.

The example uses the following synthesis parameters:

* [Language](../index.md#langs): Russian.
* [Voice](../voices.md): `jane`.
* Other parameters were left with their default values.

The text file is read using the [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)) utility.

The Yandex account or federated account are authenticated using an [IAM token](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md). If you use your service account, you do not need to include the folder ID in the request. For more information about authentication in the {{ speechkit-name }} API, see [{#T}](../../concepts/auth.md).

- Bash

   1. Create a file, e.g., `text.xml`, and enter text in the SSML format:

      {% include [ssml-example](../../../_includes/speechkit/ssml-example.md) %}

   1. Send a request with the text to the server:

      ```bash
      export FOLDER_ID=<folder ID>
      export IAM_TOKEN=<IAM token>
      curl -X POST \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
        --data-urlencode "ssml=`cat text.xml`" \
        -d "lang=ru-RU&voice=jane&folderId=${FOLDER_ID}" \
        "https://tts.{{ api-host }}/speech/v1/tts:synthesize" > speech.ogg
      ```

      Where:

      * `FOLDER_ID`: [ID of the folder](../../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md).
      * `IAM_TOKEN`: [IAM token](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md).
      * `ssml`: File with text marked up according to [SSML](../markup/ssml.md) rules.
      * `lang`: [Language](../index.md#langs) of the text.

   The synthesized speech will be written to the `speech.ogg` file in the directory from which you sent your request.
