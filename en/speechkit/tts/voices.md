# List of voices

This section provides a list of voices available in the service and their characteristics:

* The main language that a voice supports. This is the language used by the speaker when creating this voice.
* Voice gender: male or female.
* Available voice [modes](index.md#role).
* Supported API version.

You can listen to voice samples on the [SpeechKit page](https://cloud.yandex.com/services/speechkit).

The voices of `oksana` and `alena` have been created from the recordings of a single voice artist. The voice `oksana` is no longer on the supported voice list, the voice `alena` in `good` mode is used instead. The voice `oksana` is available for legacy projects.

If existing voices are not suitable for your project, {{ speechkit-name }} can create a voice specifically for you. For more information about creating unique voices, see [{#T}](brand-voice/index.md).
