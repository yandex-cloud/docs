# List of voices

This section provides a list of voices available in the service and their characteristics:

* The main language that a voice supports. This is the language used by the speaker when creating this voice.

    If you don't choose the main language, the speech quality will be worse and the voice used may not be the one you specified.

* Voice gender: male or female.

* Information about whether emotions are fully supported for this language.

    If they're not, we don't recommend using emotions: the intonation will change slightly, but the voice may change when synthesizing individual sentences.
