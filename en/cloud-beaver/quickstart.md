# Getting started with {{ cloud-beaver.name }}

To get started with the service:

1. Enable access from the management console in the appropriate cluster's advanced settings if it isn't enabled.
1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the {{ cloud-beaver.name }} page.
1. In the **Connection** menu, select **YC Database**.

   The window displays the hierarchy of your clouds and folders. To quickly find the resource you need, use the input field.

1. Choose the desired folder in the appropriate cloud and the desired DBMS cluster in it.
1. Select the cluster and click **Create**.
1. Click on the connection in the left panel and enter the username and password.

   {% note tip %}

   To avoid entering the credentials the next time you connect to the cluster, enable the **Save credentials** option.

   {% endnote %}

1. Click **LOGIN**.

The list of DBMS resources opens in the panel on the left.

For more information about working with database objects in the service interface, see the [CloudBeaver documentation](https://cloudbeaver.io/docs/CloudBeaver-overview/).
