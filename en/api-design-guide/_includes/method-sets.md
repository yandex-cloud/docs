* [Standard API methods](../concepts/standard-methods.md) allow you to perform CRUD operations: create, retrieve, update, and delete resources. Standard methods have the same signature and work in the same way for all APIs.
* [Additional API methods](../concepts/custom-methods.md) enhance the functionality of standard methods. You can use them to attach a disk, restart a VM, and perform other operations. The signature of additional methods differs from that of standard ones.
