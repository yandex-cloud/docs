* [Standard API methods](../concepts/standard-methods.md) allow you to perform CRUD operations: create, retrieve, update, and delete resources. Standard methods have the same semantics and work in the same way for all APIs.
* [Additional API methods](../concepts/custom-methods.md) enhance the functionality of standard methods. They can be used to perform operations such as attaching a disk, restarting a VM instance, and so on. The semantics of additional methods differs from that of standard ones.
