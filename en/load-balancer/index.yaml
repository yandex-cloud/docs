    Yandex Network Load Balancer is a service that helps ensure the fault tolerance of
    applications by evenly distributing network load across cloud resources. The
    service lets you create <a
    href="https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/load-balancer/concepts/">network load
    balancers</a> and combine cloud resources into <a
    href="https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/load-balancer/concepts/target-resources">target
    groups</a> that you can distribute traffic across. Target group resources
    that are attached to a load balancer are regularly polled through <a
    href="https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/load-balancer/concepts/health-check">health
    checks</a>. This ensures traffic is only sent to healthy resources.
