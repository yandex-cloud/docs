# Access management

In this section, you'll learn:

* [What resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [What roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [What roles are required](#choosing-roles) for particular actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

## What resources you can assign roles to. {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

## What roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

The diagram shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. For example, the `editor` role includes all `viewer` role permissions. A description of each role is given under the diagram.

Active roles in the service:

* Service roles:
    * {% include [resource-manager.clouds.owner](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/resource-manager.clouds.owner.md) %}
    * {% include [resource-manager.clouds.member](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/resource-manager.clouds.member.md) %}
    * {% include [load-balancer.viewer](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/load-balancer.viewer.md) %}
    * {% include [load-balancer.privateAdmin](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/load-balancer.privateAdmin.md) %}
    * {% include [load-balancer.admin](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/load-balancer.admin.md) %}
* Primitive roles:
    * {% include [viewer](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/viewer.md) %}
    * {% include [editor](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/editor.md) %}
    * {% include [admin](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/admin.md) %}

## What roles do I need {#choosing-roles}

The table below lists the roles needed to perform a given action. You can always assign a role granting more permissions than the role specified. For example, you can assign `editor` instead of `viewer`.

Any operations with a load balancer that has a public IP address require the `load-balancer.admin` role. In networks where target groups are located, you can have the `vpc.publicAdmin` role instead. Operations on the internal load balancer require the `load-balancer.privateAdmin` role and operations on its target groups â€” the `load-balancer.privateAdmin` or `compute.admin` role.

Operations on target groups located in subnets, where the specified administrative roles are missing, require the `vpc.user` role for these subnets.
