# Getting started with {{ kms-name }}

In this guide, you create your first [key](../concepts/index.md) and encrypt and decrypt text using {{ kms-short-name }}.

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

To start working with {{ kms-name }}:

1. Log in to [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). If you aren't registered, go to the management console and follow the instructions.
1. [On the billing page]({{ link-console-billing }}) make sure that you enabled a [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md), and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you don't have a billing account, [create one](../../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. Make sure that you have the `owner` or `editor` role for the cloud.
1. If you don't have the Yandex.Cloud command line interface yet, [install and initialize it](../../cli/quickstart#install).

## Create a symmetric encryption key {#create-key}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

    Create a symmetric encryption key:
    1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you want to create a key.
    1. Select {{ kms-name }}.
    1. In the **Keys** tab, click **Create** and set the key parameters:
       * In the **Name** field, enter `my-first-key`.
       * In the **Encryption algorithm** field, specify `AES-256`.
       * In the **Rotation period, days** field, leave the the value `No rotation`.
       * Click **Create**.
    1. Click the line with the key name and make sure the **Versions** section contains the first key version.

{% endlist %}

## Encrypt text using the key {#encrypt}

Come up with a secret text, for example <q>The launch is scheduled for Marchember 42.</q>. The text size must not exceed 32 KB. To encrypt large volumes of data, use [envelope encryption](../concepts/encryption.md#envelope-encryption).

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

    Encrypt the text:

    1. Save the secret text to the `plaintext.txt` file.

    1. Copy the ID of the previously created key from the management console.
        1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder where the key was created.
        1. Select {{ kms-name }}.
        1. In the window that opens, copy the key from the **ID** field.

    1. Encrypt the text:

       ```
       yc kms symmetric-crypto encrypt \
        --id <key ID> \
        --plaintext-file plaintext.txt \
        --ciphertext-file ciphertext
       ```

    The result is a binary file named `ciphertext` containing ciphertext.

{% endlist %}

## Decrypt the text {#decrypt}

Decrypt the `ciphertext` binary file from the previous step.

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

    Decrypt the text:

    ```
    yc kms symmetric-crypto decrypt \
    --id <key ID> \
    --ciphertext-file ciphertext \
    --plaintext-file decrypted.txt
    ```

    As a result, the `ciphertext` file is decrypted and the following decrypted text is written to the `decrypted.txt` file: <q>The launch is scheduled for Marchember 42.</q>.

{% endlist %}
