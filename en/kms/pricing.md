  After a key is deleted, all its versions are still charged for three days, [as per the deletion process](operations/key.md#delete).

* Number of performed cryptographic operations ([encrypt](api-ref/SymmetricCrypto/encrypt), [decrypt](api-ref/SymmetricCrypto/decrypt), [reEncrypt](api-ref/SymmetricCrypto/reEncrypt), and [generateDataKey](api-ref/SymmetricCrypto/generateDataKey)).
