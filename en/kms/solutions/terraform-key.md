# Managing {{ kms-short-name }} keys with Hashicorp Terraform

[The Terraform provider for Yandex.Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/yandex/index.html) supports the use of {{ kms-short-name }} keys.

## Adding keys {#add}

You can add a {{ kms-short-name }} key using the [yandex_kms_symmetric_key](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/yandex/r/kms_symmetric_key.html) block:

```
resource "yandex_kms_symmetric_key" "kms-key" {
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }

  name              = "example-symetric-key"
  description       = "description for key"
  default_algorithm = "AES_256"
  rotation_period   = "8760h" // equal to 1 year
}
```

{% note warning %}

Deleting a {{ kms-short-name }} key destroys all data encrypted with that key: the data becomes unrecoverable after the key is deleted. The `lifecycle` block is necessary to prevent users from destroying keys (with the `terraform destroy` command, for example).

{% endnote %}

## Managing key access {#security}

To manage access to keys in Terraform, assign the necessary roles for the folder that contains the key.

For example, assign a role for the service account, which grants the permission to encrypt and decrypt data with keys from a specific folder:

```
data "yandex_iam_policy" "encrypter_decrypter_iam_policy" {
  binding {
    role = "kms.keys.encrypterDecrypter"

    members = [
      "serviceAccount:<service account ID>",
    ]
  }
}

resource "yandex_resourcemanager_folder_iam_policy" "folder_iam_policy" {
  folder_id   = "<folder ID>"
  policy_data = "${data.yandex_iam_policy.encrypter_decrypter_iam_policy.policy_data}"
}
```
