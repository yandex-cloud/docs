# {{ mrd-name }} pricing policy before February 1, 2020

{% include [currency-choice](../../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}

{% include [pricing-status.md](../../_includes/mdb/pricing-status.md) %}


## What goes into the cost of using {{ mrd-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mrd-name }} usage cost is based on:

* Type and size of the disk selected for the cluster hosts.

* [Class of hosts](../concepts/instance-types.md);

* Number of DB hosts per cluster.

* Size of backups.

* Amount of outgoing traffic.

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}


### DB host usage {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of the host's operation in accordance with its class. You can find class specifications in the [Host classes](../concepts/instance-types.md) section.

The minimum billing unit is one hour (for example, 1.5 hours of operation cost the same as 2 hours). You are not paying for the time when the {{ RD }} host is unable to perform its main functions.


### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

You pay for the following:

* Disk space allocated for database clusters.

* Space used by DB backups in excess of the disk space requested for the cluster.

   * Backups are stored free of charge as long as the total size of the DB and all its backups is smaller than the selected storage size.
   * The requested disk size is allocated for each host, so the number of cluster hosts does not affect the size of the storage and, therefore, the free volume of backups.

The cost is specified for one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per hour (e.g., storing 1 GB for 1.5 hours costs the same as for 2 hours).


## Pricing {#prices}

{% note info %}

As of February 1, 2020, service pricing [changes](pricing-01022020.md#prices): the cost of clusters will be calculated directly based on the computing resources used, not the host class.

{% endnote %}


### Hosts {#prices-hosts}

The first two tabs show the cost per {{ mrd-name }} host per month and per hour.

The data in the **Per 1 GB RAM** tab is given for reference purposes: the table shows how the cost of 1 GB of RAM changes as the host class is increased.
