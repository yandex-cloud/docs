# Maintenance in {{ mrd-name }}

Maintenance means:

* Automatic installation of DBMS updates and fixes for hosts (including for disabled clusters).
* Scheduled [automatic increase of storage size](storage.md#auto-rescale).
* Other maintenance activities.

Changing a major DBMS version is not part of maintenance. For more information about migrating between major versions, see [{#T}](../operations/cluster-version-update.md).

## Maintenance window {#maintenance-window}

You can set the preferred maintenance time when [creating a cluster](../operations/cluster-create.md) or [updating its settings](../operations/update.md):

{% include [Maintenance window](../../_includes/mdb/maintenance-window.md) %}

## Maintenance procedure {#maintenance-order}

The {{ mrd-name }} cluster maintenance procedure depends on the number of hosts and the presence of [shards](sharding.md).

### Non-sharded cluster

The maintenance procedure is as follows:

1. [Replica hosts](replication.md) undergo maintenance one by one. The hosts are queued randomly. A replica becomes temporarily unavailable if it needs to be restarted during maintenance.
1. Maintenance is performed on a master host. If it is restarted and becomes unavailable, one of the replicas takes its role. A single-host cluster will be unavailable during its maintenance.

### Sharded cluster

In sharded clusters, maintenance is performed shard by shard in ascending order by shard number. Host maintenance in each shard is the same as in non-sharded clusters:

1. Replica hosts undergo maintenance one by one. The hosts are queued randomly. A replica becomes temporarily unavailable if it needs to be restarted during maintenance.
1. Maintenance is performed on a master host. If it is restarted and becomes unavailable, one of the replicas takes its role. A single-host shard will be unavailable during its maintenance.
