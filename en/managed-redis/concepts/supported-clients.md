# DBMS clients supported in {{ mrd-name }}

{{ mrd-short-name }} guarantees operation only with certain DBMS clients, but you are free to use other clients without restrictions.

The following clients are supported:
* Standard `redis-cli`.
* `telnet` utility.
* [redis](https://pypi.org/project/redis/) Python package.
* [jedis](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/redis.clients/jedis) Java client.
* [ioredis](https://www.npmjs.com/ioredis) Node.js package.
* [go-redis](https://github.com/go-redis/redis) Go client.

{% note info %}

To connect via SSL, use the `redis-cli` client built with the `BUILD_TLS=yes` flag. For more information, see examples of connection strings for a [sharded](../operations/connect/sharded.md#bash) or [unsharded](../operations/connect/non-sharded.md#bash) cluster.
