# Connecting to a sharded cluster

To connect to a [sharded](../../concepts/sharding.md) Redis cluster, in connection strings, specify the IP addresses or FQDNs of master hosts in each shard.

Encrypted connection is supported via port `{{ port-mrd-tls }}` and unencrypted via port `{{ port-mrd }}`.

## Connecting to cluster hosts from graphical IDEs {#connection-ide}

{% include [IDE environment settings](../../../_includes/mdb/mrd/ide-envs.md) %}

You can only use graphical IDEs to connect to cluster hosts through an SSL tunnel using a [created VM](./index.md#connect). Before connecting [prepare a certificate](./index.md#get-ssl-cert).

- DBeaver

    Connections to {{ RD }} clusters are only available in [commercial versions of DBeaver](https://dbeaver.com/buy/).

    To connect to a cluster:

    1. Create a new DB connection:
        1. In the **Database** menu, select **New connection**.
        1. Select the **{{ RD }}** database from the list.
        1. Click **Next**.
        1. Specify the connection parameters on the **Main** tab:
            * **Host**: Specify comma-separated FQDNs of master hosts in each shard.
            * **Port**: `{{ port-mrd }}` for a regular cluster or `{{ port-mrd-tls }}` for a cluster with SSL encryption enabled.
            * Under **Authentication**, specify the cluster password.
        1. On the **SSH** tab:
            1. Enable the **Use SSL tunnel** setting.
            1. Specify the SSH tunnel parameters:
                * **Host/IP**: Public IP address of the [VM to connect to](./index.md#connect).
                * **Username**: Username for connecting to the VM.
                * **Authentication method**: `Public key`.
                * **Secret key**: Path to the file with the private key used for connecting to the VM.
                * **Passphrase**: Password of the private key.
        1. On the **SSL** tab:
            1. Enable the **Use SSL** and **Skip hostname validation** settings.
            1. Under **Method**:
                1. Enable the **Set of certificates** setting.
                1. In the **Root certificate** field, specify the path to the file with an [SSL certificate for the connection](#get-ssl-cert).
    1. Click **Test Connection ...** to test the DB connection. If the connection is successful, you'll see the connection status and information about the DBMS and driver.
    1. Click **Ready** to save the database connection settings.
