# Switching the master

In a failover {{ mrd-name }} cluster with multiple hosts, you can switch the master role from the current master host to the replica host. After this operation, the current master host becomes the replica host of the new master.

It takes several minutes on average to switch, and the cluster is available during that time.

A [sharded cluster](../concepts/sharding.md) contains three or more master hosts: one per [shard](../concepts/sharding.md#redis-cluster-structure). Switching the master for a sharded cluster is done for each shard one by one.

- Management console

   To switch the master in a non-sharded cluster:

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder containing a non-sharded cluster.
   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-redis }}**.
   1. Click the name of the cluster and select the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.label_title }}** tab.
   1. In the line of the host with the `MASTER` role, click ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.dialogs.popup-confirm-switch-master_label-title }}**.
   1. In the window that opens, select the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.dialogs.popup-confirm-switch-master_label_confirmation }}** option and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.dialogs.popup-confirm-switch-master_button }}**.

   To switch the master in a sharded cluster:

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder containing a sharded cluster.
   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-redis }}**.
   1. Click the name of the cluster and select the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.label_title }}** tab.
   1. In the line of the host with the `MASTER` role, click ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.dialogs.popup-confirm-switch-master_label-title }}**.
   1. In the window that opens, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.dialogs.popup-confirm-switch-master_button }}**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To switch the master in a non-sharded cluster, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-rd }} cluster start-failover \
     --name <cluster name>
   ```

   To switch the master in a sharded cluster, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-rd }} cluster start-failover \
     --name <cluster name> \
     --hostnames <name of current master host>
   ```

   You can request the cluster name with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md) and the name of the master host for the desired shard with a [list of hosts in the cluster](hosts.md#list).

- API

   To switch the master, use the [startFailover](../api-ref/Cluster/startFailover.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/StartFailover](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#StartFailover) gRPC API call and provide the following in the request:

   * ID of the cluster where you want to switch the master, in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, get a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md).
   * For a sharded cluster only: the name of the current master host of the desired shard in the `hostNames` parameter. To find out the name, request a [list of hosts in the cluster](hosts.md#list).
