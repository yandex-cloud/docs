# Pricing for {{ mrd-name }}


{% include [currency-choice](../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}


{% include [pricing-status.md](../_includes/mdb/pricing-status.md) %}

## What goes into the cost of using {{ mrd-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mrd-name }} usage cost is based on:

{% include [pricing-rules](../_includes/mdb/pricing-rules.md) %}

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### DB host usage {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of operation of the host in accordance with the allocated computing resources. Supported resource configurations are shown in [{#T}](concepts/instance-types.md) while prices for using vCPUs and RAM are quoted in the [Prices](#prices) section.

The minimum billing unit is a minute (for example, 1.5 minutes of host usage cost the same as 2 minutes). You are not charged for time when the {{ RD }} host is not performing its main functions.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

The following is charged:

* Storage allocated for DB clusters.

      * Storage on non-replicated SSDs (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`) can only be ordered for clusters with three or more hosts running Intel Cascade Lake and Intel Ice Lake, in increments of 93 GB.

   * Storage on local SSDs (`local-ssd`) can only be ordered for clusters running Intel Broadwell and Intel Cascade Lake with three or more hosts, in increments of 100 GB.

   For more information about platform-specific storage limitations, see [{#T}](./concepts/storage.md).

* Space used by DB backups in excess of the storage requested for the cluster.

   * Backups are stored free of charge until the sum of the DB size and that of all backups remains less than the selected storage size.
   * The requested storage size is allocated for each host, so the number of hosts in the cluster does not affect the free backup size.

The cost is specified for one month of use and is based on 720 hours per month. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per minute (for example, storing 1 GB for 1.5 minutes costs the same as storing 1 GB for 2 minutes).


## Discount for committed volumes of services (CVoS) {#cvos}

{% include [cvos](../_includes/mdb/cvos.md) %}

{{ mrd-name }} provides two kinds of CVoS: on vCPUs and RAM on the hosts you plan to use in DB clusters. In the management console, you can see potential savings from using a CVoS at the current resource usage. You can also forecast your monthly payments for the desired number of vCPUs and RAM.

{% note info %}

You can use a CVoS to order certain types of resources. For non-supported resources, CVoS columns contain dashes under [Prices](#prices). You currently can't order storage or web traffic this way.
