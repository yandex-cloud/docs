# Migrating databases to {{ mrd-name }}

For data migration, {{ RD }} uses a _logical dump_: this is a file with a sequence of commands to restore the state of databases in the cluster. There are several ways to create a dump. The following example will use [redis-dump-go](https://github.com/yannh/redis-dump-go/).

{% note info %}

A binary RDB dump can't be used for migration, because {{ mrd-name }} doesn't permit accessing file systems on cluster hosts.

{% endnote %}

To migrate {{ RD }} databases from the _source cluster_ to the _target cluster_:

1. [{#T}](#create-dump).
1. [{#T}](#create-vm).
1. [{#T}](#restore-dump).
1. [{#T}](#check-data).

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

1. [Create a {{ mrd-name }} cluster](../operations/cluster-create.md) with any desirable configuration.
1. [Set up security groups](../operations/connect.md#configuring-security-groups) for the cluster and the intermediate VM. {#configure-security-groups}
1. (Optional) Install utilities for downloading and uploading files over SSH, for example:
    * [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)
    * [Putty SCP](https://www.putty.org/)

1. Make sure that [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) is installed on the source cluster.

     It might take a long time to create and restore a dump. To keep these processes alive when your SSH session times out, start them using this utility. If your SSH connection breaks while creating or restoring the dump, reconnect and restore the session state using the command:

    ```bash
    screen -R
    ```

## Connect to the source cluster and create a logical dump {#create-dump}

1. Connect to the source cluster however is convenient.
1. Download the archive with the `redis-dump-go`  utility from the [project page](https://github.com/yannh/redis-dump-go/releases). In the following examples, we'll use version `0.5.1`.

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/yannh/redis-dump-go/releases/download/v0.5.1/redis-dump-go_0.5.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    ```

1. Unpack the archive to the current directory:

    ```bash
    tar xf redis-dump-go_0.5.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    ```

1. Get familiar with the utility launch parameters:

    ```bash
    ./redis-dump-go -h
    ```

1. If connecting to the {{ RD }} cluster requires a password,  enter it in the `REDISDUMPGO_AUTH` environment variable:

    ```bash
    export REDISDUMPGO_AUTH="<{{ RD }} password>"
    ```

1. Start an interactive `screen` session:

    ```bash
    screen
    ```

1. Start creating a logical dump (some parameters are omitted from the example):

    ```bash
    ./redis-dump-go \
        -host <{{ RD }} cluster IP address or FQDN> \
        -port <{{ RD }} port> > <dump file>
    ```

    {% note tip %}

    As the dump is created, the number of processed keys is shown on the screen. Remember or write down the last output value: you'll need it to check that the dump has been recovered completely in the target cluster.

    {% endnote %}

1. When the dump has been created, download it to your computer.

1. End the interactive `screen` session:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

## Create and set up an intermediate VM {#create-vm}

1. [Create a VM running Linux](../../compute/operations/vm-create/create-linux-vm.md) with the following parameters:

    * Under **Image/boot disk selection**, select **Operating systems** â†’ `Ubuntu 20.04`.
    * Under **Network settings**:
        * **Subnet**: Select the subnet with at least one of the {{ mrd-name }} cluster's master hosts.
        * **Public address**: `Auto`.
        * **Internal address**: `Auto`.
        * **Security groups**: Select the [previously configured](#configure-security-groups) security groups.

1. [Connect to the intermediate VM via SSH](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md).

1. If your {{ mrd-name }} cluster was deployed with {{ RD }} version 6 or higher and TLS support enabled:

    1. [Get an SSL certificate](../operations/connect.md#get-ssl-cert).

    1. Add the official {{ RD }} repository to your list of repositories:

        ```bash
        sudo apt-add-repository ppa:redislabs/redis
        ```

        {% note info %}

        The packages in this repository are built with the `BUILD_TLS=yes` flag, so you don't need to manually rebuild them from the source.

        {% endnote %}

1. Update the list of available packages and install the necessary utilities:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-tools screen --yes
    ```

## Restore the dump on the target cluster {#restore-dump}

1. Upload the dump from your computer to an intermediate virtual machine however is convenient.

1. Start an interactive `screen` session:

    ```bash
    screen
    ```

1. Start the dump recovery process:

    * Connecting without using TLS

        **Connecting via Sentinel**

        ```bash
        host=$(redis-cli \
               -h <FQDN of any {{ RD }} host> \
               -p {{ port-mrd-sentinel }} \
               sentinel \
               get-master-addr-by-name \
               no-shards-no-tls | head -n 1)
        redis-cli \
            -h ${host} \
            -p {{ port-mrd }} \
            -a <password for the target cluster> \
            --pipe < <dump file>
        ```

        **Connecting directly to the master host:**

        ```bash
        redis-cli \
            -h <FQDN of the master host> \
            -p {{ port-mrd }} \
            -a <password for the target cluster> \
            --pipe < <dump file>
        ```

        {% include [use-special-fqdn](../../_includes/mdb/mrd-conn-strings-fqdn.md) %}

        **Connecting to a sharded cluster**

        1. Create a script containing the dump-loading commands:

            `load-dump.sh`

            ```bash
            shards=('<FQDN of the master host in shard 1>' \
                    ...
                    '<FQDN of the master host in shard N>')
            
            for shard in "${shards[@]}" ; do
              redis-cli -h "${shard}" \
                        -p {{ port-mrd }} \
                        -a "<password for the target cluster>" \
                        --pipe < <dump file>
            done
            ```

        1. Run the script:

            ```bash
            bash ./load-dump.sh
            ```

            As you run the script, you'll see messages about data insertion errors. This is normal behavior for the `redis-cli` command, because in a sharded cluster, each shard stores only a certain part of the data. For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/sharding.md).

    * Connecting via TLS

        **Connecting via Sentinel**

        ```bash
        host=$(redis-cli \
               -h <FQDN of any {{ RD }} host> \
               -p {{ port-mrd-sentinel }} \
               sentinel \
               get-master-addr-by-name \
               no-shards-tls | head -n 1)
        redis-cli \
            -h ${host} \
            -p {{ port-mrd-tls }} \
            -a <password for the target cluster> \
            --tls \
            --cacert ~/.redis/YandexInternalRootCA.crt \
            --pipe < <dump file>
        ```

        **Connecting directly to the master host:**

        **Connecting to a sharded cluster**

        1. Create a script containing the dump-loading commands:

            `load-dump.sh`

            ```bash
            shards=('<FQDN of the master host in shard 1>' \

                        -a "<password for the target cluster>" \
                        --tls \
                        --cacert ~/.redis/YandexInternalRootCA.crt \
                        --pipe < <dump file>
            done
            ```

        1. Run the script:

            ```bash
            bash ./load-dump.sh
            ```

            As you run the script, you'll see messages about data insertion errors. This is normal behavior for the `redis-cli` command, because in a sharded cluster, each shard stores only a certain part of the data. For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/sharding.md).

        {% endcut %}

    {% endlist %}

1. End the interactive `screen` session:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

## Make sure that the dump is restored completely {#check-data}

1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mrd-name }}**.
1. Click on the name of the cluster and open the [Monitoring](../operations/monitoring.md) tab.

Pay attention to the **DB Keys** chart showing the number of keys stored in the cluster. If the cluster is [sharded](../concepts/sharding.md), the chart will show the number of keys in each shard. In this case, the number of keys in the cluster is equal to the total number of keys in the shards.

The total number of keys in the cluster must be equal to the number of keys processed by the `redis-dump-go` utility when creating the dump.
