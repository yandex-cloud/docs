# Virtual machines

### Technical specifications {#technical-parameters}

#### What VM configuration (memory, vCPU) can I use? {#configure-vm}

{% include [support-channels](../../_includes/compute/compute-resources.md) %}

For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/performance-levels.md).

#### How can I change the amount of RAM and the number of cores allocated to a VM? {#update-type}

For more information, see [{#T}](../operations/vm-control/vm-update-resources.md).

#### How do I create a multi-interface VM? {#multi-interface}

You can only add a network interface when [creating a VM](../operations/index.md#vm-create). Currently, multiple interfaces can only be created using network images from the [Marketplace](https://cloud.yandex.com/marketplace?categories=network).

### Virtual machine parameters {#parameters-vm}

#### How do I increase quotas? {#increase-quotas}

To increase quotas, submit a request on [this page]({{ link-console-quotas }}). Select the service (or services) and specify which quota values you need.

After creating the request, the message appears in the [support section]({{ link-console-support }}) where you can track its status. In some cases, it may be necessary to get approval from the service to ensure the availability of resources and/or to increase your account balance.

#### Can I use nested virtualization? Can I host my VMs inside other VMs? {#nested-virtualization}

Nested virtualization isn't supported for security reasons. If you couldn't find a suitable public image for a VM, you can upload your own image and create a VM from it. Follow the instructions: [{#T}](../operations/vm-create/create-from-user-image.md).

#### Is data saved when I edit the parameters of my virtual machine? {#data-saved-after-change-parameters}

Yes, the data should be saved. However, please note that you shouldn't restart your VM when writing data to the system disk because this might result in file system corruption.

To edit the parameters of your VM, follow these steps:
1. Take a snapshot of the disk: see [{#T}](../operations/disk-control/create-snapshot.md).
1. Shut down the VM normally: see [{#T}](../operations/vm-control/vm-stop-and-start.md).
1. Edit the VM parameters: see [{#T}](../operations/vm-control/vm-update-resources.md).
1. Wait until the operation is completed (the **Operations** section in the {{ compute-name }} service).
1. Start the VM.
1. Make sure that the new parameters were applied.

#### Is it possible to reduce the vCPU/vRAM for a VM? {#reduce-cpu-ram}

Yes, you can. However, if the load on the vCPU and/or vRAM was high enough when you changed the parameters, the VM may fail to start if you decrease these parameters.

If the load on the server is small and uniform, we recommend decreasing the parameters to avoid paying extra.

#### Is it possible to change the FQDN? {#change-fqdn}

The FQDN is issued to the VM at the time of its creation, and you cannot change it.

If you want to change the FQDN, delete the VM and create a new one. To preserve the consistency of the data:
1. Stop the VM: see [{#T}](../operations/vm-control/vm-stop-and-start.md#stop).
1. Take a snapshot of the disk: see [{#T}](../operations/disk-control/create-snapshot.md).
1. Create a new VM by selecting the snapshot as the source of its boot disk: see [{#T}](../operations/vm-create/create-from-snapshots.md). Specify the necessary FQDN during creation.

#### Can the UUID of a VM change? {#change-uuid}

Standard procedures for changing a VM, such as changing the number of vCPUs, the amount of vRAM, and adding disks, won't affect the UUID. However, in some cases, the UUID may change. For example, with updating the BIOS or similar procedures that affect the "hardware" part of the service.

Keep this in mind when using third-party software licenses. It's best if you can purchase a license that isn't linked to the UUID.

#### How do I change metadata after creating a VM? {#change-metadata-after-creating}

Use the [updateMetadata](../api-ref/Instance/updateMetadata.md) API method.

This method enables you to update the metadata in the service without affecting the guest operating system run by the VM. If you need to update a parameter inside your VM after its creation, in most cases, the best way is to recreate the VM from a snapshot or make changes manually.

### Operations on VMs {#operations-on-vm}

#### Can I copy or clone an existing VM? {#clone-vm}

Yes, you can take snapshots of disks attached to a VM and use them when creating a new VM.


#### Can I move my VM to a different availability zone? {#move-az}

You cannot directly change the availability zone where the VM is hosted. However, you can create a copy of the VM in the availability zone you need.


#### Can I move my VM to a different folder? {#move-to-project}

You cannot directly change the folder that the VM belongs to. However, you can create a copy of the VM in the appropriate folder.

#### If I accidentally delete my VM, can I restore it? {#delete-vm2}

No, you can't. Deleting a VM is an irreversible operation.

To avoid losing your data in case of accidental deletion, you can configure disk backups using snapshots or specify that the disks should not be automatically deleted when deleting the VM.
