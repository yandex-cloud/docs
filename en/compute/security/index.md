### Service roles

| Role | Permissions |
| ----- | ----- |
| `compute.admin` | Gives rights to manage virtual machines and [instance groups](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/index.md). |
| `compute.disks.user` | Lets you use disks to create new resources, such as virtual machines. |
| `compute.images.user` | Lets you use images to create new resources, such as virtual machines. |
| `iam.serviceAccounts.user` | Verifies the right to use the service account.<br/>This role is required to perform operations with instance groups. If you enter a service account in the request, {{ iam-short-name }} checks that you have rights to use this account. |
| `resource-manager.clouds.member` | The role required to access resources in the cloud for all users except [cloud owners](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#owner) and [service accounts](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md). |
| `resource-manager.clouds.owner` | Grants you full access to a cloud and the resources in it. You can only assign this role for a cloud. |
