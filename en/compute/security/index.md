# Access management in {{ compute-name }}


In this section, you will learn about:

* [About access management in {{ yandex-cloud }}](#about-access-control).
* [Resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [Roles this service has](#roles-list).
* [What roles are required to perform specific actions](#choosing-roles).

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

{% include [role-note](../../_includes/compute/role-note.md) %}

To assign a role for a resource, a user should have the `compute.admin` role or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

## Which resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

You can also assign roles for individual resources of the service:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  Use the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) to assign roles for the following resources:

  {% include notitle [compute-resources](../../_includes/iam/resources-with-access-control/compute.md) %}

- CLI {#cli}

  You can use the [{{ yandex-cloud }} CLI](../../cli/cli-ref/compute/cli-ref/index.md) to assign roles for the following resources:

  {% include notitle [compute-resources](../../_includes/iam/resources-with-access-control/compute.md) %}

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  Use [{{ TF }}]({{ tf-provider-link }}) to assign roles for the following resources:

  {% include notitle [compute-resources-tf](../../_includes/iam/resources-with-access-control/compute-tf.md) %}

- API {#api}

  You can use the [{{ yandex-cloud }}](../api-ref/authentication.md) API to assign roles for the following resources:

  {% include notitle [compute-resources](../../_includes/iam/resources-with-access-control/compute.md) %}

{% endlist %}

{% include [primitive-roles-footnote](../../_includes/primitive-roles-footnote.md) %}

## What roles do I need {#choosing-roles}

The table below lists the roles required for specific actions. You can always assign a role offering more permissions than the specified one. For example, you can assign the `editor` role instead of `compute.editor`, or the `compute.viewer` role for a [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) instead of a separate VM or disk.
