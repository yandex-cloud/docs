# Creating a placement group

Create a [placement group](../../concepts/placement-groups.md).

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View a description of the CLI command to create a placement group:

      ```bash
      yc compute placement-group create --help
      ```

   1. Create a placement group:

      ```bash
      yc compute placement-group create --spread-strategy --name my-group
      ```

      Result:

      ```bash
      id: fd83bv4rnsna2sjkiq4s
      folder_id: b1g5kkhshgs9s0l4609d
      created_at: "2019-12-30T10:07:34Z"
      name: my-group
      spread_placement_strategy: {}
      ```

      This command creates a placement group with the following characteristics:

      - Named `my-group`.
      - Distributed placement strategy (`spread`).

   1. Check that the placement group was added:

      ```bash
      yc compute placement-group list
      ```

      Result:

      ```bash
      +----------------------+----------+----------+
      |          ID          |   NAME   | STRATEGY |
      +----------------------+----------+----------+
      | fd83bv4rnsna2sjkiq4s | my-group | SPREAD   |
      +----------------------+----------+----------+
      ```

- API

   Use the [create](../../api-ref/PlacementGroup/create.md) REST API method for the [PlacementGroup](../../api-ref/PlacementGroup/index.md) resource or the [PlacementGroupService/Create](../../api-ref/grpc/placement_group_service.md#Create) gRPC API call.

- {{ TF }}

   {% include [terraform-definition](../../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}

   If you do not have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   1. In the configuration file, describe the placement group parameters:

      * `name`: The placement group name. in the following format:

         {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

      * `folder_id`: ID of the folder where the placement group is being created.
      * `description`: The placement group description.

      Example of the configuration file structure:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_compute_placement_group" "group1" {
        name        = "<placement group name>"
        folder_id   = "<folder ID>"
        description = "<placement group description>"
      }
      ```

      For more information about the parameters of the `yandex_compute_placement_group` resource in {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/compute_placement_group).

   1. In the command line, go to the directory with the {{ TF }} configuration file.

   1. Check the configuration using this command:

      ```
      terraform validate
      ```

      If the configuration is correct, you will get this message:

      ```
      Success! The configuration is valid.
      ```

   1. Run this command:

      ```
      terraform plan
      ```

      The terminal will display a list of resources with parameters. No changes are made at this step. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Apply the configuration changes:

      ```
      terraform apply
      ```

   1. Confirm the changes: type `yes` into the terminal and press **Enter**.

      Once you are done, all the resources you need will be created in the specified folder. You can verify that the resources are there and their configuration is correct using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or the following [CLI](../../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

      ```bash
      yc compute placement-group list
      ```

{% endlist %}
