# Create a VM with disks restored from snapshots

You can create a VM with disks restored from the snapshots that exist in the folder. For information on creating a disk snapshot, please see [{#T}](../disk-control/create-snapshot.md).

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   To create a VM:
   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder to create the virtual machine in.
   1. In the list of services, select **{{ compute-name }}**.
   1. Click **Create VM**.
   1. Under **Basic parameters**:
      * Enter a name and description for the VM. Naming requirements:

         {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

         {% include [name-fqdn](../../../_includes/compute/name-fqdn.md) %}

      * Select an [availability zone](../../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to put your virtual machine in.

   1. Under **Image/boot disk selection**, select one of the [images](../../operations/images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md).

   1. Under **Disks and file storage**, [add a disk](./create-from-disks.md):
      * Click **Add disk**.
      * Enter the disk name.
      * Select the [disk type](../../concepts/disk.md#disks_types).
      * Specify the desired block size.
      * Specify the necessary disk size.
      * (optional) Enable the **Delete with the VM** option if you need to automatically delete the disk when deleting the VM it will be attached to.
      * Select `Snapshot` as content.
      * Select the snapshot from the list.
      * Click **Add**.

   1. (optional) Under **Disks and file storage**, click the **File storage tab** and connect a [file store](../../concepts/filesystem.md):
      * Click **Connect file storage**.
      * In the resulting window, select a file store.
      * Enter a device name.
      * Click **Connect file storage**.

   1. Under **Computing resources**:
      * Choose a [platform](../../concepts/vm-platforms.md).
      * Specify the [guaranteed share](../../../compute/concepts/performance-levels.md) and the required number of vCPUs, as well as the amount of RAM.
      * If necessary, make your VM [preemptible](../../concepts/preemptible-vm.md).
      * (optional) Enable a [software-accelerated network](../../concepts/software-accelerated-network.md).

   1. Under **Network settings**:
      * Enter a subnet ID or select a [cloud network](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) from the list.
         If you don't have a network, click **Create network** to create one:
         * In the window that opens, enter the network name and folder to host the network.
         * (optional) To automatically create subnets, select the **Create subnets** option.
         * Click **Create**.
            Each network must have at least one [subnet](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet). If there is no subnet, create one by selecting **Add subnet**.
      * In the **Public IP** field, choose a method for assigning an IP address:
         * **Auto**: Assign a random IP address from the {{ yandex-cloud }} IP pool. With this, you can enable [DDoS protection](../../../vpc/ddos-protection/index.md) using the option below.
         * **List**: Select a public IP address from the list of previously reserved static addresses. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../vpc/operations/set-static-ip.md).
         * **No address**: Don't assign a public IP address.
      * In the **Internal address** field, select the method for assigning internal addresses: **Auto** or **Manual**.
      * (optional) Create a record for the VM in the [DNS zone](../../../dns/concepts/dns-zone.md). Expand the **DNS settings for internal addresses** section, click **Add record** and specify the zone, FQDN and TTL for the record. For more detail, please see [Cloud DNS integration with Compute Cloud](../../../dns/concepts/compute-integration.md).
      * Select [appropriate security groups](../../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) (if there is no corresponding field, the virtual machine will be enabled for all incoming and outgoing traffic).

   1. Under **Access**, specify the data required to access the VM:
      * (optional) Select or create a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md). By using a service account, you can flexibly configure access rights for your resources.
      * Enter the username in the **Login** field.

         {% note alert %}

         Don't use the username `root` or other names reserved by the operating system. To perform operations that require superuser permissions, use the command `sudo`.

         {% endnote %}

      * In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the [public key](../../operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys) file.
      * If required, grant access to the [serial console](../../operations/serial-console/index.md).

   1. Click **Create VM**.

   The virtual machine appears in the list. When a VM is created, it is assigned an [IP address](../../../vpc/concepts/address.md) and [hostname](../../../vpc/concepts/address.md#fqdn) (FQDN).

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View the description of the CLI command for creating a VM:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance create --help
      ```

   1. Prepare snapshots of the required disks, see [{#T}](../disk-control/create-snapshot.md).
   1. Get a list of snapshots in the default folder:

      {% include [compute-snapshot-list](../../_includes_service/compute-snapshot-list.md) %}

   1. Select the identifier (`ID`) or name (`NAME`) of the necessary snapshots.
   1. Create a VM in the default folder:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance create \
          --name first-instance \
          --zone ru-central1-a \
          --public-ip \
          --create-boot-disk snapshot-name=first-snapshot \
          --create-disk snapshot-name=second-snapshot \
          --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      ```

      This command creates a VM named `first-instance` in the `ru-central1-a` availability zone, with a public IP and the disks from the snapshots. To create a VM without a public IP, remove the `--public-ip` flag.

      {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

      {% include [name-fqdn](../../../_includes/compute/name-fqdn.md) %}

- API

   Use the [Create](../../api-ref/Instance/create.md) method for the `Instance` resource.
