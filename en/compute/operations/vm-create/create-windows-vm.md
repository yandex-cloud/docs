# Creating a VM from a Windows public image

This section provides guidelines on how to create a VM with the Windows OS. To create a Linux-based VM, follow the instructions [{#T}](create-linux-vm.md).

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  {% include [create-instance-via-console-windows](../../_includes_service/create-instance-via-console-windows.md) %}

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  {% include [create-instance-via-cli-windows](../../_includes_service/create-instance-via-cli-windows.md) %}

- API

  Create a VM using the method [Create](../../api-ref/Instance/create.md) for the resource `Instance`:

  1. Get an [IAM token](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md) for authenticating in the examples:
     * [Instructions](../../../iam/operations/iam-token/create.md) for users with a Yandex account.
     * [Instructions](../../../iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-sa.md) for a service account.

  1. [Get the ID](../../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) of the folder.

  1. Get information about the image to create your virtual machine from (image ID and minimum disk size):
      * If you know the [image family](../../concepts/image.md#family), get information about the latest image in this family:

          ```bash
          $ export IAM_TOKEN=CggaATEVAgA...
          $ export FAMILY=windows-2016-gvlk
          $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
            "https://compute.api.cloud.yandex.net/compute/v1/images:latestByFamily?folderId=standard-images&family=${FAMILY}"
          
          {
           "productIds": [
            "f2eu62v659or2tqv28l0"
           ],
           "os": {
            "type": "WINDOWS"
           },
           "id": "fd85s1nlcavgdpc16hj3",
           "folderId": "standard-images",
           "createdAt": "2019-04-30T10:53:56Z",
           "name": "windows-2016-gvlk-1556619485",
           "description": "Windows Server 2016 Datacenter is a operating system for virtualized private cloud environments. This version is activated with GVLK. Website and documentation: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/windows-server",
           "family": "windows-2016-gvlk",
           "storageSize": "26344423424",
           "minDiskSize": "26843545600",
           "status": "READY"
          }
          ```
      * You can get information about the image from the [list of public images](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md).

  1. Get the subnet ID and availability zone ID. Specify the ID of the folder where the subnet was created in your request:

      ```bash
      $ export IAM_TOKEN=CggaATEVAgA...
      $ export FOLDER_ID=b1gvmob95yysaplct532
      $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
        "https://vpc.api.cloud.yandex.net/vpc/v1/subnets?folderId=${FOLDER_ID}"
      {
       "subnets": [
        {
         "v4CidrBlocks": [
          "10.130.0.0/24"
         ],
         "id": "b0c6n43ftldh30l0vfg2",
         "folderId": "b1gvmob95yysaplct532",
         "createdAt": "2018-09-23T12:15:00Z",
         "name": "default-ru-central1-c",
         "description": "Auto-created default subnet for zone ru-central1-c",
         "networkId": "enpe3m3fagludao8aslg",
         "zoneId": "ru-central1-c"
        },
        ...
       ]
      }
      ```

  1. Create a file where the body contains your request for VM creation (for example, `body.json`). Specify the following parameters:

      * `folderId`: ID of the folder.

      * `name`: Name to be assigned to the VM when it's created.

      * `zoneId`: Availability zone that corresponds to the selected subnet.

      * `platformId`: The [platform](../../concepts/vm-platforms.md).

      * `resourceSpec`: Resources available to the VM. The values must match the selected platform.

      * `metadata`: In the [metadata](../../concepts/vm-metadata.md) `user-data` property, you need to pass the script with the administrator password, for example:

          ```json
          "metadata": {
            "user-data": "#ps1\nnet user Administrator Passw0rd"
          },
          ```

          {% include [include](../../../_includes/compute/password-requirements.md) %}

      * `bootDiskSpec`: Boot disk settings. Specify the ID of the selected image and disk size. The disk size must not be below the minimum value specified in the image details.

      * `networkInterfaceSpecs`: Network settings.
        * `subnetId`: ID of the selected subnet.
        * `primaryV4AddressSpec`: IP address to be assigned to the VM. To add a [public IP address](../../../vpc/concepts/address.md#public-addresses) to your virtual machine, specify:

            ```
            "primaryV4AddressSpec": {
                "oneToOneNatSpec": {
                  "ipVersion": "IPV4"
                }
              }
            ```

      Read more about the request body format in the [API reference](../../api-ref/Instance/create.md) API method.

      Example `body.json` file:

      ```json
      {
        "folderId": "b1gvmob95yysaplct532",
        "name": "instance-demo-no-pwauth",
        "zoneId": "ru-central1-c",
        "platformId": "standard-v1",
        "resourcesSpec": {
          "memory": "4294967296",
          "cores": "2",
        },
        "metadata": {
          "user-data": "#ps1\nnet user Administrator Passw0rd"
        },
        "bootDiskSpec": {
          "diskSpec": {
            "size": "26843545600",
            "imageId": "fd85s1nlcavgdpc16hj3"
          }
        },
        "networkInterfaceSpecs": [
          {
            "subnetId": "b0c6n43ftldh30l0vfg2",
            "primaryV4AddressSpec": {
              "oneToOneNatSpec": {
                "ipVersion": "IPV4"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

  1. Create a virtual machine:

      ```bash
      $ export IAM_TOKEN=CggaATEVAgA...
      $ curl -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
        -d '@body.json' \
        https://compute.api.cloud.yandex.net/compute/v1/instances
      ```

- Terraform

  If you don't have Terraform yet, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../../solutions/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

  1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:

       {% note info %}

       If you already have suitable resources, such as a cloud network and subnet, you don't need to describe them again. Use their names and IDs in the appropriate parameters.

       {% endnote %}

     * `yandex_compute_instance`: Description of the [VM](../../concepts/vm.md):
       * `name`: VM name.
       * `platform_id`: The [platform](../../concepts/vm-platforms.md).
       * `resources`: The number of vCPU cores and the amount of RAM available to the VM. The values must match the selected [platform](../../concepts/vm-platforms.md).
       * `boot_disk`: Boot disk settings. Specify the ID of the selected image. You can get the image ID from the [list of public images](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md).
       * `network_interface`: Network settings. Specify the ID of the selected subnet. To automatically assign a public IP address to the VM, set `nat = true`.
       * `metadata`: In the [metadata](../../concepts/vm-metadata.md) in the `user-data` parameter, pass the script with the administrator password.
     * `yandex_vpc_network`: Description of the [cloud network](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network).
     * `yandex_vpc_subnet`: Description of the [subnet](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) that the VM will be connected to.

     Example configuration file structure:

     ```
     resource "yandex_compute_instance" "vm-1" {
     
       name        = "windows-vm"
       platform_id = "standard-v2"
     
       resources {
         cores  = <number of vCPU cores>
         memory = <RAM in GB>
       }
     
       boot_disk {
         initialize_params {
           image_id = "<image ID>"
         }
       }
     
       network_interface {
         subnet_id = "${yandex_vpc_subnet.subnet-1.id}"
         nat       = true
       }
     
       metadata = {
         user-data = "#ps1\nnet user Administrator <administrator password>"
       }
     }
     
     resource "yandex_vpc_network" "network-1" {
       name = "network1"
     }
     
     resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "subnet-1" {
       name       = "subnet1"
       zone       = "<availability zone>"
       network_id = "${yandex_vpc_network.<network name>.id}"
     }
     ```

     For more information about the resources you can create using Terraform, see the [provider documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/yandex/index.html).

  2. Make sure that the configuration files are correct.

     1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.

     2. Run the check using the command:

        ```
        $ terraform plan
        ```

     If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal displays a list of created resources and their parameters. If there are errors in the configuration, Terraform points them out.

  3. Deploy the cloud resources.

     1. If the configuration doesn't contain any errors, run the command:

        ```
        $ terraform apply
        ```

     2. Confirm that you want to create the resources.

     Afterwards, all the necessary resources are created in the specified folder. You can check resource availability and their settings in [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
