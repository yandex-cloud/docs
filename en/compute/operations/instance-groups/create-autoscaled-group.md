# Creating an automatically scaled instance group

You can create an automatically scaled group of identical instances. The size of this group will be managed automatically. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#auto-scale).

{% include [warning.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/warning.md) %}

{% include [sa.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/sa.md) %}

To create an automatically scaled instance group

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  {% include [create-autoscaled-group-via-concole.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/create-autoscaled-group-via-concole.md) %}

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. See the description of the CLI's create instance group command:

      ```
      $ {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --help
      ```

  1. Check whether there are networks in the folder:

      ```
      $ yc vpc network list
      ```

      If there aren't any, [create the necessary networks](../../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) in {{ vpc-short-name }}.

  1. Select one of the [public images](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md) (for example, CentOS 7).

      {% include [standard-images.md](../../../_includes/standard-images.md) %}

  1. Create a YAML file with any name (for example, `specification.yaml`).

  1. In the created file, indicate the following:

      - General information about the group:

          ```
          name: first-autoscaled-group
          service_account_id: <ID>
          description: "This instance group was created from YAML config"
          ```

          Keys:

          | Key | Value |
          | ----- | ----- |
          | `name` | A name for the instance group. The name must be unique within the folder. The name may contain lowercase Latin letters, numbers, and hyphens. The first character must be a letter. The last character can't be a hyphen. The maximum length of the name is 63 characters. |
          | `service_account_id` | ID of the service account. |
          | `description` | A description of the instance group. |

      - [Instance template](../../concepts/instance-groups/instance-template.md):

              platform_id: standard-v1
              resources_spec:
                  memory: 4g

          | `network_id` | The `default-net` ID. |
          | `primary_v4_address_spec` | IPv4 specification. Only IPv4 is currently available. You can allow public access to group instances by specifying the IP version for the public IP address. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/instance-template.md#instance-template). |

      - [The policies](../../concepts/instance-groups/policies.md):

          ```

  1. Create an instance group in the default folder:

      ```
      $ {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --file specification.yaml
      ```

      This command creates an automatically scaled instance group with the following characteristics:
      - Named `first-autoscaled-group`.
      - Running CentOS 7.
      - In the `default-net` network.
      - In the `ru-central1-a` availability zone.
      - With a single core and 4 GB RAM.
      - With a 32 GB network HDD.

- API

  Use the [create](../../api-ref/InstanceGroup/create.md).
