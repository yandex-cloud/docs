# Creating an automatically scaled instance group


You can create an automatically scaled group of identical instances. The size of this group will be managed automatically. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#auto-scale).

{% include [warning.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/warning.md) %}

{% include [sa.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/sa.md) %}

To create an automatically scaled instance group

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   {% include [create-autoscaled-group-via-concole.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/create-autoscaled-group-via-concole.md) %}

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View a description of the create instance group command in the CLI:

      ```
      {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --help
      ```

   1. Check whether there are networks in the folder:

      ```
      yc vpc network list
      ```

      If there aren't any, [create one](../../../vpc/operations/network-create.md).

   1. Select one of the [public images](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md) from {{ marketplace-name }} (for example, [CentOS 7](/marketplace/products/yc/centos-7)).

      {% include [standard-images.md](../../../_includes/standard-images.md) %}


   1. Create a YAML file with any name (for example, `specification.yaml`).

   1. In the created file, indicate the following:

      * General information about the group:

         ```
         name: first-autoscaled-group
         service_account_id: <ID>
         description: "This instance group was created from YAML config."
         ```

         Where:

         | Key | Value |
         ----- | -----
         | `name` | A name for the instance group. The name must be unique within the folder. The name may contain lowercase Latin letters, numbers, and hyphens. The first character must be a letter. The last character can't be a hyphen. The maximum length of the name is 63 characters. |
         | `service_account_id` | ID of the service account. |
         | `description` | A description of the instance group. |

      * An [instance template](../../concepts/instance-groups/instance-template.md), such as:

         ```
         instance_template:
             platform_id: standard-v3
             resources_spec:
                 memory: 2g
                 cores: 2
             boot_disk_spec:

                     size: 32g
             network_interface_specs:
                 - network_id: c64mknqgnd8avp6edhbt

             scheduling_policy:

         ```

         {% include [default-unit-size](../../../_includes/instance-groups/default-unit-size.md) %}

         Where (the table contains the keys that directly define the instance parameters):

         | Key | Value |
         ----- | -----
         | `platform_id` | Platform ID. |
         | `memory` | Amount of memory (RAM). |
         | `cores` | Number of processor cores (vCPUs). |
         | `mode` | Disk access mode.</br>– `READ_ONLY`: Read access.</br>– `READ_WRITE`: Read and write access. |
         | `image_id` | ID of the public image. |
         | `type_id` | Disk type. |

         | `network_id` | The `default-net` ID. |
         | `primary_v4_address_spec` | IPv4 specification. You can allow public access to group instances by specifying the IP version for the public IP address. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/instance-template.md#instance-template). |
         | `scheduling_policy` | Scheduling policy configuration. |
         | `preemptible` | A flag that enables the creation of [preemptible instances](../../concepts/preemptible-vm.md). If the value is `true`, a preemptible instance is created, if `false` (default), a regular instance is created.<br>When creating a preemptible instance group, keep in mind that the instances will terminate after 24 hours of continuous operation or earlier. It's possible that {{ ig-name }} won't be able to restart them immediately due to insufficient resources. This may occur in the event of a drastic increase in {{ yandex-cloud }} computing resource utilization. |
      * [Policies](../../concepts/instance-groups/policies/index.md):

         ```
         deploy_policy:
             max_unavailable: 1
             max_expansion: 0

         ```

         Where:

         | Key | Value |
         ----- | -----
         | `deploy_policy` | [Deployment policy](../../concepts/instance-groups/policies/deploy-policy.md) for instances in the group. |

   1. Create an instance group in the default folder:

      ```
      {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --file specification.yaml
      ```

      This command creates an automatically scaled instance group with the following characteristics:

      * Named `first-autoscaled-group`.
      * Running CentOS 7.
      * In the `default-net` network.
      * In the `{{ region-id }}-a` availability zone.
      * With 2 vCPUs and 2 GB of RAM.
      * With a 32 GB network HDD.

- API

   Use the API [Create](../../api-ref/InstanceGroup/create.md) method.

- {{ TF }}

   If you don't have {{ TF }}, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of resources that you want to create:

      {% note info %}

      If you already have suitable resources, such as a service account, cloud network, and subnet, you don't need to describe them again. Use their names and IDs in the appropriate parameters.

      {% endnote %}

      For more information about resources that you can create with {{ TF }}, please see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/).

   1. Make sure that the configuration files are correct.

      1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run the check using the command:

         ```
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal displays a list of created resources and their parameters. If there are errors in the configuration, {{ TF }} points them out.

   1. Deploy the cloud resources.

      1. If the configuration doesn't contain any errors, run the command:

         ```
         terraform apply
         ```

      1. Confirm that you want to create the resources.

      Afterwards, all the necessary resources are created in the specified folder. You can check that the resources are there with the correct settings using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
