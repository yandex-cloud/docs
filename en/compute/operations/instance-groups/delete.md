title: "How to delete an instance group"
description: "Deleting an instance group is an operation that cannot be canceled or reversed. You cannot restore a deleted group. Along with the group, you delete the {{ network-load-balancer-name }} target group, instances, and disks. To delete an instance group, open the folder page in the management console. Select the {{ compute-full-name }} service. On the Virtual machines page, go to the Instance groups tab. Select Delete."

# Delete an instance group

{% note warning %}

You cannot cancel an instance group's deletion or restore it. Along with the group, you delete the {{ network-load-balancer-name }} or {{ alb-name }} target group, VMs, and disks. You cannot delete an instance group if it is a target group for a load balancer ({{ network-load-balancer-name }}) or a backend group ({{ alb-name }}).

{% endnote %}

To delete an instance group:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), open the folder with the appropriate instance group.
   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_compute }}**.
   1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../../_assets/compute/vm-group-pic.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.switch_groups }}**.
   1. In the line with the appropriate instance group, click ![image](../../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.button_action-delete }}**.
   1. In the window that opens, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.popup-confirm_button_delete }}**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View a description of the CLI instance group delete command below:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-compute-ig }} delete --help
      ```

   1. Get a list of instance groups in the default folder:

      {% include [instance-group-list](../../../_includes/instance-groups/instance-group-list.md) %}

   1. Select the group `ID` or `NAME` (for example, `first-instance-group`).
   1. Delete the instance group:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-compute-ig }} delete --name first-instance-group
      ```

      {{ ig-name }} will launch the instance deletion process.

- API

   Use the [delete](../../api-ref/InstanceGroup/delete.md) REST API method for the [InstanceGroup](../../api-ref/InstanceGroup/index.md) resource or the [InstanceGroupService/Delete](../../api-ref/grpc/instance_group_service.md#Delete) gRPC API call.

   To request the list of available instance groups, use the [listInstances](../../api-ref/InstanceGroup/listInstances.md) REST API method or the [InstanceGroupService/ListInstances](../../api-ref/grpc/instance_group_service.md#ListInstances) gRPC API call.

- {{ TF }}

   For more information about {{ TF }}, [see our documentation](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   If you created an instance group using {{ TF }}, you can delete it:
   1. In the command line, go to the directory with the {{ TF }} configuration file.
   1. Delete the resources using this command:

      ```bash
      terraform destroy
      ```

      {% note alert %}

      {{ TF }} deletes all the resources that you created in the current configuration, such as clusters, networks, subnets, and instances.

      {% endnote %}

   1. Type `yes` and press **Enter**.
