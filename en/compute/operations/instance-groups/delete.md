# Delete an instance group

{% note important %}

Deleting an instance group is an operation that cannot be canceled or reversed. You cannot restore a deleted group. Along with the group, you delete the {{ load-balancer-name }} target group, instances, and disks.

{% endnote %}

To delete an instance group:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. Open the folder page in the management console.

  1. Select **{{ compute-full-name }}**.

  1. On the **Virtual machines** page, go to the **Instance groups** tab.

  1. Click ![image](../../../_assets/vertical-ellipsis.svg) for the group you want to delete and select **Delete**.

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. See the description of the CLI's delete instance group command:

      ```
      $ {{ yc-compute-ig }} delete --help
      ```

  1. Get a list of instance groups in the default folder:

      {% include [instance-group-list](../../../_includes/instance-groups/instance-group-list.md) %}

  1. Select the `ID` or `NAME` of the group (for example, `first-fixed-group`).

  1. Delete the instance group:

      ```
      $ {{ yc-compute-ig }} delete --name first-fixed-group
      ```

      {{ ig-name }} starts the operation to delete the instance group.

- API

  Use the [delete](../../api-ref/InstanceGroup/delete.md) API method.

  To request a list of available groups, use the [listInstances](../../api-ref/InstanceGroup/listInstances.md).

{% endlist %}
