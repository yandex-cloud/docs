# Creating a fixed-size instance group with an L7 network load balancer

You can create a fixed-size [instance group](../../concepts/instance-groups/index.md) integrated with [{{ alb-full-name }}](../../../application-load-balancer/index.yaml). A {{ alb-name }} target group will be automatically created along with the instance group. You can link it to your load balancer and distribute the load across the instances in the group at the application level. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/balancers.md).

   ```

   1. Create an instance group in the default folder:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --file specification.yaml
      ```

      This command creates a group of three similar instances with the following configuration:
      * Named `first-fixed-group-with-l7-balancer`.
      * Running CentOS 7.
      * In the `default-net` network.
      * In the `{{ region-id }}-a` availability zone.
      * With 2 vCPUs and 2 GB of RAM.
      * With a 32 GB network HDD.
      * With a target group named `first-target-group`.

   After that, you can add the `first-target-group` target group to a [new](../../../application-load-balancer/operations/backend-group-create.md) or [existing group of {{ alb-name }} backends](../../../application-load-balancer/operations/backend-group-update.md), a backend group to a [new](../../../application-load-balancer/operations/http-router-create.md) or [existing HTTP router](../../../application-load-balancer/operations/http-router-update.md), and a router to a [new](../../../application-load-balancer/operations/application-load-balancer-create.md) or [existing L7 load balancer](../../../application-load-balancer/operations/application-load-balancer-update.md).

      {% note info %}

      If you already have suitable resources, such as a service account, cloud network, and subnet, you do not need to describe them again. Use their names and IDs in the appropriate parameters.

      {% endnote %}

      For more information on resources that you can create with {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/).
   1. Make sure the configuration files are valid.
      1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run the check using this command:

         ```bash
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal will display a list of created resources and their parameters. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.
   1. Deploy cloud resources.
      1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

         ```bash
         terraform apply
         ```

      1. Confirm that you want to create the resources.

      All the resources you need will then be created in the specified folder. You can check that the resources are there and their settings are correct using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
