# Start an instance group

When an instance group is started, all its stopped instances are started. You can start a single instance for troubleshooting purposes, for example, but to enable [automatic recovery](../../concepts/instance-groups/autohealing.md) and [scaling](../../concepts/instance-groups/scale.md), you need to start an entire group.

{% note warning %}

If an instance group is stopped by {{ yandex-cloud }} because it was blocked for failure to pay, the instance group can be started again only after the block is removed.

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), open the folder with the appropriate instance group.
   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_compute }}**.
   1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../../_assets/compute/vm-group-pic.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.switch_groups }}**.
   1. In the line with the appropriate instance group, click ![image](../../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.button_action-start }}**.
   1. In the window that opens, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.popup-confirm_button_start }}**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View a description of the CLI instance group start command below:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-compute-ig }} start --help
      ```

   1. Get a list of instance groups in the default folder:

      {% include [instance-group-list.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/instance-group-list.md) %}

   1. Select the group `ID` or `NAME` (for example, `first-instance-group`).
   1. Start an instance group in the default folder:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-compute-ig }} start first-instance-group
      ```

      {{ ig-name }} will begin starting instances in the group. Once all instances are started, the group status switches to `ACTIVE`.

- API

   You can start an instance group using the [start](../../api-ref/InstanceGroup/start.md) REST API method for the [InstanceGroup](../../api-ref/InstanceGroup/index.md) resource or the [InstanceGroupService/Start](../../api-ref/grpc/instance_group_service.md#Start) gRPC API call.

   To request the list of available instance groups, use the [listInstances](../../api-ref/InstanceGroup/listInstances.md) REST API method or the [InstanceGroupService/ListInstances](../../api-ref/grpc/instance_group_service.md#ListInstances) gRPC API call.
