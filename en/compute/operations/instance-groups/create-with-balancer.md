# Creating a fixed-size instance group with a network load balancer

You can create a group of fixed-size instances along with a network load balancer that will evenly distribute the load across cloud resources. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../load-balancer/concepts/index.md) in the {{ load-balancer-full-name }} documentation.

To create an instance group with a load balancer:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create an instance group.

  1. Select **{{ compute-full-name }}**.

  1. On the **Virtual machines** page, go to the **Instance groups** tab.

  1. Click **Create group**.

  1. In the **Basic parameters** section:

      - Enter the name and description of the group.

          {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

      - Select a service account from the list or create a new one. Service accounts must have the `{{ roles-editor }}` role to create, update, and delete instances in a group.

  1. In the **Allocation** section, select the desired availability zones. Group instances may reside in different availability zones and regions. [Learn more about Yandex.Cloud geography](../../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).

  1. In the **Instance template** section, click **Set** to set the basic instance configuration:

      - Select a public [image](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md).

      - In the **Disks** section:

          - Select the [disk type](../../concepts/disk.md#disks_types).

          - Specify the disk size.

              To add more disks, click **Add disk**.

      - Under **Computing resources**:

          - Choose the [platform](../../concepts/vm-platforms.md).

          - Specify the [guaranteed share](../../concepts/performance-levels.md), the necessary number of vCPUs, and the amount of RAM.

      - Under **Network settings**:

          - Select the [cloud network](../../concepts/vm.md#network) and the subnet. If the necessary subnet is not in the list, [create it](../../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md).

          - Specify if a public IP address is required.

      - In the **Access** section, specify the data required to access the VM:

          - Enter the username in the **Login** field.

          - Under **SSH key**, paste the contents of the public key file. [Create](../vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys) a key pair for connecting to an instance over SSH on your own.

      - Click **Add**.

  1. Under **Allow when creating and updating**, specify:

      - The number of instances that can be additionally allocated in order to expand the group size.

      - The number of instances the group size can be reduced by.

      - The number of instances that can be created simultaneously.

      - The number of instances that can be deleted simultaneously.

          For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/policies.md#deploy-policy).

  1. In the **Scalability** section:

      - Select the [scaling type](../../concepts/instance-groups/scale.md). Currently, you can only create fixed-size groups.

      - Specify the group size.

  1. Under **Integration with {{ load-balancer-name }}**, toggle the switch to the right of the **Create target group** field.

  1. Enter a custom name and description of the target group.

  1. Click **Create**.

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. See the description of the CLI's create instance group command:

      ```
      $ {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --help
      ```

  1. Check whether there are networks in the folder:

      ```
      $ yc vpc network list
      ```

      If there aren't any, [create the necessary networks](../../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) in {{ vpc-short-name }}.

  1. Select one of the [public images](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md) (for example, CentOS 7).

      {% include [standard-images.md](../../../_includes/standard-images.md) %}

  1. Create a YAML file with any name (for example, `specification.yaml`).

  1. In the created file, indicate the following:

          ```
          name: first-fixed-group

  1. Create an instance group in the default folder:

      ```
      $ {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --file specification.yaml
      ```

      This command creates a group of three similar instances with the following characteristics:
      - Named `first-fixed-group-with-balancer`.
      - Running CentOS 7.
      - In the `default-net` network.
      - In the `ru-central1-a` availability zone.
      - With a single core and 4 GB RAM.
      - With a 32 GB network HDD.
      - With a target group named `first-target-group`.

  1. Create a [load balancer](../../../load-balancer/operations/load-balancer-create.md) and add the `first-target-group` target group to it .

  Use the [create](../../api-ref/InstanceGroup/create.md) API method.
