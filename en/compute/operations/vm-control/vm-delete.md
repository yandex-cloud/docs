# Deleting a VM

{% note warning %}

Deleting a VM is an operation that cannot be canceled or reversed. You cannot restore a deleted VM.

{% endnote %}

{% include [disk-auto-delete](../../_includes_service/disk-auto-delete.md) %}

If previously created disks are attached to the VM, they will be detached when the VM is deleted. The disk data will be preserved and you will be able to attach these disks to another VM in the future.
