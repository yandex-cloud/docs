# Stopping, starting, or restarting a VM

## Stop {#stop}

The **Stop** command shuts down the VM. After the VM is shut down, its status changes to `STOPPED`. While the VM is stopped, no fee is charged for it.

You can enable the VM at any time to continue working with it. All data and changes you've made are saved.

Some VM parameters (such as its boot disk) can only be modified when the VM is stopped.

To stop a VM:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder the VM belongs to.
   1. Select **{{ compute-name }}**.
   1. To stop a single VM, select the machine → click ![image](../../../_assets/options.svg) → select **Stop**.

      To do this with multiple VMs, select the VMs you need to stop from the list → click **Stop** at the bottom of the screen → confirm the action.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. See the description of the CLI's stop VM command:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance stop --help
      ```

   1. Get a list of all VMs in the default folder:

      {% include [compute-instance-list](../../_includes_service/compute-instance-list.md) %}

   1. Select the VM `ID` or `NAME` (for example, `first-instance`).
   1. Stop the VM:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance stop first-instance
      ```

{% endlist %}

## Start {#start}

The **Start** command starts a previously stopped VM. After the VM is started, its status changes to `RUNNING`, and the operating system starts loading. From this point on, you will be charged for using the VM.

To start a VM:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder the VM belongs to.
   1. Select **{{ compute-name }}**.
   1. To start a single VM, select the machine → click ![image](../../../_assets/options.svg) → select **Start**.

      To do this with multiple VMs, select the VMs you need to stop from the list → click **Start** at the bottom of the screen → confirm the action.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. See the description of the CLI's start VM command:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance start --help
      ```

   1. Get a list of all VMs in the default folder:

      {% include [compute-instance-list](../../_includes_service/compute-instance-list.md) %}

   1. Select the VM `ID` or `NAME` (for example, `first-instance`).
   1. Start the VM:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance start first-instance
      ```

{% endlist %}

## Restart {#restart}

The **Restart** command restarts a VM.

To restart a VM:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder the VM belongs to.
   1. Select **{{ compute-name }}**.
   1. To restart a single VM, select the machine → click ![image](../../../_assets/options.svg) → select **Restart**.

      To do this with multiple VMs, select the VMs you need to stop from the list → click **Restart** at the bottom of the screen → confirm the action.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. See the description of the CLI's restart VM command:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance restart --help
      ```

   1. Get a list of all VMs in the default folder:

      {% include [compute-instance-list](../../_includes_service/compute-instance-list.md) %}

   1. Select the VM `ID` or `NAME` (for example, `first-instance`).
   1. Restart the VM:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance restart first-instance
      ```
