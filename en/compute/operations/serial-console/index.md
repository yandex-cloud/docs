# Getting started with the serial console

The serial console allows you to access a VM regardless of the network or OS status. For example, you can use the console for troubleshooting VM issues or when there are problems with SSH access.

Serial console access is disabled by default.

{% include [sc-warning](../../../_includes/compute/serial-console-warning.md) %}

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

Before you enable serial console access on a VM:

1. Prepare the key pair (public and private keys) for SSH access to the VM. The serial console authenticates users via SSH keys.

1. Create a text file (for example, `sshkeys.txt`) and specify the following:

   ```txt
   <username>:<user's public SSH key>
   ```

   Example of a text file for `yc-user`:

   ```txt
   yc-user:ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza......OjbSMRX yc-user@example.com
   ```

   By default, a user's SSH keys are stored in the `~/.ssh` directory of this user. You can get a public key by running `cat ~/.ssh/<public key name>.pub`.

## Enabling the console when creating a VM from a public image {#turn-on-for-new-instance}

To enable access to the serial console when creating a VM, set the `serial-port-enable` parameter in the metadata to `1`.

{% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

{% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

{% list tabs %}

- Linux

   1. View a description of the CLI create VM command:

      ```bash
      yc compute instance create --help
      ```

   1. Select a public [image](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md) based on a Linux OS (such as Ubuntu).

      {% include [standard-images](../../../_includes/standard-images.md) %}

   1. Create a VM in the default folder:

      ```bash
      yc compute instance create \
        --name first-instance \
        --zone {{ region-id }}-a \
        --network-interface subnet-name=default-a,nat-ip-version=ipv4 \
        --create-boot-disk image-folder-id=standard-images,image-family=ubuntu-1604-lts \
        --metadata-from-file ssh-keys=sshkeys.txt \
        --metadata serial-port-enable=1
      ```

      This command will create a VM:
      * With Ubuntu.
      * Named `first-instance`.
      * In the `{{ region-id }}-a` zone.
      * With the serial console active.

      A user named `yc-user` will be automatically created in the VM's OS with the specified public key.


{% endlist %}

## Enabling the console when updating a VM {#turn-on-for-current-instance}

To enable access to the serial console when updating a VM, set the `serial-port-enable` parameter in the metadata to `1`.

{% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

{% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

1. Get a list of VMs in the default folder:

   {% include [compute-instance-list](../../_includes_service/compute-instance-list.md) %}

1. Select the VM `ID` or `NAME` (for example, `first-instance`).

1. Set `serial-port-enable=1` in the VM metadata:

   ```bash
   yc compute instance add-metadata \
     --name first-instance \
     --metadata-from-file ssh-keys=sshkeys.txt \
     --metadata serial-port-enable=1
   ```

   The command will start activating the serial console on the VM named `first-instance`.

## Configuring a VM for serial port access {#configuration}

To configure access via the serial console, a virtual machine must have a public IP address. You can look up the address in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) in the **Compute Cloud** section on the **Virtual machines** page. If you created a virtual machine without a public IP address, you can [assign it one](../vm-control/vm-attach-public-ip.md). Once the configuration is complete, you can release the address. You do not need it for connections via the serial console.

For the serial console to be available from the OS, the OS must be configured properly:
* [Linux](#linux-configuration)

### Linux {#linux-configuration}

To connect to the Linux serial console, make sure that [password authentication is disabled for SSH](#ssh-pass-off) and [set a password](#create-pass) for the appropriate OS user, if necessary.

#### Disable SSH password authentication {#ssh-pass-off}

{% include [vm-connect-ssh-linux-note](../../../_includes/vm-connect-ssh-linux-note.md) %}

If you use your own image, make sure that SSH access with your username and password is disabled.

To disable SSH password authentication:
1. Open the configuration file on the SSH server (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config` by default). Only a superuser has read and write access to the file.
1. Set the `PasswordAuthentication` option to `no`.
1. Restart the SSH server:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

#### Create a password for the Linux user {#create-pass}

Sometimes an OS might request user credentials to access the VM. Before connecting to such VMs, create a local password for the default user.

To create a local password, use the CLI.

{% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

{% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

1. Get a list of VMs in the default folder:

   {% include [compute-instance-list](../../_includes_service/compute-instance-list.md) %}

1. Select the VM `ID` or `NAME` (for example, `first-instance`).

1. Get the public IP address of the VM.

   ```bash
   yc compute instance get first-instance
   ```

   In the command output, find the address of the VM in the `one_to_one_nat` section:

   ```bash
   ...
   one_to_one_nat:
     address: <public IP address>
     ip_version: IPV4
   ...
   ```

1. Connect to the VM. For more information, see [{#T}](../vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect).

1. Create a local password. In Linux, you can set a password using the `passwd` command:

   ```bash
   sudo passwd <username>
   ```

   Example for `yc-user`:

   ```bash
   sudo passwd yc-user
   ```

1. Terminate the SSH session with the `exit` command.
