# Creating a VM from a public DSVM image

Create a DSVM [virtual machine](../../concepts/vm.md) using {{ compute-name }} from the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console and connect to the VM over SSH.

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin-linux](../../../_includes/compute/before-you-begin-linux.md) %}

## Creating a VM from a public DSVM image {#create-dsvm}

{% include [create-instance-via-console-dsvm](../../_includes_service/create-instance-via-console-dsvm.md) %}

## Connecting to a VM over SSH {#first-login}

You can connect to a VM using the SSH protocol when it is running (the VM's status is `RUNNING`). You can use the `ssh` utility in Linux or macOS, or [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) in Windows.

Read more about SSH connections in [Connecting to a VM](../../quickstart/quick-create-linux.md#connect-to-vm).

When connected, in the welcome message you see the commands to activate the environment and run [{{ jlab }} Notebook](http://jupyter.org/index.html) and [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):
