# Creating a VM on a dedicated host

A created VM will be linked to the host selected from a group of hosts. When the VM is stopped, it won't be available on the host, and when it's restarted, it will be linked to the same host from the group.

To create a VM on a dedicated host, follow these steps:

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. View a description of any CLI command using the `--help` flag. For example:

     ```bash
     yc compute host-type --help
     ```
  
  1. See the list of available dedicated host types:

     ```bash
     yc compute host-type list
     ```

     Execution result:

     ```bash
     +---------------------+-------+--------------+
     |         ID          | CORES |    MEMORY    |
     +---------------------+-------+--------------+
     | intel-6230-с66-m454 |    66 | 487478788096 |
     +---------------------+-------+--------------+
     ```

  1. Create a group of dedicated hosts of the selected type. A group may contain one or more hosts.

     ```bash
     yc compute host-group create \
       --fixed-size 2 \
       --type intel-6230-с66-m454 \
       --zone ru-central1-a
     ```

     Where:
     * `fixed-size`: The number of dedicated hosts in the group.
     * `type`: The type of dedicated hosts.
     * `zone`: The [availability zone](../../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).

     Command execution result:

     ```bash
     done (5s)
     id: fhm123hj4l56abcg10qf
     folder_id: m4n56op78mev0cljderg
     created_at: "2020-10-13T07:54:08Z"
     zone_id: ru-central1-a
     status: READY
     type_id: intel-6230-с66-m454
     maintenance_policy: RESTART
     scale_policy:
       fixed_scale:
         size: "2"
     ```

  1. View the IDs of the dedicated hosts in the group and select the host to create your VM on:

     ```bash
     yc compute host-group list-hosts fhm123hj4l56abcg10qf
     ```

     Command execution result:

     ```bash
     +----------------------+----------------------+
     |          ID          |      SERVER ID       |
     +----------------------+----------------------+
     | fhm1ab2mhnf3cd1610f5 | fhmlabct12vp3de45728 |
     | fhmabcun12kbbvhdeug3 | fhm1a2bcsl13ide4cqp2 |
     +----------------------+----------------------+
     ```

  1. Create a VM that is linked to a dedicated host.

     For more information about how to create a VM, see [Creating VMs](../../operations/index.md#vm-create)

     ```bash
     yc compute instance create \
       --host-id fhm1ab2mhnf3cd1610f5 \
       --network-interface subnet-name=network-ru-central1-a \
       --zone ru-central1-a
     ```

     Where:
     * `host-id`: ID of the dedicated host.
     * `subnet-name`: Name of the selected subnet.
     * `zone`: Availability zone that corresponds to the selected subnet.

     Command execution result:

     ```bash
     done (41s)
     id: fhm1abc23407de854r9e
     folder_id: m4n56op78mev0cljderg
     created_at: "2020-10-13T08:00:55Z"
     zone_id: ru-central1-a
     ...
     placement_policy:
       host_affinity_rules:
       - key: yc.hostId
         op: IN
         values:
         - fhm1ab2mhnf3cd1610f5
     ```

- API

  1. Select the host type using the [list](../../api-ref/HostType/list.md) method for the `HostType` resource.

  1. Create a group of dedicated hosts using the [create](../../api-ref/HostGroup/create.md) method for the `HostGroup` resource.

  1. Check out the IDs of the dedicated hosts in the group using the [listHosts](../../api-ref/HostGroup/listHosts.md) method for the `HostGroup` resource.

  1. Create a VM on a dedicated host using the [create](../../api-ref/Instance/create.md) method for the `Instance` resource.
