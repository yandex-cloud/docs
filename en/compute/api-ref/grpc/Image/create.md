Description of the image.

The maximum string length in characters is 256. ||
|| labels | **object** (map<**string**, **string**>)

Resource labels as `key:value` pairs.

No more than 64 per resource. The maximum string length in characters for each value is 63. Each value must match the regular expression ` [-_./\@0-9a-z]* `. The string length in characters for each key must be 1-63. Each key must match the regular expression ` [a-z][-_./\@0-9a-z]* `. ||
|| family | **string**

The name of the image family to which this image belongs. For more information, see [Image family](/docs/compute/concepts/image#family).

To get an information about the most recent image from a family, use a [ImageService.GetLatestByFamily](/docs/compute/api-ref/grpc/Image/getLatestByFamily#GetLatestByFamily) request.

Value must match the regular expression ``` |[a-z][-a-z0-9]{1,61}[a-z0-9] ```. ||

License IDs are used to calculate additional charges for the use of the virtual machine.

The correct license ID is generated by the platform. IDs are inherited by new resources created from this resource.

If you know the license IDs, specify them when you create the image.
For example, if you create a disk image using a third-party utility and load it into Object Storage, the license IDs will be lost.
You can specify them in this request.
