# Creating instance groups

Create an instance group using the [Instance Groups](../concepts/instance-groups/index.md) component in the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console.

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

1. Sign in or sign up to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). If you do not yet have an account, go to the management console and follow the instructions.
1. [On the billing page]({{ link-console-billing }}), make sure you linked a [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you do not yet have a billing account, [create one](../../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. If you do not have any folder, [create one](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/create.md).

## Create an instance group {#create-ig}

You can create an automatically scaled group or a group with a fixed number of instances. For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/instance-groups/scale.md).

{% include [warning.md](../../_includes/instance-groups/warning.md) %}

To create an instance group:
1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select a folder to create your instance group in.
1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_compute }}**.
1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/compute/vm-group-pic.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.switch_groups }}**.
1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.button_create }}**.
1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_base }}**:
   * Enter a name and description of the instance group. The naming requirements are as follows:

      {% include [name-format](../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

      {% include [name-fqdn](../../_includes/compute/name-fqdn.md) %}

   * Select a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) from the list or create a new one. To be able to create, update, and delete group instances, assign the `editor` role to the service account. In {{ ig-name }}, all operations are performed on behalf of a service account.

1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_allocation }}** section, select the desired availability zones. Group instances may reside in different availability zones and regions. You can learn more about {{ yandex-cloud }} availability zones [here](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).
1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_instance }}** section, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.button_instance_empty-create }}** to set the base instance configuration:
   * Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_base }}**, enter a description for the base instance.
   * Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_image }}**, select a public image.
   * Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_disk }}**:
      * Select the [disk type](../../compute/concepts/disk.md#disks_types).
      * Specify the disk size.
      * (optional) Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.label_add-disk }}** to add more disks.
   * Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_platform }}**:
      * Choose a [platform](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md).
      * Specify the [guaranteed share](../../compute/concepts/performance-levels.md) and the required number of vCPUs, as well as the amount of RAM.
      * (optional) Specify that the instance must be [preemptible](../../compute/concepts/preemptible-vm.md).
   * Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_network }}**:
      * Select a [cloud network](../../compute/concepts/vm.md#network) and [subnet](../../compute/concepts/network.md#subnet). If there is no subnet, create one:
         * Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.button_create-subnetwork-new }}**.
         * Enter a name and a description for the new subnet. Specify an availability zone and a CIDR.
         * Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.vpc.create-subnetwork-dialog.button_create }}**.
      * In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.field_instance-group-address }}** field, choose a method for assigning an IP address:
         * `{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.value_address-auto }}`: Assign a random IP address from the {{ yandex-cloud }} IP pool.
         * `{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.value_address-none }}`: Do not assign a public IP address.
      * (optional) Select a [security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md). If there is no security group, create one:
         * Click ![image](../../_assets/plus-sign.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.vpc-security-group-select.label_add-security-group }}**.
         * Enter a name and description for the security group. You will be able to add rules to the security group at a later stage using **{{ vpc-name }}**.
         * Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.create }}**.

         {% include [security-groups-note-vm](../../_includes/vpc/security-groups-note-vm.md) %}

   * Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_access }}**:
      * Select a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) from the list or create a new one.
      * If you selected a Linux-based public image:
         * Enter the username in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.field_user }}** field.
         * In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.field_key }}** field, paste the contents of the public key file. You need to [create](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys) a key pair for the SSH connection yourself.
      * If you selected a Windows-based public image:
         * In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.password }}** field, set a password for the `Administrator` user. The `Administrator` user is created automatically.
      * Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.add }}**.
      * If required, grant access to the [serial console](../operations/serial-console/index.md).
   * Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.button_edit }}**.
1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_deploy }}**, specify:
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.field_deploy-max-expansion }}**: Number of instances that can exceed the group size.
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.field_deploy-max-unavailable }}**: Number of instances the group size can be reduced by.
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.field_deploy-max-creating }}**: Number of instances that can be created simultaneously.
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.field_deploy-startup-duration }}**: Initialization interval following which the virtual machine will begin to handle load.
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.field_deploy-max-deleting }}**: Number of instances you can stop simultaneously.
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.field_deploy-strategy }}**: Instance shut-down strategy: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.value_strategy-proactive }}` or `{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.value_strategy-opportunistic }}`.

      For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/instance-groups/policies/deploy-policy.md).
1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_scale }}**:
   * Select the [scaling type](../../compute/concepts/instance-groups/scale.md).
   * If you selected the `{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.value_scale-fixed }}` type, specify the size of the group.
   * If you selected `{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.value_scale-auto }}`, specify:
      * The minimum number of instances per availability zone.
      * Maximum group size.
      * Utilization measurement period: The period for which utilization measurements should be averaged for each instance in the group.
      * Instance warmup period: The period during which the created instance is not taken into account when measuring the average load on the group.
      * Stabilization period: The interval during which the required number of instances in the group can't be reduced.
      * Initial group size: The number of instances created with the group.
   * If you selected `{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.value_scale-fixed-test-auto }}`, enter group size and autoscaling parameters. For this type, autoscaling works in test mode.
1. If you previously selected `{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.value_scale-auto }}` as your scaling type, under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.label_custom-metrics }}**, specify the target CPU load as a percentage.
1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_ylb }}**:
   * (optional) Click the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.field_target-group-attached }}** toggle. [Target groups](../../network-load-balancer/concepts/target-resources.md) are required for the [network load balancer](../../network-load-balancer/concepts/index.md) to perform its function.
      * Enter a name and description for the target group.
1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.groups.create.section_health-check }}**:
