# Creating a Linux VM

Create a Linux [virtual machine](../concepts/vm.md) using {{ compute-name }} from the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console and connect to it.

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin-linux](../../_includes/compute/before-you-begin-linux.md) %}

## Create a VM {#create-vm}

{% include [create-instance-via-console-linux](../_includes_service/create-instance-via-console-linux.md) %}

## Connect to the VM {#connect-to-vm}

{% include notitle [vm-connect-ssh](../operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) %}

## Configure the serial console {#serial-console}

Using the [serial console](../operations/serial-console/index.md), you can connect to a VM regardless of the network or OS state (for example, if there are SSH loading or access issues).

Make sure you configure access to the VM via the serial console in advance.

## Delete the VM {#delete-vm}

If you no longer plan to use a virtual machine, [delete it](../operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md).

## What's next {#what-is-next}

* Watch [tutorials for creating web services in {{ yandex-cloud }}](../../tutorials/web/index.md).
* Learn [how to use VMs](../operations/index.md).
* Learn [how to create a VM with a GPU](../operations/vm-create/create-vm-with-gpu.md).
* Read [answers to frequently asked questions](../qa/general.md).
