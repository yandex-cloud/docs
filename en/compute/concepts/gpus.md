# Graphics accelerators (GPUs)

{{ compute-full-name }} provides graphics accelerators (GPUs) as part of graphics cards. GPUs outperform vCPUs in processing certain types of data and can be used for complex computing.

{{ compute-short-name }} uses [NVIDIA® Tesla® V100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-v100/) GPUs with 32 GB HBM2.

The NVIDIA® Tesla® V100 graphics card contains 5120 CUDA® cores that perform [high performance computing](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/high-performance-computing/) (HPC), and 640 Tensor cores for deep learning (DL) tasks.

Graphics accelerators are also suitable for machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and 3D rendering tasks.

You can control a GPU and RAM directly from your VM.

## VM configurations {#config}

Available configurations of computing resources:

* Intel Broadwell with NVIDIA® Tesla® V100 (`gpu-standard-v1`):

  | Number of GPUs | Number of vCPUs | RAM, GB |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | 8 | 96 |
  | 2 | 16 | 192 |
  | 4 | 32 | 384 |

* Intel Cascade Lake with NVIDIA® Tesla® V100 (`gpu-standard-v2`):

  | Number of GPUs | Number of vCPUs | RAM, GB |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | 8 | 48 |
  | 2 | 16 | 96 |
  | 4 | 32 | 192 |
  | 8 | 64 | 384 |

## Virtual graphics accelerators (vGPUs) {#vgpu}

{{ compute-full-name }} lets you virtualize graphics accelerators (GPUs). Virtual GPUs are created based on [NVIDIA® vGPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/virtualization/) technology.

NVIDIA® vGPU software lets you use cards with GPUs for both graphics and computing tasks on vGPUs. This requires the appropriate [licenses](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/design-visualization/solutions/resources/documents1/Virtual-GPU-Packaging-and-Licensing-Guide.pdf).

To use vGPU technology, you need:

* A VM running on the [platform](#vm-platforms.md) `vgpu-standard-v1` with one of the following images:
  * [Ubuntu 18.04 lts vGPU](https://cloud.yandex.com/marketplace/products/f2e8k6h1vu1rc360rr0h).
  * [Windows Server 2019 Datacenter vGPU](https://cloud.yandex.com/marketplace/products/f2ent6cnb49sf5n9s1u2).
* License to use [NVIDIA® vGPU](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/design-visualization/solutions/resources/documents1/Virtual-GPU-Packaging-and-Licensing-Guide.pdf) technology.
* [NVIDIA® vGPU Software License Server](https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/ls/latest/grid-license-server-user-guide/index.html).

To work with the license, you can:

* Use your current license server.
The current license server must be available over the network from VMs with vGPUs.
* Create a VM with the NVIDIA® vGPU Software License Server in {{ yandex-cloud }}.
For information about how to install and configure the license server, see the [NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/ls/latest/grid-license-server-user-guide/index.html#installing-nvidia-grid-license-server).

### Configurations of VMs with vGPUs {#config-vgpu}

The following configuration is available for VMs with vGPUs:

* Intel Broadwell with NVIDIA® vGPU Tesla® V100 8G (`vgpu-standard-v1`):

  | Number of vGPUs | Number of vCPUs | RAM, GB | GPU RAM, GB |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | 4 | 12 | 8 |
