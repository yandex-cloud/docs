# vCPU performance levels

Choose the vCPU performance level when creating a VM. It sets the guaranteed vCPU share to be allocated to the VM. Available configurations of computing resources may change for different levels, depending on the selected [platform](vm-platforms.md).

* VMs with a guaranteed vCPU share below 100% are designed for running apps that do not require high performance. These VMs are also cheaper.
* VMs with a 100% guaranteed vCPU share are designed for running apps that require high performance.

The available disk space does not depend on the VM performance level. For limitations, see [{#T}](limits.md).

Minimum and maximum configurations:

{% note info %}

Minimum configurations are specified for the 5% performance level, and maximum configurations â€” for that of 100%.
