# Images

An _image_ is a complete copy of the file system structure and data on a disk.

It is designed to quickly create a data disk, primarily, a VM boot disk. Images can be used for distributing software, such as OS distributions or disks with pre-installed software.

{% include [end-of-life](../../_includes/compute/end-of-life.md) %}

{% note tip %}

To regularly back up your data on disks, use [snapshots](snapshot.md).

{% endnote %}

You can create an image from a disk, snapshot, or another image. If you have an image file, you can [import](../operations/image-create/upload.md) it to {{ yandex-cloud }}. To create a Windows disk image, follow [this guide](../../microsoft/prepare-image.md).

When you create a Windows boot disk image, specify this in the operating system type. This is important for proper CPU emulation and billing.

## Image family {#family}

If you regularly update your images, you can group them into families. You can use the family name to find the latest image in the family.

{% note warning %}

All images belonging to the same family must be in the same folder.

{% endnote %}

> Let's assume you want to upload an image of your operating system to {{ yandex-cloud }}. When creating an image, specify a family, such as `best-linux-distro`. This will allow other users to get the latest version of your operating system by specifying the family and image folder ID in the [request](../api-ref/Image/getLatestByFamily.md).

## Public images {#public}

Public images are, for example, [products and solutions from {{ marketplace-full-name }}](/marketplace).

You can learn how to get a list of public images [here](../operations/images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md).

To make your image available to other {{ yandex-cloud }} users, grant them public access to it. To do this, assign the `{{ roles-image-user }}` [role](../security/) to the `{{ subjects-allAuthenticatedUsers }}` system group. However, the `{{ roles-image-user }}` role does not grant permission to delete or edit your image.

## Images optimized for deployment {#images-optimized-for-deployment}

_The feature is at the [Preview](../../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage._

An image can be optimized for deploying a large number of VMs. You can create VMs from optimized images much faster than from conventional ones: this enables you to instantly expand your computing power and use tools from your own image.

Fast deployment is achieved by using multiple layers for storing data in a storage. The first layer stores the image source data, while the second one stores user data. When creating VM disks from optimized images, the first layer is reused rather than copied to a new storage location every time. Disks created from optimized images run on VMs in the same way as disks created from regular images: they can be used as boot disks and are fully available for data storage. The performance of these disks does not differ from that of regular ones.

Regular images from {{ marketplace-name }} are already optimized for deployment. To optimize your image, select the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.images.popup-upload_field_pooled }}** option when uploading the image.

By default, optimized images have a zero [quota](../concepts/limits.md#compute-quotas). To increase the [quota]({{ link-console-quotas }}), contact [support](../../support/overview.md).
