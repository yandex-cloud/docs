# Scaling policy

When creating an instance group, you can choose how to increase and decrease the number of instances in the group.

The policy is defined in the `scale-policy` key in the YAML file.

## fixed_scale {#fixed-scale-policy}

The `fixed_scale` key defines a group of fixed-size instances. The size of the group is defined in the `size` key. You can create a group with the desired number of instances within the available [quotas and limits](../../limits.md).

Example of a YAML file entry:

```yaml
...
scale_policy:
    fixed_scale:
        size: 3
...
```

Keys:

| Key | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| `fixed_scale` | A group of fixed-size instances. |
| `size`* | Number of instances in the group.<br>Valid values are from 0 to 100. |

\* Required field.

## auto_scale {#auto-scale-policy}

The `auto_scale` key defines automatically scalable instance group. The initial size of the group is defined in the `initial_size` key. You can create a group with the desired number of instances within the available [quotas and limits](../../limits.md).

Example of a YAML file entry:

```yaml
scale_policy:
    auto_scale:
        initial_size: 5
        max_size: 15
        min_zone_size: 3
        measurement_duration: 30
        warmup_duration: 60
        stabilization_duration: 120
        cpu_utilization_rule:
            utilization_target: 75
```

Keys:

| Key | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| `auto_scale` | An automatically scaled instance group. |
| `initial_size`* | Initial number of instances in the group.<br>Valid values are from 0 to 100. |
| `max_size` | Maximum number of instances in the group.<br>Valid values are from 0 to 100. |
| `min_zone_size` | Minimum number of instances in one availability zone.<br>Valid values are from 0 to 100. |
| `measurement_duration`* | Time in seconds allotted for averaging metrics based on CPU load. If the average load at the end of the interval is higher than `cpu_utilization_rule.utilization_target`, {{ ig-name }} increases the number of instances in the group.<br>Valid values are from 60 to 600 seconds. |
| `warmup_duration`* | The warmup time of the instance. During this time, traffic is sent to the instance, but CPU utilization metrics aren't considered.<br>Valid values are from 0 to 600 seconds. |
| `stabilization_duration`* | The minimum amount of time to monitor CPU utilization before {{ ig-name }} can reduce the number of instances in the group. During this time, the group is not resized, even if the average CPU utilization drops below the `cpu_utilization_rule.utilization_target` value.<br>Valid values are from 60 to 1800 seconds. |
| `cpu_utilization_rule`* | Sets the target CPU utilization to run scaling based on the average CPU utilization in the instance group. |
| `utilization_target`* | Target CPU utilization to be supported by {{ ig-name }}.<br>If the average CPU utilization is below the target value, {{ ig-name }} will reduce the number of instances until it reaches `min_zone_size` in each availability zone.<br>If the average CPU utilization is higher than the target value, {{ ig-name }} will create instances until it reaches `max_size`.<br>Valid values are from 10 to 100. |

\* Required field.
