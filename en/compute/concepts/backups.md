# Backups in {{ compute-name }}

Data in images, snapshots, and disks that aren't attached to instances is stored securely and replicated within the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure.

To back up the data from disks attached to an instance, create snapshots of the disks from time to time â€” do this [manually](../operations/disk-control/create-snapshot.md) or automatically, according to the [schedule](snapshot-schedule.md).

You can restore an instance from a snapshot of the disk you need in the following ways:
* Create a new disk from a snapshot, then [attach the created disk](../operations/vm-control/vm-attach-disk.md) to an instance.
* Create a new instance [from a set of snapshots](../operations/vm-create/create-from-snapshots.md). In the operation parameters, you can specify snapshots as both boot and regular disks.
