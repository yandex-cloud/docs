- Management console

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder to create your VM in.
  1. In the list of services, select **{{ compute-name }}**.
  1. Click **Create VM**.
  1. Under **Basic parameters**:
      * Enter a name and description for the VM. Naming requirements:

          {% include [name-format](../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

          {% include [name-fqdn](../../_includes/compute/name-fqdn.md) %}

      * Select the [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to host the VM in.
  1. Under **Image/boot disk selection**, on the **{{ marketplace-name }}** tab, select an [image](../operations/images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md) for a **DSVM**.
  1. (optional) If you want to add additional disks to the instance, [select them](../operations/vm-create/create-from-disks.md) in the **Disks** section.
  1. (optional) If you want to add more file storages to the VM, add them under **File storages**. [Create](../operations/filesystem/create.md) the storages first.
  1. Under **Computing resources**:
      * Choose the [platform](../concepts/vm-platforms.md).
      * Specify the [guaranteed share](../../compute/concepts/performance-levels.md) and the necessary number of vCPUs and amount of RAM.
      * If necessary, make your VM [preemptible](../concepts/preemptible-vm.md).
      * (optional) Enable a [software-accelerated network](../concepts/software-accelerated-network.md).
  1. Under **Network settings**:
      * Specify the subnet ID or select a [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) from the list. You can select the search scope: in the current folder or in all folders. If you don't have a network, click **Create network** to create one:
          * In the window that opens, enter the folder to host the new network, as well as the network name.
          * Enable the option **Create subnets**: each network must have at least one [subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).
          * Click **Create**.
      * In the **Public IP** field, choose a method for assigning an IP address:
          * **Auto**: Assign a random IP address from the {{ yandex-cloud }} IP pool.
          * **List**: Select a public IP address from the list of previously reserved static addresses. For more information, see [{#T}](../../vpc/operations/set-static-ip.md).
          * **No address**: Don't assign a public IP address.
      * (optional) If necessary, enable [DDoS protection](../../vpc/ddos-protection/index.md).
      * Select the [appropriate security groups](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) (if there is no corresponding field, all incoming and outgoing traffic will be allowed for the VM).
  1. Under **Access**, specify the data required to access the VM:
      * (optional) Select or create a [service account](../../iam/concepts/index.md#sa). By using a service account, you can flexibly configure access rights for your resources.
      * Enter the username in the **Login** field.
      * In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the [public key](../operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys) file.
      * (optional) If necessary, enable access to the [serial console](../operations/index.md#serial-console).
  1. Click **Create VM**.

  The virtual machine appears in the list. When a VM is being created, it is assigned an [IP address](../../vpc/concepts/address) and [hostname](../../vpc/concepts/address.md#fqdn) (FQDN).
