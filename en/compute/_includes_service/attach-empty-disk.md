{% note info %}

Empty disks do not have a file system. If you attach an empty disk, [partition and mount](../operations/vm-control/vm-attach-disk.md#mount) it manually. Alternatively, instead of attaching an empty disk, you can [create a snapshot](../operations/disk-control/create-snapshot.md) of the boot disk and [create a VM](../operations/vm-create/create-from-snapshots.md) based on the snapshot.
