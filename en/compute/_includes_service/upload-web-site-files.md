1. You can get the IP address of an instance under **Network** on the instance page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM over SSH. You can use the `ssh` tool in Linux and macOS or [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) for Windows.

   The recommended authentication method when connecting over SSH is using a key pair.  Don't forget to set up the created key pair: the private key must match the public key sent to the VM.

1. Grant your user write access to the directory `/var/www/html`:

   ```
   sudo setfacl -m u:<your user's name>:w /var/www/html
   ```

1. Upload the website files to the VM over SCP.

   {% list tabs %}

   - Linux/macOS

     Use the `scp` command-line utility:

     ```
     scp -r <path to the file directory> <your user's name>@<VM's IP address>:/var/www/html
     ```

   - Windows

     Use the [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) program to copy the local file directory to the `/var/www/html` directory on the VM.
