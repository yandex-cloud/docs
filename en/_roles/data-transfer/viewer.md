The `data-transfer.viewer` role allows you to view information on the relevant [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder), [endpoints](../../data-transfer/concepts/index.md#endpoint), and [transfers](../../data-transfer/concepts/index.md#transfer), as well as on Data Transfer [quotas](../../data-transfer/concepts/limits.md#dataproc-quotas).

This role also includes the `data-transfer.auditor` permissions.

Currently, this role can only be assigned for working with a folder or a cloud.
