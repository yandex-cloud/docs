The `auditor` role grants a permission to read configuration and metadata of any Yandex Cloud resources without any access to data.

For instance, users with this role can:
* View info on a [resource](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md).
* View the resource metadata.
* View the list of operations with a resource.

`auditor` is the most secure role that does not grant any access to the [service](../../overview/concepts/services.md) data. This role suits the users who need minimum access to the Yandex Cloud resources.
