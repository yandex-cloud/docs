The `storage.admin` role is intended for managing Object Storage.

Users with this role can:
* Create [buckets](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) (including publicly accessible ones).
* Delete buckets.
* Assign an [access control list](../../storage/concepts/acl.md) (ACL).
* Manage any bucket [object](../../storage/concepts/object.md).
* Manage any bucket [website](../../storage/concepts/hosting.md).
* Configure other bucket parameters and objects in the bucket.

This role enables the user to grant other users access to a bucket or a specific object in it.

This role can be assigned by the administrator of the cloud (the `admin` role).
