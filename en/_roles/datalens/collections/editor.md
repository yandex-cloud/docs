You can assign the `datalens.collections.editor` role to a collection. It allows you to edit the relevant collection and all its nested collections, workbooks, and all objects within such workbooks. In the DataLens UI, this role is referred to as `Editor`. You may want to only assign this role through the DataLens UI.

Users with this role can:
* View info on the relevant collection and its nested [collections and workbooks](../../../datalens/workbooks-collections/index.md).
* Edit the relevant collection and all its nested collections and workbooks.
* Create copies of the relevant collection and all its nested collections and workbooks.
* Create new collections and workbooks within the relevant collection and all its nested ones.
* View and edit all nested [objects](../../../datalens/concepts/index.md#component-interrelation) of the workbooks related to the appropriate collection and its nested collections.
* View info on the [access permissions](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md) granted for the appropriate collection, as well as for its nested collections and workbooks.

This role also includes the `datalens.collections.viewer` and `datalens.workbooks.editor` permissions.
