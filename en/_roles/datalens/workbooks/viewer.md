You can assign the `datalens.workbooks.viewer` role to a [workbook](../../../datalens/workbooks-collections/index.md). With it, you can view all workbook's nested [objects](../../../datalens/concepts/index.md#component-interrelation) and the info on the [access permissions](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md) granted for such a workbook. In the DataLens UI, this role is referred to as `Viewer`. You may want to only assign this role through the DataLens UI.

This role also includes the `datalens.workbooks.limitedViewer` permissions.
