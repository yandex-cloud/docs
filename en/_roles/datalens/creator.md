The `datalens.creator` role grants access to DataLens with a permission to create [workbooks and collections](../../datalens/workbooks-collections/index.md) in the DataLens root. You can view and edit workbooks and collections created by other users only if you have [access permissions](#workbooks-collections-roles) to these workbooks and collections.

This role includes the `datalens.visitor` permissions.
