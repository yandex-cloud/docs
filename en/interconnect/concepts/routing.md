# Routing

When connecting your infrastructure via {{ interconnect-full-name }}, you will need to configure traffic routing to cloud resources or to the internet. This page explains how to manage {{ interconnect-name }} traffic using {{ yandex-cloud }} features.

Example of setting up a connection using {{ interconnect-name }}:

![interconnect-routing](../../_assets/cloud-interconnect/interconnect-routing.svg)

## How {{ interconnect-name }} interacts with {{ vpc-name }} {#interconnect-to-vpc}

In your request for connecting {{ interconnect-name }}, you should specify prefixes of {{ vpc-short-name }} subnets. These prefixes are announced by the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure over BGP to your equipment receiving BGP sessions. In the diagram, this equipment is labeled "Client router".

When using load balancers from [{{ network-load-balancer-full-name }}](../../network-load-balancer/) and [{{ alb-full-name }}](../../application-load-balancer/), their handlers' addresses are announced as IPv4 prefixes with the length of `/32`. This enables you to use load balancers to distribute traffic coming from your networks via {{ interconnect-name }} between {{ yandex-cloud }} availability zones.

IPv4 prefixes passed by your equipment over BGP to {{ yandex-cloud }} enter {{ vpc-short-name }} subnets using the route information redistribution mechanism. They then become available to all virtual machines and internal load balancers within the {{ vpc-short-name }}. For cloud resources to access your corporate infrastructure, no changes to VM routing tables are required.

## How {{ interconnect-name }} interacts with static routes {#interconnect-and-static-routes}

The route to external resources (IPv4 prefixes) from {{ yandex-cloud }} is chosen only by the length of its prefix. A prefix with a length of `/8` indicates the lowest priority of the route, and `/32` the highest.

{% note warning %}

In the same {{ vpc-short-name }} virtual network, do not use static routes with prefixes duplicating the prefixes announced by your equipment to {{ interconnect-name }}. This will result in asymmetric traffic routing.

{% endnote %}

If you need to route some {{ vpc-short-name }} traffic via a static route and some to {{ interconnect-name }}, use unique, non-overlapping IPv4 prefixes and plan the address space of your projects more granularly.

The diagram shows how this approach can be implemented.

* The IPv4 prefix `10.0.0.0/8` is a short summary prefix of all the networks of your infrastructure. Announced over BGP to {{ yandex-cloud }} {{ vpc-short-name }} via {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* A route with the IPv4 prefix `10.20.0.0/24` and next-hop `10.128.0.5` (where `10.128.0.5` is the IP address of a virtual machine with a VPN gateway in {{ yandex-cloud }}) is represented by a static route to the VPN gateway.

With this routing setup, all traffic is routed via {{ interconnect-name }}, except for traffic from the `10.20.0.0/24` subnet, which is sent to the VPN tunnel through the VPN gateway on the {{ yandex-cloud }} side.

## How to reserve {{ interconnect-name }} connections using a VPN {#interconnect-vpn-failover}

To safeguard a {{ interconnect-name }} connection from failure, you can announce a short summary IPv4 prefix from your infrastructure to a VM with a VPN gateway on the {{ yandex-cloud }} side. This prefix automatically receives a higher priority in the {{ vpc-short-name }} and traffic will be routed through {{ interconnect-name }}. When a BGP session fails, a longer prefix through the VPN gateway will be used. Failure will cause the summary IPv4 prefix `10.0.0.0/8` to be deleted from routing tables both from the {{ yandex-cloud }} {{ vpc-short-name }} side and the client router.

The diagram shows how this approach can be implemented.

* The prefixes `10.0.0.0/25` and `10.0.128.0/25` are long subnet prefixes from your data center, announced over BGP to {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* A route with the prefix `10.20.0.0/24` and next-hop `10.128.0.5` (where `10.128.0.5` is the IP address of a virtual machine with a VPN gateway) uses a static route through an IPSec gateway.

With this routing setup, all traffic is routed through a working {{ interconnect-name }} connection. If the connection via {{ interconnect-name }} fails, the BGP session will be interrupted and the`10.0.0.0/25` and `10.0.128.0/25` routes will be removed from the routing tables. This will redirect all traffic to the VPN gateway through the remaining working route `10.20.0.0/24`.

## How to organize private internet access without using {{ yandex-cloud }} {#private-access-to-the-internet}

To connect your cloud resources to the internet via {{ interconnect-name }}, you need to set up route announcement of `0.0.0.0/0` over BGP to {{ yandex-cloud }}. This way traffic from a virtual network connected to {{ interconnect-name }} is unconditionally routed to your equipment. On your side, you can configure traffic filtering rules before sending it to the internet via your own NAT without the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure.

## How {{ interconnect-name }} interacts with NAT on a subnet {#interconnect-and-egress-nat}

With {{ interconnect-name }}, you can enable [egress NAT](../../vpc/operations/enable-nat.md) if the default route `0.0.0.0/0` is not announced over BGP to {{ yandex-cloud }}. If such a route is announced:

* The `enable-nat` function is triggered. The VM's internal IPv4 address is passed to a public IPv4 address on the {{ yandex-cloud }} side.
* The traffic is directed to your equipment (a client router in the diagram), which announced the `0.0.0.0/0` route over BGP. Your equipment starts receiving traffic from VMs' public addresses.

{% note warning %}

Do not use egress NAT on the {{ yandex-cloud }} side when announcing the `0.0.0.0/0` route from your own equipment.

{% endnote %}

## How to manage {{ interconnect-name }} IPv4 routes {#interconnect-routes}

You can use the prefix length to manage IPv4 routes. For example, you can announce long prefixes `10.0.0.0/25` and `10.0.128.0/25` over BGP to one of the points of presence (POP-1), and a short summary prefix `10.0.0.0/24` to POP-2.

The connection through POP-1 will have higher priority than POP-2. Traffic from {{ yandex-cloud }} to the client's infrastructure will be routed through POP-1.

To direct traffic to {{ yandex-cloud }} via POP-2, configure a BGP policy on your router to raise the priority of the necessary IPv4 prefixes using the BGP Local Preference attribute.

At the moment, you can manage traffic sent from {{ yandex-cloud }} to the client's infrastructure only using the prefix length. The current implementation of {{ yandex-cloud }} management protocols doesn't support all BGP attributes for traffic management and does not take into account the value of the BGP AS-PATH attribute (path length) when choosing the shortest route. For that same reason, it's impossible to use the BGP AS-PATH prepend mechanism to manage traffic.

## How to utilize both {{ interconnect-name }} channels in a fault-tolerant scheme {#interconnect-fault-tolerance}

To distribute the load over multiple {{ interconnect-name }} channels, you can announce the same IPv4 prefix, for example, `10.0.0.0/8`, in each of the {{ interconnect-name }} connections in each point of presence. {{ yandex-cloud }} supports ECMP balancing and will distribute traffic between connections within each point of presence.

Note that this balancing mode can lead to asymmetric traffic. As a result, traffic may enter {{ yandex-cloud }} via POP-1 and the response will be received via POP-2. The asymmetry is handled correctly and is acceptable in {{ yandex-cloud }}, but may not be permitted for certain types of equipment on the client side, such as firewalls.

To allow asymmetric traffic from {{ yandex-cloud }}, disable the [RPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-path_forwarding) mechanism. This will enable you to use all active {{ interconnect-name }} connections with a redundant connection via two or more points of presence.

## How {{ interconnect-name }} interacts with security groups {#interconnect-and-security-groups}

Security groups cannot be assigned to resources outside {{ yandex-cloud }}, therefore the correct way to filter traffic is to use IPv4 prefixes rather than links to other security groups.

For example, announce the IPv4 prefix `10.0.0.0/8`, a short summary prefix of all the networks of your data center, over BGP to {{ yandex-cloud }}. Then assign a security group to your cloud resources, with rules allowing access from your data center to the web application via port `443`. The group rules also allow your cloud resources to access resources in your data center on any port.

```
ingress {
      protocol       = "TCP"
      port           = 443
      description    = "Allow ingress from Interconnect to web server"
      v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
    }
      egress {
      protocol       = "ANY"
      description    = "We allow any egress traffic for stage, since we block prod on ingress"
      v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
    }
```

Additionally, you can use more specific rules to allow access to concrete addresses or subnets and ports:

```
ingress {
      protocol       = "TCP"
      port           = 443
      description    = "Allow ingress from Interconnect to web server"
      v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.20.0.5/32"]
    }
      egress {
      protocol       = "TCP"
      port           = 3389
      description    = "Allow RDP to Interconnect server"
      v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.20.0.20/32"]
    }
```
