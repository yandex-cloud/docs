# Bandwidth

Bandwidth, or traffic package, is a unit of {{ interconnect-name }} billing, which is equal to the amount of traffic transmitted at the specified speed per month.

> For example, the traffic package for a speed of 100 Mbit/s will be 30 TB. This is the amount of traffic that can be transferred in a month with 100% utilization of a channel with a bandwidth of 100 Mbit/s.

{% note info %}

* When making a [request for setting up a new trunk](../operations/trunk-prc-add.md#trunk-ticket), specify the traffic package as the required bandwidth in **mbps** (Mbit/s).
* You can change the bandwidth for an existing trunk by making a request to technical support.
