# Trunk connection (L2)

A trunk connection is a type of traffic multiplexing at the second layer of the OSI mode. It uses IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet frame tagging technology. Multiplexing allows passing traffic in several logical data streams in a single [direct physical interface](l1-physical.md). The 802.1Q tag (VLAN Identifier, or VLAN-ID) separates logical streams. The VLAN-ID is 12 bits long, meaning its value can be from 0 to 4095.

{% note warning "Important" %}

In {{ yandex-cloud }}, the possible values of the VLAN-ID are 2â€“4000 inclusive.

At the layer of the trunk connection on the side of the {{ yandex-cloud }} network equipment, there is a transfer rate limit in bits per second and in packets per second both to and from the cloud according to the selected [traffic package](../manual.md#bandwidth). For this purpose, the RateLimit (policing) mechanism is used. When the data transfer speed in bits per second or packets per second is exceeded, data may be rejected. As a result, uniform traffic may be transmitted at faster speeds than traffic transmitted in sudden bursts.

## Trunk over direct physical interface (client equipment) {#trunk-over-direct-link}

A trunk connection is set up over a direct physical interface between the client equipment at the point of presence and the {{ yandex-cloud }} equipment.

* The client doesn't have their own equipment at the point of presence.
* A trunk connection is set up at the point of presence with the help of a telecom operator, which provides L2 transit.
* The trunk connection is set up between the client equipment in a data center and the {{ yandex-cloud }} equipment.
* When connecting the client equipment, the operator uses their own communication channels. If VLAN-ID numbers of connections (translation of VLAN-ID numbers) at L2 transit need to be changed, the telecom operator discusses the translation scheme with the client for correct configuration of the client equipment in their data center.

## Trunk over direct physical interface (telecom operator's equipment) {#trunk-over-operator-2}

![trunk-over-direct-link](../../_assets/cloud-interconnect/interconnect-trn-3.svg)

* The client doesn't have their own equipment at the point of presence.
* A trunk connection is set up at the point of presence with the help of a telecom operator.
* The trunk connection is set up between the telecom operator's equipment at the point of presence and the {{ yandex-cloud }} equipment.
* Connectivity between the telecom operator's equipment at the point of presence and the client equipment in their data center is ensured at Layer 3 of the interaction. This approach can be useful if the client doesn't wish to handle BGP connectivity with the {{ yandex-cloud }} equipment on their equipment and delegates this task to a telecom operator.
