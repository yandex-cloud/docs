# DNS zones

A DNS zone is a logical space that combines the domain names of your resources and stores the necessary [resource records](resource-record.md). There are two types of DNS zones: [public](#public-zones) and [internal](#private-zones). Regardless of the type, they have a hierarchy: a zone may have one or more subzones.

You can manage the hierarchy of cloud resources and route DNS requests. For example, you can create subzones for the production and test environments and, within them, subzones for applications, DB clusters, caching servers, and more.

The {{ yandex-cloud }} resource model is used to control access to zones, subzones, and resource records.
If a public zone is registered in {{ yandex-cloud }}:

* To create a subzone, you need the rights to manage the parent zone.
* To manage a subzone and its records, no rights to the parent zone are required.

This prevents the creation of subzones for the zones registered in {{ yandex-cloud }} and that users don't have access to.
You can create zones and subzones in different folders. To do this, assign a user or [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) the `editor` role for the folder where the parent zone is located. For more information, see [{#T}](../security/index.md).

For instance, the `example.com.` parent zone is in a folder named `my-folder`. If you have the rights to manage this zone, you can create subzones such as `test.example.com.` and `production.example.com.` in the `my-test-folder` and `my-production-folder` folders, respectively.

## Public zones {#public-zones}

Domain names in public zones are available from the internet. If you have a registered domain, you can delegate it. To do this, specify the addresses of {{ yandex-cloud }} name servers in the `NS` records of your registrar:


* `ns1.{{ dns-ns-host-sld }}.`
* `ns2.{{ dns-ns-host-sld }}.`



You cannot create public top-level domain (TLD) zones.

For security reasons, nested public zones can only be created by users and service accounts with the `dns.editor`, `dns.admin`, `editor`, or `admin` role in the folder where the parent public zone is located. Remember this when organizing the structure of your domain names. For more complex scenarios, contact [support](../../support/overview.md).

The service does not require confirmation of domain ownership. You can use a domain zone even if it's not registered to you. If you delegated your domain to {{ dns-name }} without creating a respective public DNS zone in {{ dns-name }}, this zone can be used by someone else. Therefore, we recommend that you first create a public DNS zone in {{ dns-name }} and then delegate your domain.

{% note info %}

If somebody is using your public DNS zone, contact [support](../../support/overview.md) to confirm your rights to the zone.

{% endnote %}

Requests to public DNS zones and requests for external DNS names from your VMs are public DNS requests. {{ dns-name }} is used for public DNS requests even if your cloud doesn't contain any DNS zones other than service zones.

We recommend [using caching resolvers](../tutorials/local-dns-cache.md), such as `systemd-resolved`, `dnsmasq`, or `unbound`. You can use these to reduce the number of public DNS requests, and thereby, your [costs](../pricing.md#public-dns-requests).

## Internal zones {#private-zones}

Domain names from internal zones can only be used in the [{{ vpc-name }}](../../vpc/) (VPC) networks specified when creating a zone. Within internal zones, you can use the entire namespace in the subnets of the selected network, including `internal.` and `.`.

{% note warning %}

A created internal zone overlaps public zones. If you create an internal zone named `example.com`, all `example.com.` subdomains in this {{ vpc-short-name }} network, which are accessible from the internet, will be inaccessible.

{% endnote %}

### Service zones {#service-zones}

Service zones can be created in {{ vpc-short-name }} networks automatically. A list of these zones depends on the address range of the subnets used. For example:

{% cut "Service zones {{ yandex-cloud }}" %}

* `.`
* `internal.`
* `10.in-addr.arpa.`
* `168.192.in-addr.arpa.`
* `16.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `17.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `18.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `19.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `20.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `21.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `22.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `23.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `24.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `25.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `26.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `27.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `28.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `29.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `30.172.in-addr.arpa.`
* `31.172.in-addr.arpa.`

{% endcut %}

These zones contain records with internal FQDNs of VMs and MDB database names, VM user names, and reverse records. You can't edit records that are created automatically, but you can manage records that are added manually.

To increase fault tolerance, some traffic can be routed to third-party recursive resolvers. To avoid this, contact [support](../../support/overview.md).
