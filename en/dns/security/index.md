# Access management in {{ dns-name }}

In this section, you will learn:
* [Which resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

## What resources you can assign roles to {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

## What roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

The chart below shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. `dns.editor`, for instance, includes all the permissions of `dns.viewer`. You can find the description of each role under the chart.

Active roles in the service:

* Service roles:
   * {% include [dns.auditor](../../_includes/iam/roles/dns-auditor-short.md) %}
   * {% include [dns.viewer](../../_includes/iam/roles/dns-viewer-short.md) %}
   * {% include [dns.editor](../../_includes/iam/roles/dns-editor-short.md) %}
   * {% include [dns.admin](../../_includes/iam/roles/dns-admin-short.md) %}

* Primitive roles:
   * {% include [viewer](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/viewer.md) %}
   * {% include [editor](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/editor.md) %}
   * {% include [admin](../../_includes/iam/roles/short-descriptions/admin.md) %}

## What roles do I need {#required-roles}

The table below lists the roles needed to perform a particular action. You can always assign a role granting more permissions than the role specified. For example, assign `editor` instead of `viewer` or `dns.admin` instead of `dns.editor`.
