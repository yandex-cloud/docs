# Pricing for {{ dns-name }}

{% if product == "cloud-il" %}

At the [Preview](../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage, {{ dns-name }} can be used free of charge.

{% endif %}

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

## Public DNS queries {#public-dns-requests}

{% if region == "ru" %}

{% include [rub-public-dns-requests.md](../_pricing/dns/rub-public-dns-requests.md) %}

{% endif %}

{% if region == "kz" %}

{% include [kzt-public-dns-requests.md](../_pricing/dns/kzt-public-dns-requests.md) %}

{% endif %}

{% if region == "int" %}

{% include [usd-public-dns-requests.md](../_pricing/dns/usd-public-dns-requests.md) %}

{% endif %}

You will be billed for:
* Authoritative queries: Any requests for DNS records in a user's [public zones](concepts/dns-zone.md#public-zones) from the internet or {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* Recursive queries: Queries from a {{ yandex-cloud }} VM for external domain names on the internet.

   {% note tip %}

   We recommend using [caching resolvers](tutorials/local-dns-cache.md), such as `systemd-resolved`,
   `dnsmasq`, or `unbound`. They can help you reduce the number of queries for external domain names, reducing
   costs.

   {% endnote %}

You will not be billed for:
* Queries to [private](concepts/dns-zone.md#private-zones) and [service](concepts/dns-zone.md#service-zones) zones.

**Starting December 6, 2021, the following is provided free of charge**:
* The first one million (1000000) recursive queries from VMs each month.

   Once you have used up this free amount, you will be charged at the published rate.

   The unused balance of free services is reset at the end of the month.
* Queries for domain names of {{ yandex-cloud }} services (such as `{{ api-host }}`) and those offered by Yandex (such as `mail.yandex.com`), both from VMs and the internet.

The cost of public DNS queries is based on usage.

{% if region == "ru" %}

> For example, if the price of 1 million authoritative queries is ₽20 per month, and your public DNS zone
> received 50000 queries in a given month, your cost for the month will be:
> (50000 / 1000000) × ₽20 = 0.05 × ₽20 = ₽1

> For example, if the price of 1 million recursive queries is ₽20 per month, and between December 6 and December 31, 2021, your VMs
> made 1.2 million queries for external DNS names, the cost for the month will be:
> (1.2 − 1.0) × ₽20 = 0.2 × ₽20 = ₽4,
> since the first million recursive queries are free as of December 6, 2021.

{% endif %}

{% if region == "kz" %}

> For example, if the price of 1 million authoritative queries is ₸120 per month, and your public DNS zone received 50000 queries in a given month, your cost for the month will be:
> (50000 / 1000000) × ₸120 = 0.05 × ₸120 = ₸6

> For example, if the price of 1 million recursive queries is ₸120 per month, and between December 6 and December 31, 2021, your VMs made 1.2 million queries for external DNS names, the cost for the month will be:
> (1.2 − 1.0) × ₸120 = 0.2 × ₸120 = ₸24,
> since the first million recursive queries are free as of December 6, 2021.

{% endif %}

{% if region == "int" %}

> For example, if the price of 1 million authoritative queries is $0.256410, and 50000 queries were made during this month,
> the monthly cost will be:
> (50000 / 1000000) × $0.256410 = 0.05 × $0.256410 = $0.0128205

> E. g. if price of 1 million recursive requests is ₽20, and 1.2 million recursive queries were made from your VMs
> between December 6, 2021 and December 31, 2021, the monthly cost will be:
> (1,2 − 1,0) × ₽20 = 0,2 × ₽20 = ₽4
> because first million recursive requests are provided free of charge, starting December 6, 2021.

## DNS zones {#dns-zones}

You are charged for user-created [public](concepts/dns-zone.md#public-zones) or [internal](concepts/dns-zone.md#private-zones) DNS zones.

[Service zones](concepts/dns-zone.md#service-zones) are provided free of charge.

Billing occurs per second. The cost is calculated in proportion to usage.

> For example, the cost of owning 2 DNS zones for 360 hours will be the same as the cost of owning 1 DNS zone
> for 720 hours.
