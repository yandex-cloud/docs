# Registering an account in {{ yandex-cloud }}

To work with {{ yandex-cloud }} services, a billing account is required. A billing account is required even if you plan to use only free services. The account stores information about the payer and payment details, but {{ yandex-cloud }} doesn't debit funds from your bank account and doesn't invoice you until you switch to the [paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md).

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}Under one Yandex account, all payers must be either residents of Russia, residents of Kazakhstan, or residents of other countries. Learn more about [billing accounts](../concepts/billing-account.md).{% endif %}

When creating the first billing account, new customers are given the [initial grant](../concepts/bonus-account.md#start). You can use it to pay for any {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

In addition, a trial period is available to new customers. The [trial period](../concepts/trial-period.md) allows you to discover the possibilities of the cloud infrastructure for free with some limitations. To be able to use the resources in full, after your trial period ends, you need to switch to the paid version.
