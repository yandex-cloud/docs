# Registering an account in {{ yandex-cloud }}

To use {{ yandex-cloud }} services, create a billing account.

A billing account is required even if you plan to use only free services. When creating a billing account, you need to enter payer details, but {{ yandex-cloud }} doesn't debit funds from your bank card and doesn't invoice you until you switch to the [paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md).

Under one Yandex account, all payers must be either residents of the Russian Federation or non-residents. Learn more about [billing accounts](../concepts/billing-account.md).
