Funds are automatically debited from the credit/debit card linked to the billing account at the beginning of the next reporting month if the total debited amount is greater than zero.


 {% note info %}

 {{ yandex-cloud }} reserves the right to automatically debit funds during the current reporting period if your account balance exceeds the established [billing threshold](../concepts/billing-threshold.md).

 {% endnote %}


The payment is usually transferred within 15 to 20 minutes. You can view your payment history [here](../operations/check-bill-history.md).

If you do not have enough funds on your credit/debit card on the day when funds are to be debited, the debit transaction will be repeated later. If the funds cannot be debited within one day, {{ yandex-cloud }} reserves the right to change the status of your billing account to [Suspended](../concepts/billing-account.md#conditions).
