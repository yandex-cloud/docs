Funds are automatically debited from the bank card linked to the billing account at the beginning of the next reporting month if the total debited amount is greater than zero.

{% note info %}

Yandex.Cloud reserves the right to automatically debit funds during the current reporting period if your account balance exceeds the [credit limit](../concepts/credit-limit.md) set.

{% endnote %}

The payment is usually transferred within 15 to 20 minutes. Here you can [view your payment history](../operations/check-bill-history.md).

If your bank card balance is insufficient on the day when funds are to be debited, the debit transaction will be repeated later. If the funds cannot be debited within one day, Yandex.Cloud reserves the right to change the status of your billing account to [Suspended](../concepts/billing-account.md#conditions).
