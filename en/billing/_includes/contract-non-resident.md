To enter into an agreement, you must submit a request using the **Contact sales** form on the [Contact us](https://cloud.yandex.com/support) page. If a positive decision is made based on your request, Yandex.Cloud will prepare an agreement and send you an electronic version to sign. As soon as you receive the copy:

1. Review the terms of the agreement.
1. Check that your payment details are correct.
1. Print a copy of the agreement and put your signature on all pages that have a field for it (usually after specifying the details of the parties).
1. Send us a scanned copy of the signed agreement in a reply message.
