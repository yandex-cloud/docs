#### I created a new billing account, but it's blocked. Why? {#blocked-account}

Most likely, you previously created a billing account that used the initial grant. The initial grant can only be issued to one billing account within the trial period.

To unblock your new billing account, [activate the paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md).
