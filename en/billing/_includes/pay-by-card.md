Funds are automatically debited from the bank card linked to the billing account at the beginning of the next reporting month if the total debited amount is greater than zero.

{% note info %}

{{ yandex-cloud }} reserves the right to automatically debit funds during the current reporting period if your account balance exceeds the established [billing threshold](../concepts/billing-threshold.md).

The payment is usually transferred within 15 to 20 minutes. In accordance with Russian Federal Law No. [FZ-54 "On the use of cash registers"](http://base.garant.ru/12130951/), you will be sent a [payment receipt](../concepts/individual-bill.md) by email. We recommend that you keep payment receipts, but even if you delete them, you can [view your payment history](../operations/check-bill-history.md).

{% endif %}

If your bank card balance is insufficient on the day when funds are to be debited, the debit transaction will be repeated later.
