Funds are automatically debited from the bank card linked to the billing account at the beginning of the next reporting month if the total debited amount is greater than zero.


{% note info %}

{{ yandex-cloud }} reserves the right to automatically debit funds during the current reporting period if your account balance exceeds the established [billing threshold](../concepts/billing-threshold.md).

{% endnote %}




If your bank card balance is insufficient on the day when funds are to be debited, the debit transaction will be repeated later.
