You can link a [billing account](../concepts/billing-account.md) to one or more clouds. Both new and existing clouds can be linked.

Each cloud in {{ yandex-cloud }} must be linked to only one billing account. If you link an existing cloud, you are effectively transferring it between billing accounts.
