#### How do I change my payment method? {#payment-method}

You can only [change](../operations/change-payment-method.md) your payment method if your billing account type is **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.create-new.account-type_label_company }}**; in this case, along with bank card transfer, you can use [bank account transfer](../payment/payment-methods-business.md).


If your account is an **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.create-new.account-type_label_individual }}**, you cannot change your payment method.
