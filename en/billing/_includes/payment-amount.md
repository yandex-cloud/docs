The total amount debited depends on whether you used up your [grant](../concepts/bonus-account.md) and topped up your [personal account](../concepts/personal-account.md#balance) during the reporting period.

- Example 1
  
  <br/>The personal account balance at the beginning of the reporting period is 0 dollars.
  <br/>During the reporting period, the account was topped up by 0 dollars.
  <br/>The grant amount is 10 dollars.
  <br/>The billing threshold is 20 dollars.
  <br/>In the middle of the reporting period, the billing threshold is reached and the amount of consumed resources is 30 dollars.
  <br/>Total amount: 30 - (0 + 0 + 10) = 20 dollars.
  <br/>In the middle of the reporting period, 20 dollars may be debited from the linked bank card.
  
- Example 2
  
  <br/>The personal account balance at the beginning of the reporting period is 0 dollars.
  <br/>During the reporting period, the account was topped up by 0 dollars.
  <br/>The grant amount is 10 dollars.
  <br/>At the end of the reporting period, the amount for consumed resources is 8 dollars.
  <br/>The grant amount at the end of the reporting period is 2 dollars. The personal account balance has not changed.
  <br/>At the beginning of the next reporting month, no funds are debited from the linked bank card.
  
- Example 3
  
  <br/>The personal account balance at the beginning of the reporting period is 0 dollars.
  <br/>During the reporting period, the account was topped up by 0 dollars.
  <br/>The grant amount is 10 dollars.
  <br/>The billing threshold is 20 dollars.
  <br/>At the end of the reporting period, the amount of consumed resources is 23 dollars. The billing threshold has not been reached and the grant has been fully spent.
  <br/>Total amount: 23 - (0 + 0 + 10) = 13 dollars.
  <br/>At the beginning of the next reporting period, 13 dollars will be debited from the linked bank card.
