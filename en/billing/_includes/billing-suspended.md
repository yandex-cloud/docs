{% note warning %}

You can be charged for using some services even if the billing account status is `SUSPENDED`. These can be such resources as snapshots and disks of stopped instances and unused public IP addresses. To check the charged amounts, open [**{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.switch_detail }}** in Billing](../operations/check-charges.md) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.label_consumption }}** detail mode.
