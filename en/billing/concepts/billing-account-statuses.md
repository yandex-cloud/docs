# Billing account statuses

The status of your billing account depends on whether you have any arrears resulting from a failure to pay for resource usage.

## List of statuses {#list}

A billing account can have one of the following statuses:
- `NEW`: Billing account is being created.
- `PENDING`: Account confirmation required.
- `PAYMENT_NOT_CONFIRMED`: Account confirmation required. An email with further instructions has been sent to the email address specified in your Yandex or YandexÂ 360 account.
- `TRIAL_ACTIVE`: Trial period has been activated and there is at least one unspent grant.
- `TRIAL_SUSPENDED`: Trial period has not been activated, as the initial grant was previously provided for another billing account of yours.
- `TRIAL_SUSPENDED`: Trial period has ended or all available grants have been spent.
   `FIRST_PAYMENT_REQUIRED`: You need to confirm account creation by making a deposit.
- `ACTIVE`: Paid version has been activated and there is no outstanding debt for resource usage.
- `PAYMENT_REQUIRED`: There is outstanding debt for service usage.
- `SUSPENDED`: Access to resources has been suspended.

If your account has been suspended for a long time or the cloud status is `PENDING_DELETION`, make sure to manually [cancel](../../resource-manager/operations/cloud/delete-cancel.md) its deletion.

| `PAYMENT_REQUIRED` | Negative | Account has debts for service usage. <br/><br/>Use of {{ yandex-cloud }} services may be suspended if you don't pay the amount owed in time. During the suspension period, a fee is charged for data storage services, in addition to a late payment fee. |
