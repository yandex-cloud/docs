# Promo codes

A **promo code** is a password that allows you to get an additional discount on {{ yandex-cloud }} services.

## Get and activate a promo code {#activate-promocode}

A promo code can be provided to you as part of a Yandex promotional offer.

You can activate your promo code only once. For more information, see [Activate a promo code](../operations/activate-promocode.md).

## Terms of use and validity period {#terms-of-use}

One promo code can only be linked to one billing account.

The terms of use and the validity period are specified in the message containing the promo code. Activate your promo code before the deadline specified in the message; otherwise, the promo code becomes invalid. You cannot replace or extend the promo code.


{% note info %}

All previously issued and unused promo codes that were provided to access the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console are no longer valid starting November 27, 2018.
