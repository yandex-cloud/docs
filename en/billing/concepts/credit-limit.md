# Credit limit

The credit limit is the maximum negative [personal account balance](../concepts/personal-account.md#balance).

## Credit limit amount {#amount}

The credit limit amount is calculated individually and depends on a combination of factors, including:

- [Billing account type](../concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types).
- Amount for resources consumed.
- Your financial standing.

You can find information about the credit limit amount in the [management console](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/billing).

## Activating the credit limit {#enable}

The credit limit is activated automatically after you [switch to the paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md) and the first reporting period ends.

## Using the credit limit {#using}

The credit limit can only be used if you don't have a [grant](../concepts/bonus-account.md) and your [personal account balance](../concepts/personal-account.md#balance) is zero. If you are using the credit limit, charges are accumulated.

## Paying outstanding charges {#using}

The outstanding charges shall be paid within the deadline stipulated in the [agreement](../concepts/contract.md). [The payment method](../payment/payment-methods.md) depends on your legal status.

> [!NOTE]
>
>We recommend that you independently monitor the spending of funds on your personal account and [top up the balance so that it is always positive](../operations/pay-the-bill.md). If your personal account balance exceeds the maximum amount of the credit limit and you fail to pay the outstanding charges before the deadline stipulated in the agreement, Yandex.Cloud reserves the right to change the status of your personal account to [PAYMENT_REQUIRED](../concepts/billing-account-statuses.md).
