## Additional grants {#additional}
Additional grants can be provided upon a {{ yandex-cloud }} manager's decision, as well as under the content-program, referral-program, or [Yandex Cloud Boost program](../../../cloud-boost). You can view the amount of additional grants and their validity period in {{ billing-name }}.




## Using grants {#how-to-use}
Grants are prioritized based on their validity period: the earlier the expiration date, the sooner the grant is used.
