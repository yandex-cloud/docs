## Additional grants {#additional}
Additional grants can be provided upon a {{ yandex-cloud }} manager's decision, as well as under the [content program](../../../content-program), [referral program](../../../referral-program), or [Yandex Cloud Boost program](../../../cloud-boost). You can view the amount of additional grants and their validity period in {{ billing-name }}.




## Using grants {#how-to-use}
The grant priority depends on its validity period: the earlier it expires, the earlier the grant is used. For more information about using grants, see the [billing cycle description](../payment/billing-cycle-individual).
