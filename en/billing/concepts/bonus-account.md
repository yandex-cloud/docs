# Grant

Grant is a discount for using any {{ yandex-cloud }} services provided to a sole proprietor, a business, or an individual. The discount amount is equal to the grant amount. It is applied to the total cost of the consumed services.

## Initial grant {#start}
When [creating your first billing account](../quickstart/index.md), you are provided with an initial grant. For more information about the size of the initial grant and conditions for its use, see the document [Getting started](../../getting-started/usage-grant.md).

{% note info %}

Each individual, sole proprietor, or business can be given only one initial grant.

{% endnote %}

## Additional grants {#additional}
Additional grants can be provided upon a {{ yandex-cloud }} manager's decision, as well as under the [content program](../../../content-program), [referral program](../../../referral-program), or [Yandex Cloud Boost program](../../../cloud-boost). You can view the amount of additional grants and their validity period in the management console.




## Using grants {#how-to-use}
The grant priority depends on its validity period: the earlier it expires, the earlier the grant is used. For more information about using grants, see the [billing cycle description](../payment/billing-cycle-individual).
