# Billing accounts

Billing accounts are used to identify the user paying for resources in Yandex.Cloud.

The billing account can be linked to multiple clouds and one [personal account](personal-account.md). You can only use the payment method that corresponds to the type of billing account and your [agreement](contract.md).

The relationship between clouds, billing accounts, personal accounts, and payment methods is shown in the diagram below.
