# Billing accounts


Billing accounts are used to identify users paying for resources in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

A billing account can be linked to multiple clouds and one [personal account](personal-account.md). You can only use the payment method that corresponds to the type of billing account and your [agreement](contract.md).

The relationship between clouds, billing accounts, personal accounts, and payment methods is shown in the diagram below.

You can [delete a billing account](../operations/delete-account.md) if you no longer plan to use {{ yandex-cloud }} services.
