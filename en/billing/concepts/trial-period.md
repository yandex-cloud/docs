# Trial period

{% include [free-trial-conditions](../../_includes/free-trial-conditions.md) %}

The trial period allows you to use {{ yandex-cloud }} resources for free with some limitations. Consumed resources are paid for from the [initial grant](bonus-account.md#start). After the end of the trial period, the resources are kept but discontinued. To resume working with {{ yandex-cloud }}, you need to fully upgrade to the paid version.

The balance of the initial grant and the number of days until the end of the trial period are displayed in the billing account on [Billing]({{ link-console-billing }}). During the trial period, you can also [view statistics](../operations/check-charges.md) on resource usage and charges based on the usage rate.

{% note warning %}

The trial period is enabled only at the time of [creating the first billing account](../quickstart/index.md) in the management console {{ yandex-cloud }}.
