# Trial period for new customers


{% include [free-trial-conditions](../../_includes/free-trial-conditions.md) %}

The trial period allows you to use {{ yandex-cloud }} resources for free with some limitations. You pay for the resources you consume from the [initial grant](bonus-account.md#start). After the end of the trial period, the resources will be retained but discontinued. To resume working with {{ yandex-cloud }}, you will need to fully upgrade to the paid version.

The balance of the initial grant and the number of days until the end of the trial period are displayed in the billing account on the [**{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.navigation-menu.label_billing }}**]({{ link-console-billing }}) page. During the trial period, you can also [view statistics](../operations/check-charges.md) on resource usage and charges based on the usage rate.

{% note warning %}

You can enable the trial period only when [creating your first billing account](../quickstart/index.md) for a legal entity in {{ billing-name }}.
