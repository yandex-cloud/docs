# Agreement

In {{ yandex-cloud }}, all services are rendered under an agreement that you accept when you create a [billing account](billing-account.md). The agreement does not need to be signed by both parties.

## For residents of Russia{#residents}

Once the offer has been accepted, both parties start acting under the agreement in accordance with the Civil Code of the Russian Federation. The agreement stipulates that you shall pay for the resources consumed at the end of the reporting period. For more information, see [How to pay for resources](../payment/index.md).
