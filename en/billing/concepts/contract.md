# Agreement

In Yandex.Cloud, all services are provided under an agreement. Its execution depends on the country where you live and your legal status.

## For residents of Russia{#residents}

Services for residents of Russia are rendered under an agreement that you accept when you create a [billing account](billing-account.md). The agreement does not need to be signed by both parties.

Once the offer has been accepted, both parties start acting under the agreement in accordance with the Civil Code of the Russian Federation. The agreement stipulates that you shall pay for the resources consumed at the end of the reporting period. For more information, see [How to pay for resources](../payment/index.md).

The agreement number is displayed in the management console on the **Account data** page. You can learn more about the terms of the agreement in [Yandex.Legal documents](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_oferta/?lang=ru).
