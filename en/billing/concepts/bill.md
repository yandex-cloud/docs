# Payment invoice

A payment invoice is a document issued for you to pay for the resources consumed. A payment invoice is issued within your [billing account](billing-account.md) and contains aggregate data on all the services used within a single cloud.

The relationship between the payment invoice, billing account, and cloud is shown in the diagram below.

## Issuing a payment invoice {#agregate}

A payment invoice is issued at the beginning of the next reporting period if the following conditions are met:

- The selected payment method is [Transfer from your bank account](../payment/payment-methods-business.md).
- The [credit limit](../concepts/credit-limit.md) is used.
- [The total invoice amount](#payment-amount) is greater than zero.

{% note info %}

Yandex.Cloud reserves the right to issue a payment invoice during the current reporting period if you exceed the established credit limit.

- Example 1

  <br/>The personal account balance at the beginning of the reporting period is 0 rubles.
<br/>The balance has not been topped up during the entire reporting period (0 rubles).
<br/>The grant amount is 1000 rubles.
<br/>The credit limit is 1000 rubles.
<br/>At the end of the reporting period, the credit limit has not been reached and the amount for resources consumed is 1400 rubles.
<br/>Total amount: 1400 - (0 + 0 + 1000) = 400 (rubles).
<br/>At the beginning of the next reporting period, you will be issued a payment invoice for the amount you have actually used (in this case, 400 rubles).

- Example 2

  <br/>The personal account balance at the beginning of the reporting period is 0 rubles.
<br/>The balance has not been topped up during the entire reporting period (0 rubles).

<br/>By the end of the reporting period, the amount for resources consumed is 800 rubles.
<br/>The grant amount at the end of the reporting period is 200 rubles. The personal account balance has not changed.
<br/>At the beginning of the next reporting month, no payment invoice will be generated.

- Example 3

  <br/>The personal account balance at the beginning of the reporting period is 0 rubles.
<br/>The balance has not been topped up during the entire reporting period (0 rubles).
<br/>The grant amount is 1000 rubles.
<br/>The credit limit is 1000 rubles.
<br/>In the middle of the reporting period, the established credit limit has been reached and the amount for resources consumed is 2000 rubles.
<br/>Total amount: 2000 - (0 + 0 + 1000) = 1000 (rubles).
