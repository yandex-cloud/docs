# Payment invoice

A payment invoice is a document issued for you to pay for the resources consumed. A payment invoice is issued within your [billing account](billing-account.md) and contains aggregate data on all the services used within a single cloud.

The relationship between the payment invoice, billing account, and cloud is shown in the diagram below.
