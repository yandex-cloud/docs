# Payment invoice

A payment invoice is a document issued for you to pay for the resources consumed. A payment invoice is issued within your [billing account](billing-account.md) and contains aggregate data on all the services used within a single cloud.

The relationship between the payment invoice, billing account, and cloud is shown in the diagram below.

## Issuing an invoice {#agregate}

A payment invoice is generated automatically and issued at the beginning of the following reporting period under the conditions below:

* The selected payment method is [Transfer from your bank account](../payment/payment-methods-business.md).
* [The total invoice amount](#payment-amount) is greater than zero.

An invoice is only sent to the [billing account](billing-account.md) owner's email address. You cannot change the email address but you can configure message forwarding. For more information, see [Yandex Mail Help](https://yandex.com/support/mail/web/preferences/filters/forwarding.html).

{% note info %}

{{ yandex-cloud }} reserves the right to issue a payment invoice during the current reporting period if you exceed your established billing threshold.
