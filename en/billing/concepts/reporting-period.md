# Reporting period

The reporting period is equal to one calendar month during which you are using {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

At the beginning of each month, you are required to pay for the resources consumed in the previous period. If there is a debt on your account, the use of {{ yandex-cloud }} resources may be suspended. The [payment method](../payment/index.md) depends on your legal status ([billing account type](billing-account.md#ba-types)).

On the last day of the month, [Yandex Balance](https://balance.yandex.com/) will generate [reporting documents](../payment/documents.md) for businesses and individual entrepreneurs.
