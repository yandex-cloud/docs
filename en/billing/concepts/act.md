# Reports

{{ yandex-cloud }} users can request [completion reports](##report-of-completion) and a [reconciliation report](#reconciliation-report). Reconciliation reports are available only for residents of the Russian Federation.

## Completion report {#report-of-completion}

A completion report is a primary accounting document confirming the provision of services. It contains aggregate data on the cost of the services actually provided. Detailed information about the services rendered is available on the [Usage details](../operations/check-charges.md) page.

For residents of Russia, Yandex.Cloud LLC generates unilateral reports. The civil legislation, just like the Tax Code and the accounting legislation, do not require any acceptance reports under fee-based service agreements. The acceptance of works can be formally acknowledged by a report or other documentary evidence (as per Articles 783 and 720 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation). Moreover, there are no legal regulations that require making a bilateral report or executing another bilateral document when submitting and accepting works or services.
Yandex.Cloud LLC issues unilateral reports according to the [offer agreement](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_oferta/) it signs with the customer. The reports contain all the details required under civil and accounting legislation in line with the requirements for primary accounting documents.

### Creating a completion report {#create-act}

Reports are generated at the end of the reporting period for the amount actually spent from the [personal account](../concepts/personal-account.md) balance.

Reports are then used as a basis for generating [invoices](../concepts/invoice.md).
