# Report

A report is a primary accounting document that confirms services rendered. It contains aggregate data on the cost of the services actually rendered. Detailed information about the services rendered is available on the [Usage details](../operations/check-charges.md) page.

## Generating reports {#create-act}

Reports are generated at the end of the reporting period for the amount actually used from the [personal account](../concepts/personal-account.md).

Reports are then used as a basis for generating [invoices](../concepts/invoice.md).
