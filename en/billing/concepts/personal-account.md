# Personal account

A personal account is your unique ID in the {{ billing-name }} service used to pay for resources during the entire term of your [agreement](contract.md). It holds the funds that you credit to it using a bank card or bank transfer (the crediting method depends on your legal status).

The funds are debited from your personal account only if you have no [grants](bonus-account.md).

## Creating a personal account {#create-ls}

Your personal account is created automatically once you [activate the paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md). The account is virtual and does not have the status of a settlement or bank account. It cannot be disabled.

## Personal account number  {#id}

You can find your personal account number in [Payment invoice](bill.md).

## Personal account balance  {#balance}

After the paid version is activated, the personal account balance is zero by default.

{% include [personal-account-balance](../_includes/personal-account-balance.md) %}

We recommend that you [monitor](../operations/pay-the-bill.md) and top up your personal account balance so that it is always positive.

If you fail to top up your personal account on time, the use of the {{ yandex-cloud }} services may be suspended. Prior to suspension, a payment notice will be sent to the email address specified in your billing account. You will receive payment notices seven and three days prior to suspension, as well as on the day of suspension. After you top up your personal account, access to resource consumption will be restored within 24 hours.

## Methods and terms of crediting funds to your personal account {#methods}

The method of crediting funds to your personal account depends on your legal status ([billing account type](../concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types)). How fast the funds will be credited to your personal account depends on the payment method. For more information, see [Payment methods](../payment/index.md).

{% note info %}

You cannot use [grants](bonus-account.md) to top up your personal account.
