# VAT accounting

Amounts of any and all payment invoices, reports, and invoices issued to legal entities and any and all payment receipts issued to individuals include VAT (20%).

If you pay for resources with a bank card in a foreign currency, the equivalent amount in rubles, with VAT, is debited from the bank card. Since you make a payment in rubles, no VAT of the country you live in is applied.
