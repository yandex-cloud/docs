# Billing and payment currency

The currency depends on the agreement and the country of residence:


{% list tabs %}

- For residents of Russia

   Residents of Russia may top up their personal accounts and pay for consumed resources in rubles (₽), regardless of their legal status ([billing account type](../concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types)).

- For residents of Kazakhstan

   Residents of Kazakhstan may top up their personal accounts and pay for consumed resources in tenge (₸), regardless of their legal status ([billing account type](../concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types)).

- For non-residents of Russia and Kazakhstan

   Non-residents of Russia and Kazakhstan must top up their personal accounts and pay for consumed resources in US dollars ($) only.


{% endlist %}



{% note info %}

If you top up your personal account using a bank card in a currency that is different from that specified in the agreement, the equivalent amount in the agreement currency will be held on the bank card at the time of top-up. However, the final amount debited may differ due to currency exchange rates or conversion conditions.
Please check the details of debiting funds with your bank.
