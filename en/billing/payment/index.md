# Paying for resources

Resources are paid for by crediting funds to an individual personal account as per the contract. In {{ yandex-cloud }}, you pay for resources depending on the amount consumed. The currency depends on the [agreement and the payer's country of residence](currency.md). The method for crediting funds and the billing cycle depend on your legal status (billing account type).
