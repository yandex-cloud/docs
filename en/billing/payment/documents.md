# Financial documents

The Billing service sends out financial documents regarding any and all payments made on behalf of individuals or businesses.

## Documents for businesses {#docs-for-business}

If you used funds from your [personal account](../concepts/personal-account.md) during  the billing period, [Yandex.Balance](https://balance.yandex.com/) will generate the following reporting documents on the last day of the month:

- [Report](../concepts/act.md)
- [Invoice](../concepts/invoice.md)

Copies of documents will be sent to the email address of the billing account owner at the beginning of the next billing period.
<br/>Soft and hard copies of a document are identical. To prepare your financial reports on time, you can use the number, amount, and date of the report from the email received.
<br/>Paper source documents with all signatures and stamps are provided only upon [request](../qa/common.md) to Yandex.Cloud technical support. The request must specify the agreement number (specified in the statement) and the period you need the documents for.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Documents are sent to the email address and mailing address specified in the billing account. Make sure the addresses are specified correctly.

## Documents for individuals {#docs-for-individual}

Individuals shall be provided with a [payment receipt](../concepts/individual-bill.md) in accordance with Russian Federal Law No. [FZ-54 <q>"On the use of cash registers"</q>](http://base.garant.ru/12130951/). It is sent to the email address of the billing account owner. The original receipt is not sent.
<br/>You can also get a report of the services actually rendered. To do that, [send a request](../qa/common.md) to the support service for Yandex.Cloud through the management console.
