# Reporting documents

The Billing service sends out financial documents regarding any and all payments made on behalf of individual entrepreneurs, individuals, and businesses.

If you used funds from your [personal account](../concepts/personal-account.md) during the reporting period, [Yandex.Balance](https://balance.yandex.com/) will generate the following reporting documents on the last day of the month:

- [Report](../concepts/act.md)
