# Reporting documents for businesses and individual entrepreneurs

If you used funds from your [personal account](../concepts/personal-account.md) during the reporting period, [Yandex Balance](https://balance.yandex.com/) will generate the following reporting documents on the last day of the month:
* [Report](../concepts/act.md)
* [Invoice](../concepts/invoice.md) (for residents of Russia or the Republic of Kazakhstan only, invoices for residents of the Republic of Kazakhstan are generated electronically.)

Copies of documents are sent to the email address specified in the payer's card in [Yandex Balance](https://balance.yandex.com) at the beginning of the following reporting period.

Soft and hard copies of a document are identical. To prepare your financial reports on time, you can use the number, amount, and date of the report from the email received.

Paper originals of documents with all signatures and seals are sent by Russian Post to the physical address specified during registration at the start of the following reporting period.
