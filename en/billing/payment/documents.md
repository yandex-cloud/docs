# Reporting documents for businesses and individual entrepreneurs

If, during the reporting period, you used funds from your [personal account](../concepts/personal-account.md) services, [Yandex Balance](https://balance.yandex.com/) will generate for you the following reporting documents on the last day of the month:
* [Report](../concepts/act.md)
* [Invoice](../concepts/invoice.md) (for residents of Russia or the Republic of Kazakhstan only, invoices for residents of the Republic of Kazakhstan are generated electronically.)


Copies of documents are sent to the email address specified in the payer's card in [Yandex Balance](https://balance.yandex.com) at the beginning of the following reporting period.

Soft and hard copies of a document are identical. To prepare your financial reports on time, you can use the number, amount, and date of the report from the email received.


The original documents in paper form with all signatures and seals are sent by Russian Post to the physical address specified at registration, at the start of the following reporting period.
