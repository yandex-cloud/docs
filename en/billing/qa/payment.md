# Questions about payment

#### Who can pay for resources? {#how-to-buy}

Resources are paid for by crediting funds to an individual [personal account](../concepts/personal-account.md) as per the [agreement](../concepts/contract.md). Funds can be credited to a personal account by individuals and businesses.

For more information, see [How to pay for resources](../payment/index.md).

{% endlist %}

#### Can I pay for resources with a bank card in a different currency?  {#currency-2}

Yes.

If you pay for resources with a bank card in a foreign currency, the equivalent amount in rubles, including VAT, is debited from the bank card. Additional bank fees for the currency conversion might be debited or credited a day or two later.

#### I linked a bank card to my billing account. When will money be debited from it? {#unlink-card}

If this is your trial period, funds will not be debited from the bank card you linked.
Since you do not automatically upgrade to the paid version at the end of the trial period, funds are only debited after activating the paid version and using Yandex.Cloud services.

If you upgraded to the paid version and used Yandex.Cloud services, do the following to stop incurring charges:

1. Settle your arrears (if any).
1. Delete all billable service resources.
1. Contact [technical support](https://cloud.yandex.com/support) to deactivate your account.

#### I linked a cloud to a new billing account. How do I pay for services now? {#unlink-cloud}

If the [cloud was previously linked](../operations/pin-cloud.md) to another billing account, check the period of the services: for services provided before the move, pay from the previous billing account. For services provided after, pay from the current billing account. The payment method must match [the billing account type](../concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types).

#### Will you provide an agreement for the provision and payment of services? {#oferta}

{% include [contract-qa](../_includes/contract-qa.md) %}

#### Where can I read the terms of the agreement? {#oferta-terms}

{% list tabs %}

- For residents of Russia

   You can learn more about the terms of the agreement in the section [Yandex.Legal documents](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_oferta/?lang=en).

- For non-residents of the Russian Federation

{% endlist %}

#### Can a signed agreement be finalized? {#contract}

Businesses may conclude an agreement that is signed by both parties. To do this, you must submit a request using the **Ask a question** form on the [Contact us](https://cloud.yandex.com/support) page. A Yandex.Cloud manager will contact you to discuss terms and conditions of signing the agreement.

#### How is resource consumption charged?  {#tariffs}

Yandex.Cloud resources are consumed on an as-needed basis. The amount for resources consumed is calculated individually for each service.
