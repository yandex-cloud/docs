#### How do I reference a signed agreement? {#refer-to-contract}

An agreement is provided as an [offer](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_oferta/). Specify the agreement number and add a link to the offer or its printed version. Under article 435 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, this fully conforms to the legal status of a signed service agreement.
