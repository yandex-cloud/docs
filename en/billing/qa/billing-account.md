#### I created a new billing account, but it's blocked. Why? {#blocked-account}

It's most likely that you previously created a billing account that activated the trial period. Your billing account received the initial grant during the trial period. Since the initial grant can only be given to one billing account, you cannot use the trial period during re-registration. As a result, your new billing account is created with the `SUSPENDED` status.
To unblock your new billing account, [activate the paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md) and [top up your personal account](../operations/pay-the-bill.md) for the minimum amount (the minimum amount is shown in the **Top up account** window).

#### How do I change my billing account type? {#account-type}

You can't change a billing account type once it's created, but you can [create a new one](../operations/create-new-account.md).

#### How do I enable the credit limit?  {#credit}

[The credit limit](../concepts/credit-limit.md) is enabled automatically after the [paid version is activated](../operations/activate-commercial.md) and the first reporting period ends.

#### How can I change my payment details or the delivery address?  {#change-email}

#### I didn't receive an email with instructions on what to do after creating a billing account with the Bank transfer payment method. Why?  {#account-notification}

It may take up to three business days to activate your billing account.
If you didn't receive an email within that period, send a request to: [cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru](mailto:cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru).

#### I unlinked a bank card from my Yandex.Passport account and now my billing account is blocked. What should I do?  {#account-card}

Your billing account status changed to `SUSPENDED` in accordance with the [terms and conditions of the agreement (clause 6.11.4.)](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_oferta/).
After suspension, an email with instructions on how to restore access was sent to the email address specified in your Yandex or Yandex.Connect account.

#### I can't link a bank card when creating a billing account. What should I do?  {#cant-create}

The service most likely doesn't support the payment system of your bank card.

To resolve the issue, try linking a different bank card or, if you are a business owner, create a billing account with the **Business account** type and **Bank transfer** payment method.

#### Why do I get the error "The country is not available to the payer" when creating a billing account?  {#account-error}

You most likely logged in under a Yandex account that is already linked to a payer with a different residence status.

{% include [billing-account-payers](../_includes/billing-account-payers.md) %}

To create a billing account with a payer who is a resident of another country, log in under a different Yandex.Passport or Yandex.Connect account.
