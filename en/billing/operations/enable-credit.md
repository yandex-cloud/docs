# Enable a billing threshold

After [activating the paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md) and the first reporting period ends, you may be given a [billing threshold](../concepts/billing-threshold.md) for using {{ yandex-cloud }} services:

- Billing thresholds for individuals are enabled automatically.
- Businesses have to submit an activation request.

To submit a request:

1. In [management console]({{ link-console-billing }}), click ![image](../../_assets/ugly-sandwich.svg) and go to **Billing**.
1. Select an account on the **List of accounts** page.
1. Click **Switch to post-payment** on the **Overview** page. The request form opens.
1. Fill in all the request fields and attach the following documents:
     - A copy of the certificate of incorporation or business registration.
     - A copy of the resolution or minutes regarding the appointment of the general director (if you are the general director).
     - A copy of the power of attorney of the business representative (if you are a representative).
1. Click **Send request**.

Your request is reviewed within three business days. As soon as the decision is made, a {{ yandex-cloud }} manager will contact you. If the decision is positive, all information about the billing threshold is available in [management console]({{ link-console-billing }}).
