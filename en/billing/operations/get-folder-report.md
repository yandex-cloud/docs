# Get expense details by folder

You can get a CSV file with your general or per-resource spending details.

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

1. If you do not have any [folders](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) yet, [create a folder](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/create.md). In the folder name, specify the name of the project or client that is going to use this folder.
1. [Create a bucket](../../storage/operations/buckets/create.md) in {{ objstorage-full-name }}. {{ yandex-cloud }} will save detail files to this bucket. You can save details in multiple buckets.

   {% note alert %}

   Don't make your bucket public, otherwise anyone can download your expense details from the bucket link.

   {% endnote %}

1. Make sure you have one of the following roles: `billing.accounts.owner`, `billing.accounts.admin`, `billing.accounts.editor`.

   1. Select ![image](../../_assets/billing.svg) [**Billing**]({{ link-console-billing }}).

   1. Click **Create**.
   1. In the **Create periodic export** window that opens, enter:
      * In the **Bucket** field, the name of the bucket to store the CSV file with details.
      * In the **Directory** field, the name of the directory for the file. The last character must be `/`.
      * Select the language for product names: English or Russian. 
      * Select the type of details: **General** or **Resource**.
   1. Click **Create**.

{% endlist %}

A new file with details is created in the bucket daily. The file name contains the prefix and date that details are collected for. The file is overwritten and updated with new data every hour.

The information can be updated in any daily file within a month.

{% note tip %}

Files with details from buckets aren't deleted automatically, but you can set up a deletion schedule. For more information, see [Object lifecycle](../../storage/concepts/lifecycles.md) ({{ objstorage-name }} refers to files in a bucket as _objects_).
