# Viewing a cost breakdown report

A cost breakdown helps you understand exactly where your money is going, streamline expenses, and plan your budget more precisely.

There are several ways to get a cost breakdown:

* [In the management console](./check-charges.md)
* [In {{ datalens-full-name }}](./dashboard.md)
* [One-time export](./get-folder-report.md#single-time-download)
* [Scheduled export](./get-folder-report.md#set-up-regular-download)
* [Via API](./get-charges-via-api.md)

You can also [search your cost breakdowns for specific data](./query-integration.md) using queries in {{ yq-full-name }}.
