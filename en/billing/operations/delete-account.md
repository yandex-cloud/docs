# Delete a billing account

To delete a {{ yandex-cloud }} billing account you no longer need:

1. [Delete all resource folders](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/delete.md) from all clouds linked to the billing account.
1. [Pay any outstanding charges](../concepts/billing-threshold.md#arrears).
1. [Contact support]({{ link-console-support }}) and provide them the billing account ID (you can find it on the [**{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.navigation-menu.label_billing }}**]({{ link-console-billing }}) tab).

Please note that this operation cannot be undone.
