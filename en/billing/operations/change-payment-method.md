# Change the payment method

The payment method can only be changed for the billing account of the **Business account** type:  you can only use a transfer from your bank account instead of a transfer from your bank card. To do this, send a request to: [cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru](mailto:cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru).

{% include [change-payment-docs](../_includes/change-payment-docs.md) %}

Your request will be reviewed within three business days. As soon as a decision is made, a {{ yandex-cloud }} manager will contact you.

{% note info %}

Once your card is unlinked from your billing account, you will not be able to add a new card. You will only be able to [top up your billing account](../operations/pay-the-bill.md) by [wiring money in from your bank account (via your bank)](../payment/payment-methods-business.md).
