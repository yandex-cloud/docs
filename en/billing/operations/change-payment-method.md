# Change payment method

The payment method can only be changed for the billing account of the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.create-new.account-type_label_company }}**. You can only use wire transfer instead of bank card payment. To change payment method, send a request to [cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru](mailto:cloud_docs@support.yandex.ru).



{% include [change-payment-docs](../_includes/change-payment-docs.md) %}


Your request will be reviewed within three business days. As soon as a decision is made, a {{ yandex-cloud }} manager will contact you.

{% note info %}

Once your card is unlinked from your billing account, you will not be able to add a new card. [To top up your billing account](../operations/pay-the-bill.md), you will only be able to use [wire transfer](../payment/payment-methods-business.md).
