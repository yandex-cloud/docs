# Enabling electronic document management

Once you enable electronic document management (EDM), {{ yandex-cloud }} stops sending:

* Electronic versions of closing documents to your email address.
* Originals of closing documents by Russian Post to your physical address.

Learn more about [what documents can be received using electronic document management](../concepts/edo.md#document).

{{ yandex-cloud }} only uses EDM with businesses and individual entrepreneurs that are residents of Russia.

## Enable EDM {#connect}

To start working with {{ yandex-cloud }} via EDM:

1. Connect to an EDM [operator](../concepts/edo.md#operator): [Diadoc (SKB Kontur)](https://kontur-inc.com/diadoc) or [SBIS (Tensor)](https://sbis.ru/). For instructions on how to connect, visit the operator's website. {{ yandex-cloud }} does not partner with other operators and does not support roaming.

1. Sign an agreement from {{ yandex-cloud }} in your profile on the EDM operator's website.

    {% note info %}

    To receive the agreement faster, [fill out the form](https://forms.yandex.ru/surveys/10035776.0ccf604a1212deccbba466c182a895d369193f38/) by specifying the INN/TIN and KPP of your business, and the name of your EDM operator.

    {% endnote %}

    {{ yandex-cloud }} sends out agreements for enabling EDM twice a month (from the 10th to the 13th and from the 25th to the 28th) if you:
    * Use {{ yandex-cloud }} services and have at least one [report](../concepts/act.md) generated for you over the past six months.
    * Are connected to the [Diadoc (SKB Kontur)](https://kontur-inc.com/diadoc) or [SBIS (Tensor)](https://sbis.ru/) EDM operator.
    * Have not signed an agreement from {{ yandex-cloud }} yet.

After signing the agreement, you'll start receiving documents from {{ yandex-cloud }}. These are documents generated no earlier than the date of delivery of the signed agreement to the EDM internal IT service. They will be automatically sent to you via EDM before the deadline stipulated in the service agreement.

The originals of the documents generated before you sign the agreement are only sent to your physical address by Russian Post.

You can find the details of the receiving party's signatories of the agreement in your profile on the operator's website. If no information is available, contact the operator's technical support.

{{ yandex-cloud }} does not handle issues reported through user profiles on the operator's website. If you have a question, please contact [technical support]({{ link-console-support }}).
