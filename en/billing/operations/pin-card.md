# Link another bank card to your billing account

The owner of a billing account of a **Individual account** or **Business account** may link several bank cards to it.
Funds for the resources consumed will only be debited from the bank card that you select yourself on the billing account page.

If the selected bank card expires, it will no longer be linked to your billing account. If you have already received a new bank card, add it or select one of the previously added bank cards. You can't change the details of a previously added bank card.
