# Link a cloud to a billing account

{% include [pin-cloud-note](../_includes/pin-cloud-note.md) %}

## Requirements for linking a cloud

Before linking a cloud, make sure that the billing account has been activated (the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status) and that the user has the following roles:
* [resource-manager.clouds.owner](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#owner) in the cloud.
* `billing.accounts.owner` or `editor` in the billing account. Read more about roles in [Access management](../security/index.md#role-list).

{% note info %}

If the billing account status is `SUSPENDED`, then the cloud status automatically switches to `SUSPENDED` when linked.

{% endnote %}
