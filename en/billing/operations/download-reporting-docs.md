# Download reporting documents through the console

Companies and individual entrepreneurs can download [reports](../concepts/act.md) and [invoices](../concepts/invoice.md) in the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console.

Documents are generated in [Yandex.Balance](https://balance.yandex.com/) on the last day of the month. Seven business days after a reporting period closes, the relevant documents will be posted to the management console and will become available for download. Documents for previous reporting periods are also available in the management console.

To download reporting documents:

1. In the management console, go to [Billing]({{ link-console-billing }}).
1. On the **List of accounts** page, select a billing account.
1. Go to **Reporting documents**.
1. In the line for the relevant reporting period, click ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) → **Download**. A window will open showing the reporting documents for the selected period.
1. To the right of a document, click ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) → **Open**. The document will open in a new browser tab and will be available for saving.
