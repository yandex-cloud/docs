# Activate the paid version

You need to activate the paid version within thirty days after the trial period ends, otherwise all of your resources are deleted automatically.

If you didn't spend the entire amount of the [initial grant](../concepts/bonus-account.md) in the trial period, you can use the remaining amount in the future to pay for resources consumed.

To upgrade to the paid version:
1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-billing }}), click ![image](../../_assets/ugly-sandwich.svg) and go to **Billing**.
2. Select an account on the **List of accounts** page.
3. On the **Overview** page, click **Upgrade to the paid version**.
4. Confirm the action by clicking **Upgrade to the paid version** again.

Once you activate the paid version, your [personal account balance](../concepts/personal-account.md#balance) is set to zero by default. We recommend monitoring and [topping up](../operations/pay-the-bill.md) your personal account balance so that it is always positive.
<br/>If you fail to top up your account balance on time and incur arrears, your {{ yandex-cloud }} account may be suspended. For more information, see [How to pay for resources](../payment/index.md).
