# Activate the paid version

You need to activate the paid version within thirty days after the trial period ends. Otherwise, all of your resources are deleted automatically.

If you have not spent the full amount of the [initial grant](../concepts/bonus-account.md) during the trial period, you can use its balance to pay for the resources you will consume in the future.

To upgrade to the paid version:
1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-billing }}), click ![image](../../_assets/main-menu.svg) and select **{{ billing-name }}**.
1. Select an account on the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.label_accounts }}** page.
1. On the ![image](../../_assets/billing/flag.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.switch_overview }}** page, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.button_billing-payment-action }}**.
1. Confirm the action by clicking **{{ ui-key.yacloud.billing.account.button_billing-payment-action }}** again.


Once you activate the paid version, your [personal account balance](../concepts/personal-account.md#balance) is set to zero by default. We recommend monitoring and [topping up](../operations/pay-the-bill.md) your personal account balance so that it is always positive.
<br/>If you fail to top up your account balance on time and incur a debt, your {{ yandex-cloud }} account may be suspended. For more information, see **Billing cycle**:
