# Pricing policy


In {{ yandex-cloud }}, you can use resources of both billable and non-billable services.

## Non-billable services {#free}

The [Yandex Identity and Access Management](../iam/pricing.md) and [Yandex Resource Manager](../resource-manager/pricing.md) services are always free of charge.

## Fees for individual services {#billable}

Billable service costs are calculated based on the resources consumed and time used. Each service implements its own logic for calculating the volume of resources consumed.

For more information about {{ yandex-cloud }} pricing as well as pricing rules for all services, see the [Pricing](https://cloud.yandex.ru/prices) page.
