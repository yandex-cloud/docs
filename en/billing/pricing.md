# Pricing policy

In Yandex.Cloud, you can use resources of both billable and non-billable services.

## Non-billable services {#free}

The [Yandex Identity and Access Management](../iam/pricing.md) and [Yandex Resource Manager](../resource-manager/pricing.md) services are always free of charge.

## Fees for individual services {#billable}

Billable service costs are calculated based on the resources consumed and usage timeframe. Each service implements its own logic for calculating the volume of resources consumed.

For more information about Yandex.Cloud pricing as well as pricing rules for all services, see the [Pricing](https://cloud.yandex.com/prices) page.
