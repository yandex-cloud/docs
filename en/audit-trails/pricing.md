### Examples of cost calculation {#price-example}

##### Example 1

  Calculating the cost of delivering the events of receiving the contents of a {{ lockbox-full-name }} secret encrypted with the {{ kms-full-name }} encryption key:
  * Each time a secret is accessed, two events are delivered: the event of [accessing](./concepts/events-data-plane.md#lockbox) the {{ lockbox-short-name }} secret contents and the event of [decrypting](./concepts/events-data-plane.md#kms) the secret contents using the {{ kms-short-name }} key.
  * Number of times the secret is accessed: 7,000.





  
  {% include [usd-lockbox](../_pricing_examples/audit-trails/usd-lockbox.md) %}


##### Example 2

  Calculating the cost of delivering events when using {{ objstorage-full-name }} buckets.

  Total number of delivered events: 25,000. Out of which:
  * Number of [management](./concepts/events.md#objstorage) events transmitted when using buckets: 1,000.
      This includes the events of creating and deleting buckets, changing access policies, and ACL and encryption settings.

  * Number of [data](./concepts/events-data-plane.md#objstorage) events transmitted when using buckets: 24,000.
      This includes the events of creating objects in buckets and changing object tags.
