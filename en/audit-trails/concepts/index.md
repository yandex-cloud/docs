# {{ at-full-name }} overview

{{ at-full-name }} lets you collect audit logs of {{ yandex-cloud }} resources and upload them to a {{ objstorage-name }} bucket or {{ cloud-logging-name }} log group:

* [Uploading audit logs to a bucket](../operations/index.md#bucket).
* [Uploading audit logs to Cloud Logging](../operations/index.md#logging).
* [Uploading audit logs to a data stream](../operations/index.md#data-streams).

Collecting audit logs lets you use analytical tools and rapidly respond to events that occur to {{ yandex-cloud }} services:

* [Searching audit logs in a bucket](../tutorials/search-bucket.md)
* [Searching audit logs in a log group](../tutorials/search-cloud-logging.md)
* [Exporting audit logs to SIEM systems](./export-siem.md)
* [Alert settings in {{ monitoring-full-name }}](../tutorials/alerts-monitoring.md)

{{ yandex-cloud }} services whose audit logs are collected by {{ at-name }}:

* {{ at-full-name }}

## Current service limits {#known-restrictions}

The audit log doesn't capture authentication errors. For example, if a user makes an API call without an IAM token, this information will not be included in the audit logs.

The log captures authorization errors. For example, if a user attempts to create a resource without sufficient privileges, the log will include an error message.

The service also has [quotas and limits](limits.md).
