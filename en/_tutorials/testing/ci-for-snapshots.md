# Creating test VMs via {{ GL }} CI

You can use {{ yandex-cloud }} to automate routine tasks, such as running a specific script after each commit in the `master` branch in a Git repository. The example below creates and tests a [VM](../../compute/concepts/vm.md) following each commit.

To configure new Continuous Integration (CI) for VM [disk snapshots](../../compute/concepts/snapshot.md):
1. [Create a VM for the test application](#create-vm): create a new VM whose disk snapshot will be used to create new VMs via CI.
1. [Set the VM up with a test application](#configure-vm): deploy a web server and components to support the test application to the VM. Write a test application that will reverse the words in a text sent to the server.
1. [Check how the application works](#test-app): send a test request to check the server settings and the results.
1. [Create a VM disk snapshot](#create-snapshot): create a VM disk snapshot for CI to use to create new VMs.
1. [Create a VM with {{ GL }}](#create-gitlab-vm): create a VM with [{{ GL }}](https://about.gitlab.com/) to store CI settings and a functionality test script in a repository.
1. [Configure {{ GL }}](#configure-gitlab): create a file repository and get the parameters required for configuration.
1. [Configure Runner](#configure-runner): a tool for performing tasks.
1. [Configure CI](#configure-ci): set the CI configuration by specifying the necessary parameters for commands and testing.
1. [Check that the application runs on the VM created using CI](#test-new-vm): make sure that the VMs you are trying to create with CI and the VM snapshot have been created and the test application is functional.

If you no longer need the created VMs, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Prepare your cloud {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

Before creating a VM:
1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) {{ yandex-cloud }} and select the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) to perform your steps in.
1. Make sure the selected folder has a [network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) with a [subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) you can connect the VM to. To do this, select **{{ vpc-name }}** on the folder page. If the list contains a network, click on its name to see the list of subnets. If there is neither network nor subnet, [create them](../../vpc/quickstart.md).

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost of this infrastructure includes:
* A fee for continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for storing created images (see [{{ compute-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md#prices-storage)).
* A charge for using dynamic public IPs (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).

{% endif %}

## Create a VM for the test application {#create-vm}

Create a VM to deploy the test application to, a set of components required for it to run, and a web server:
1. On the folder page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter the VM name as `ci-tutorial-test-app`.
1. Select an [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to place the VM in.
1. Under **Image/boot disk selection**, go to the **{{ marketplace-name }}** tab and select a public [Ubuntu 18.04](/marketplace/products/yc/ubuntu-18-04-lts) image.
1. In the **Computing resources** section, select the following configuration:
   * **Platform**: Intel Ice Lake.
   * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 20%.
   * **vCPU**: 2.
   * **RAM**: 1 GB.
1. In **Network settings**, select the subnet to connect the VM to once it is created.
1. Enter the VM access information:
   * Enter the username in the **Login** field.
   * To the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the public key file.

     You need to [create](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys) the SSH key pair yourself. To create keys, use third-party tools, such as `ssh-keygen` (on Linux or macOS) or [PuTTYgen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) (on Windows).
1. Click **Create VM**.

The VM may take several minutes to create. When the VM status changes to `RUNNING`, you can start configuring it.

Once created, the VM is assigned an [IP address and a host name (FQDN)](../../vpc/concepts/address.md). This data can be used for SSH access.

## Prepare a VM with the test application {#configure-vm}

On the created VM, deploy a collection of components required for the test application to run and a web server to handle requests. The application will be written in Python 2.
1. Under **Network** on the VM page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) find the VM's public IP address.
1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to the VM via SSH. You can use the `ssh` utility in Linux or macOS, or [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) in Windows.

   ```bash
   ssh <Login>@<VM_public_IP>
   ```

1. Run the `apt update` command to update the lists of packages available for installation.
1. Install the necessary packages (jq JSON processor, git client, PIP package manager, virtualenv virtual environment management system, the set of header files for Python C API, and the nginx web server):

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get --yes install jq git python-pip virtualenv python-dev nginx-full
   ```

1. Create a directory to host the application. In addition, change the ownership of the directory to the user under which you will be connecting to the VM:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /srv/test-app
   sudo chown -R $USER /srv/test-app
   ```

1. Go to the folder and create a `virtualenv` virtual environment in it:

   ```bash
   cd /srv/test-app
   virtualenv test-venv
   ```

1. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   . test-venv/bin/activate
   ```

1. Install the Flask framework and the uWSGI web server in the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pip install flask uwsgi
   ```

1. Deactivate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

1. Create the `api.py` file in the `/srv/test-app` folder:

   ```bash
   touch api.py
   ```

1. Open the `api.py` file using any text editor, and insert the Python code that:
   * Accepts a text string as input in the `text` parameter.
   * Writes each word from the passed string in the opposite order.
   * Returns a response:
     * In JSON format, if the client application can accept JSON.
     * In plain text if the client application does not accept JSON.

   ```python
   # api.py
   import json
   from flask import Flask, request, make_response as response

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route("/")
   def index():
       text = request.args.get('text')
       json_type = 'application/json'
       json_accepted = json_type in request.headers.get('Accept', '')
       if text:
           words = text.split()
           reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]
           if json_accepted:
               res = response(json.dumps({'text': reversed_words}), 200)
           else:
               res = response(' '.join(reversed_words), 200)
       else:
           res = response('text not found', 501)
       res.headers['Content-Type'] = json_type if json_accepted else 'text/plain'
       return res
   ```

1. Create the `wsgi.py` file in the `/srv/test-app` folder:

   ```bash
   touch wsgi.py
   ```

1. Open the `wsgi.py` file using any text editor and insert the code that runs the test application:

   ```python
   # wsgi.py
   from api import app

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run()
   ```

1. Create the `test-app.ini` file in the `/srv/test-app` folder:

   ```bash
   touch test-app.ini
   ```

1. Open the `test-app.ini` file using any text editor and insert the configuration of the uWSGI server:

   ```ini
   #test-app.ini
   [uwsgi]
   module = wsgi:app

   master = true
   processes = 1

   socket = test-app.sock
   chmod-socket = 660
   vacuum = true

   die-on-term = true
   ```

1. Assign the `www-data` user as the owner of the `/srv/test-app` folder and the files it contains:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /srv/test-app
   ```

1. Prepare the service to start your uWSGI server. To do this, make the `/etc/systemd/system/test-app.service` file look like this:

   ```ini
   #/etc/systemd/system/test-app.service
   [Unit]
   Description=uWSGI instance to serve test API
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=www-data
   Group=www-data
   WorkingDirectory=/srv/test-app
   Environment="PATH=/srv/test-app/test-venv/bin"
   ExecStart=/srv/test-app/test-venv/bin/uwsgi --ini test-app.ini

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

1. Specify the settings of the new virtual server in the nginx configuration by making the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/test-app.conf` file look like this:

   ```nginx
   #/etc/nginx/sites-available/test-app.conf
   server {
       #server_name test-app.yandex www.test-app.yandex;

       listen 80;

       location /test/ {
           include uwsgi_params;
           uwsgi_param SCRIPT_NAME /test;
           uwsgi_modifier1 30;
           uwsgi_pass unix:/srv/test-app/test-app.sock;
       }
   }
   ```

1. Create a symbolic link that points to the Nginx configuration file `test-app.conf`:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/test-app.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

1. Delete the symbolic link that points to the default Nginx configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
   ```

1. Add the service to the system autorun list:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable test-app.service
   ```

## Check that the test application is working {#test-app}

To make sure the test application is functional and the web server is properly configured, send a simple request.
1. In the browser bar, enter the URL for testing the web server and application:

   ```http
   http://<VM_public_IP>/test/?text=hello_world
   ```

1. If everything is working, the screen will display text with reversed words from the `text` parameter.

## Take a snapshot of the VM disk {#create-snapshot}

To easily transfer the app and the web server configuration you created to VMs spawned with CI, you will need to take a snapshot of the test VM's disk.
1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) {{ yandex-cloud }}, select the folder you created your VM in.
1. Select **{{ compute-name }}**.
1. Find and select the VM called `ci-tutorial-test-app`.
1. Click **Stop**.
1. In the window that opens, click **Stop**.
1. After stopping the VM, select the **Disks** tab.
1. In the row with the desired disk, click ![vertical-ellipsis](../../_assets/vertical-ellipsis.svg) and select **Create snapshot**.
1. In the window that opens, enter a name for the snapshot: `test-app-snap`.
1. Click **Create snapshot**.

## Create a VM with {{ GL }} {#create-gitlab-vm}

One of the ways to set up CI in {{ yandex-cloud }} is to take advantage of a public image with {{ GL }} pre-installed. {{ GL }} includes a set of tools for managing Git repositories and configuring CI.
1. On the folder page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter the VM name as follows: `ci-tutorial-gitlab`.
1. Select an [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to place the VM in.
1. Under **Image/boot disk selection**, click the **{{ marketplace-name }}** tab and select [{{ GL }}](/marketplace/products/yc/gitlab) as your image.
1. In the **Computing resources** section, select the following configuration:
   * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 100%.
   * **vCPU**: 2.
   * **RAM**: 2 GB.
1. In **Network settings**, select the subnet to connect the VM to once it is created.
1. Enter the VM access information:
   * Enter the username in the **Login** field.
   * To the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the public key file.

     You need to [create](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys) the SSH key pair yourself. To create keys, use third-party tools, such as `ssh-keygen` (on Linux or macOS) or [PuTTYgen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) (on Windows).
1. Click **Create VM**.

The VM may take several minutes to create. When the VM status changes to `RUNNING`, you can start configuring it.

Once created, the VM is assigned an [IP address and a host name (FQDN)](../../vpc/concepts/address.md). This data can be used for SSH access.

## Configure {{ GL }} {#configure-gitlab}

To set {{ GL }} up and configure the CI process, create a new project and enter the CI login credentials:
1. On the {{ compute-name }} page, select the created VM and copy its public IP.
1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to the VM via SSH.
1. Get the {{ GL }} administrator password using the VM command:

   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
   ```

1. Copy the password (without spaces) from the `Password` row to the clipboard or a separate file.
1. In the browser, open a link in the format `http://<public VM IP address>`. The {{ GL }} web interface will open.
1. Log in using the administrator account:
   * **Username or email**: `root`.
   * **Password**: The previously copied password.

   If you are unable to log in, [reset the administrator account password](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/reset_user_password.html#reset-your-root-password).

1. Under **Set up a specific Runner automatically**, you will see the **server address** to connect to and the **token** for registering the server in the project. Use these values when registering Runner.

## Configure Runner {#configure-runner}

Runner is a tool for performing tasks that a user creates. You need to deploy Runner to the VM and register it in {{ GL }}. For Runner to be able to perform tasks, set up additional components: install the {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI and create a test to check the created VM.
1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to the VM with {{ GL }} over SSH:

   ```bash
   ssh <Login>@<public_IP_of_VM_with_{{ GL }}>
   ```

1. Add the new repository to the package manager:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-runner/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
   ```

1. Install the Runner that will run your CI scripts:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get -y install gitlab-runner
   ```

1. Register the Runner:
   * When you get to `Please enter the gitlab-ci coordinator URL`, specify the {{ GL }} server address.
   * In the step `Please enter the gitlab-ci token for this runner`, specify the Runner token.
   * In the step `Please enter the gitlab-ci description for this runner`, enter the description `gitlab test runner`.
   * In the step `Please enter the gitlab-ci tags for this runner`, don't type anything. Press **Enter**.
   * In the step `Please enter the executor`, specify `shell`.

   ```bash

   <token-Runner>
   Please enter the gitlab-ci description for this runner:
   [ci-tutorial-gitlab]: gitlab test runner
   Please enter the gitlab-ci tags for this runner (comma separated):

   Registering runner... succeeded                     runner=wZqzyy9s
   Please enter the executor: virtualbox, docker+machine, docker-ssh+machine, kubernetes, docker, docker-ssh, shell, ssh, parallels:
   shell
   Runner registered successfully. Feel free to start it, but if it's running already the config should be automatically reloaded!
   ```

1. For the CI script to be able to create VMs, please install the {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI:

   ```bash
   curl https://{{ s3-storage-host }}{{ yc-install-path }} --output install.sh
   sudo bash install.sh -n -i /opt/yc
   ```

1. To perform functional testing, install the `pytest` package:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python-pytest
   ```

1. Create the `test.py` file with the functional testing script:
   1. Open the home page of the `gitlab-test` repository.
   1. Click **+** and choose **New file**.
   1. In the window that opens, give the file the name `test.py`.
   1. Copy the following code to the file body:

      ```python
      # test.py
      import pytest
      import json
      import socket as s

      @pytest.fixture
      def hostname(request):
          with open("instance-creation.out", "r") as fd:
              fqdn = json.loads(fd.read()).get("fqdn")

          return fqdn

      @pytest.fixture
      def socket(request):
          _socket = s.socket(s.AF_INET, s.SOCK_STREAM)
          def socket_teardown():
              _socket.close()
          request.addfinalizer(socket_teardown)
          return _socket

      def test_server_connect(socket, hostname):
          socket.connect((hostname, 80))
          assert socket
      ```

   1. Write any commit message and click **Commit changes**.

## Configure CI {#configure-ci}

You need to define the configuration for CI.
1. Open the home page of the `gitlab-test` repository.

   ```http
   http://<public_IP_of_VM_with_{{ GL }}>/root/gitlab-test
   ```

1. Click **Set up CI/CD**. You will see the screen for adding a new file.
1. {{ GL }} will automatically name the file `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Do not rename it. Copy the following configuration to the file:

   ```yaml
   #.gitlab-ci.yml
   stages:
     - build
     - test

   build:
     stage: build
     variables:
       snapshot_name: test-app-snap
       folder_id: <folder ID>
       subnet_name: <subnet name>
     script:
       - export instance_name="ci-tutorial-test-app-$(date +%s)"
       - export PATH="/opt/yc/bin:${PATH}"
       - yc config set token $YC_OAUTH
       - yc compute instance create
         --format json
         --name $instance_name
         --folder-id $folder_id
         --zone {{ region-id }}-a
         --network-interface subnet-name=$subnet_name,nat-ip-version=ipv4
         --create-boot-disk name=$instance_name-boot,type=network-ssd,size=15,snapshot-name=$snapshot_name,auto-delete=true
         --memory 1
         --cores 1
         --hostname $instance_name > instance-creation.out
       - sleep 30
     artifacts:
       when: on_success
       paths:
       - instance-creation.out
       expire_in: 10 mins

   test_external:
     stage: test
     script:
       - py.test test.py > pytest-external.out
     artifacts:
       paths:
       - pytest-external.out
       expire_in: 1 hour
   ```

1. In the `snapshot_name` field, enter the name of the first VM snapshot.
   In the `folder_id` field, specify the ID of the folder where VMs are created.
   In the `subnet_name` field, specify the name of the subnet that the VMs will connect to. You can retrieve the name in the management console by opening the appropriate folder and going to the {{ vpc-name }} service page.
1. Click **Commit changes**.

## Check how the application works on the VM created using CI {#test-new-vm}

After the commit, you need to make sure that CI worked correctly. The desired folder should display a new VM where the test application and the web server are deployed.

To test the created VM:
1. Open the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console.
1. In the folder where the VMs were created, select **{{ compute-name }}**.
1. If everything has been properly configured, the VM list should display a new VM named something like `ci-tutorial-test-app-1543910277`.
1. Select the created VM and copy the created VM's public address.
1. In the browser, open a link in this format:

   ```http
   http://<public_IP_of_created_VM>/test/?text=hello_world
   ```

1. The application created in the previous steps should also function on the created VM and return the inverted words from the `text` parameter.

### Delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

If you no longer need the VMs and images:
* [Delete the created VMs](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md).
* [Delete the created images](../../compute/operations/image-control/delete.md).
