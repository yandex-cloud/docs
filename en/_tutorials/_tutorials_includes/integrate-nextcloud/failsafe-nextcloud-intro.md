You will deploy a fault-tolerant Nextcloud configuration in a group of three VMs, the load on Nextcloud hosts distributed with the help of an L7 {{ alb-full-name }}. The service database will reside in a three-host {{ MY }} cluster. Hosts of the instance group, load balancer, and {{ MY }} cluster will be evenly distributed across three [availability zones](../../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md). Nextcloud will be available via the domain name, for which a TLS certificate will be issued in {{ certificate-manager-name }}.
