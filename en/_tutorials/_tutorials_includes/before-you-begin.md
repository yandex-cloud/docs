Before you start, sign up for {{ yandex-cloud }} and create a billing account:

1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and log in to {{ yandex-cloud }} or register if you don't have an account yet.
1. [On the billing page]({{ link-console-billing }}), make sure you linked a [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you don't have a billing account, [create one](../../billing/quickstart/index.md).

If you have an active billing account, you can go to the [cloud page]({{ link-console-cloud }}) to create or select a folder to run your infrastructure.
