{% note warning %}

If you are creating a file in Windows, make sure that newline characters are in `\n` Unix format rather than `\r\n`. You can replace line breaks in a text editor, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), or with such tools as [dos2unix](https://waterlan.home.xs4all.nl/dos2unix.html) or [Tofrodos](https://www.thefreecountry.com/tofrodos/).
