# Analyzing Yandex Music podcast statistics (for podcasters)

A podcast from Yandex Music that you have access to will serve as your data source.
Podcast analytics let you retrieve statistics and analyze podcast listening and subscriber data in Yandex Music. To work with podcast analytics, you must have access to one or more podcasts.

To visualize and analyze the data, follow these steps:

1. [Set up a connection](#configure-connection).

   1. [Edit the chart](#changing-chart).
   1. [Create a new chart and add it to the dashboard](#creating-chart).
1. [Share podcast analytics with other users](#share-analytics).
   1. [Grant access to DataLens](#open-access).
   1. [Share analytics on a particular podcast or episode](#share-analytics-on-podcast-or-episode).
      1. [Restrict shared access](#restrict-access).
      1. [Restrict access to data (podcasts/episodes)](#provide-access-to-podcast).
      1. [Grant access to your DataLens instance](#access-to-datalens-instance).

1. [Add a chart or dashboard to your website](#add-dashboard-chart).

We recommend that you review the [Questions and answers](#qa) section to help you get answers to the most common questions users of Yandex Music podcast statistics may have.

## 1. Set up a connection {#configure-connection}

### 1.1 Set up {{ datalens-short-name }} {#before-you-begin}

{{ datalens-full-name }} is deployed on the {{ yandex-cloud }} platform.

Set up {{ datalens-short-name }} based on your experience:

* You're a new user (you only want to use {{ datalens-full-name }} for podcast analysis).
* You're already using {{ datalens-full-name }} (for other purposes).

{% include [before-you-begin](../includes/before-you-begin-datalens.md) %}

### 1.2. Create a connection {#create-connection}

{% note warning %}

Only users with privileges to a Yandex Music podcast are able to create connections and process podcast analytics. If you don't have access to any podcast, no data will be displayed on the dashboard.

You will get access after uploading a podcast to Yandex Music. The podcast is linked to the Yandex email address specified when uploading it.

{% endnote %}

1. Follow the link you received in the email and fill out the form for your connection.
1. Enter a name for the connection like **My Podcast** (it can be anything).
1. Click **Get key**. If this is your first time creating a connection to Yandex Music podcasts, grant the service the required permissions.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/30-get-key-oauth.png)

1. Click **Check connection**.
1. After successfully checking the connection, click **Create**.
1. Go to the **Dashboards** menu and open the **Yandex Music podcast analytics** dashboard. If there isn't any data, please make sure your current account has podcast access by writing to [technical support](https://yandex.com/support/music/podcast-authors/statistics.html).

### 1.3. Review podcast statistics in {{ datalens-short-name }} {#podcasts-in-datalens}

1. When the connection is created, a folder containing a set of standard objects that your statistics are based on opens:

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/02-dashboard.png =20x20) The **Yandex Music podcast analytics** dashboard is the primary page for viewing statistics and has all the widgets (charts, tables, and filters) available. To quickly access the dashboard, save the page link to a convenient location.

   {% cut "Other objects" %}

   * ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/04-music-connection.png =20x20) A connection is a set of parameters for accessing podcast data. This is the key that the user needs to open the statistics.
   * ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/03-datasets.png =20x20) Datasets are sets of dimensions and measures that are used for creating charts.
      * Dataset **D01. Podcast listens**: A dataset with listening statistics.
      * Dataset **D02. Podcast subscribers**: A dataset with data on subscribers.
   * ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/01-charts.png =20x20) Charts are sets of individual visualizations in the form of diagrams and tables used on the dashboard.
   * ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/02-dashboard.png =20x20) The **Metrica Live Demo Dashboard** and the **Sales Dashboard** are demos that may open in your connection. You can delete them if you wish.

   {% endcut %}

1. Open the **Yandex Music podcast analytics** dashboard.
   1. The dashboard contains four tabs:
   * Listens: General listening statistics, listening dynamics, statistics on the number of times individual episodes were listened to, and distribution of listening by day of week and time of day.
   * Audience: Podcast audience statistics, including socio-demographic data on listeners.
   * Subscribers: Audience statistics, subscribe/unsubscribe dynamics, and socio-demographic data on subscribers.
   * Reference: A reference on estimated measures and terms used in data and dashboards.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/05-music-dashboard-example.png)

   1. Each tab contains:
   * Text widgets are headers, comments, and hints.
   * Selectors: Filters by different dimensions that can be used to filter the contents of dashboards.
   * Charts: Graphs, tables, and other visualizations.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/06-dashboard-elements.png)

You can edit it and add standard objects as you wish. For example, delete an unnecessary chart from the dashboard or add a new one, change an existing chart, or add a selector to the dashboard.

## 2. Edit a dashboard and chart, and create new ones {#edit-dashboard-chart}

### 2.1. Edit a dashboard {#changing-dashboard}

You can change the order of charts and selectors, increase or decrease them, discard some data and, vice versa, put together the most necessary information. Try to edit the dashboard after making a copy of it:

1. In the menu on the left, go to the **Dashboards** section.
1. Next to the **Yandex Music podcast analytics** dashboard, click ![image](../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis-black.svg) and select **Copy**.
1. Open the dashboard copy and go to the **Audience** tab.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/07-delete-chart.png)

1. Try to position the **Listener gender** and **Listener age** charts so that they fill in the empty space left after deleting the chart in the previous step.
   1. Drag the chart by clicking on the chart itself. Resize the chart using the triangle in the lower-right corner.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/08-change-chart-size.png)

1. Click **Add** and choose **Selector**.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/09-add-selector.png)

1. Open the **Yandex Music podcast analytics** dashboard and click the **Listens** tab.
1. Scroll the dashboard down to the **Listening time by time of day** chart.
1. Click ![image](../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis-black.svg) in the upper-right corner of the chart and select **Edit**.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/12-edit-dashboard.png)

1. The chart configuration area (wizard) consists of three main parts:
   * A selection panel with a list of available dimensions and measures for creating a chart.
   * A visualization settings panel with various sections that you can use to configure your chart.
   * Chart preview.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/13-chart-elements.png)

1. Delete the **Listening date and time** dimension from the **Colors** section.
1. Add a dimension named **Gender** to the **Colors** section.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/14-add-field.png)

1. Select a different visualization type: **Normalized column chart**.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/15-bar-chart.png)

1. Now, each column shows the relative distribution of **Listeners** by **Gender** in terms of **Time of day**. Click **Save** in the upper-right corner of the chart.

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/16-chart-result.png)

Refresh the dashboard page to apply the chart changes.

### 2.3. Create a new chart and add it to the dashboard {#creating-chart}

   ![image](../../_assets/datalens/solution-10/24-share-access.png)

{% note info %}

The user will be able to view statistics immediately, and you can set up additional permissions for the user's account in a few hours.

Permissions can be set up for each object separately. Learn more about [permissions in {{ datalens-short-name }}](../../datalens/security/index.md).

{% endnote %}

### 3.2. Share analytics on a particular podcast or episode {#share-analytics-on-podcast-or-episode}

You can grant a user, such as a partner or advertiser, access not to the entire dashboard with podcaster statistics, but to statistics for an individual podcast or episode. For that, the user will also need a Yandex account.

For a user to be able to request data on an episode via charts but not view or edit connection or dataset settings, [restrict shared access](#restrict-access).

Then grant the user access to the objects: **Podcasts Analytics. Connection**, **D01. Podcast listens** and **D02. Podcast subscribers**. Specify which podcast or episode you grant access to.

#### 3.2.1. Restrict shared access {#restrict-access}

To restrict shared access:

1. In the window that opens, select the connection **Podcasts Analytics. Connection**. Click ![image](../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) → **Access rights**.
1. Click on the All group and set the permissions to **Execute**. Shared access will be restricted: other users will be able to view statistics on the dashboard, for example, only for individual episodes, but won't be able to change these settings.

Repeat the action for datasets **D01. Podcast listens** and **D02. Podcast subscribers**.
If you don't want to share podcast subscriber analytics with users, you can revoke permission of dataset **D02. Podcast subscribers** for the All group.

#### 3.2.2. Restrict access to data (podcasts/episodes) {#provide-access-to-podcast}

When setting up permissions to individual podcasts and episodes, specify the following:

* The users who will be granted permissions to a podcast or episode.

## Questions and answers {#qa}

{% cut "Why can you only connect with a Yandex account?" %}

Using a Yandex account in Yandex Music and {{ datalens-short-name }} ensures high data security.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "I know for a fact that some of my friends have listened to the podcast but the statistics show a lower number. Why?" %}

Data is updated daily at 13:00. If someone listens to a podcast after this time, the data will only appear in the statistics the next day. Playbacks of less than 1 second are not included in the statistics.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "There are more service subscribers than DataLens shows. Why?" %}

New subscribers appear in the service instantly, while in the statistics only the next day. If a person subscribes to a podcast today, the number of subscribers in the statistics will increase tomorrow.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Why are some of my podcast episodes not included in the statistics?" %}

The statistics only show episodes that are already listened to. If you don't see a certain episode at the moment, it will appear on charts later as soon as it is listened to for the first time.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Are editorial promos shown in the statistics?" %}

Promo periods and titles aren't displayed in the statistics separately, but a sharp increase in listens may indicate that the podcast was promoted.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Can I edit a standard dashboard?" %}

Yes, you can edit the dashboard and related objects.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "I deleted a dashboard accidentally. How do I restore it?" %}

Re-create a connection and the dashboard will expand again.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Why are chart settings so complicated?" %}

{{ datalens-short-name }} is a full-fledged data analysis and visualization tool. Use its rich set of settings to create different types of visualizations that meet a variety of user requirements.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "What else can I use DataLens for?" %}

You are not restricted to using {{ datalens-short-name }}. You can connect to your own data sources, build charts and dashboards, and share them with your colleagues.

{% endcut %}
