With [{{ TF }}](https://www.terraform.io/), you can quickly create a cloud infrastructure in {{ yandex-cloud }} and manage it using configuration files. They store the infrastructure description in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). {{ TF }} and its providers are distributed under the [Mozilla Public License](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/main/LICENSE).

For more information about the provider resources, see the documentation on the [{{ TF }}](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/yandex/index.html) website or [mirror website]({{ tf-docs-link }}).

If you change the configuration files, {{ TF }} automatically determines which part of your configuration is already deployed and what should be added or removed.
