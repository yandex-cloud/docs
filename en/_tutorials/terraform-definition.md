With [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), you can quickly create a cloud infrastructure in {{ yandex-cloud }} and manage it by configuration files. They store the infrastructure description in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Terraform and its providers are distributed under the [Mozilla Public License](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/main/LICENSE).

For more information about the provider resources, see the documentation on the [Terraform]({{ tf-provider-link }}) site or [mirror](https://registry.tfpla.net/providers/yandex-cloud/yandex/latest/docs) site.

If you change the configuration files, Terraform automatically determines which part of your configuration is already deployed and what should be added or removed.
