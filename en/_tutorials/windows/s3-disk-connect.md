# Mounting a bucket as a disk on Windows

In this tutorial, you will use [rclone](https://rclone.org) to set up synchronization of data between an {{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket and your local desktop. The bucket will be mounted as a disk in Windows.

To mount your bucket as a disk:

1. [Prepare your cloud](#before-begin).
1. [Set up a work environment](#environment-prepare).
1. [Create a service account](#create-sa).
1. [Create a static access key](#create-static-key).
1. [Create a bucket](#bucket-create).
1. [Set up a connection to {{ objstorage-name }}](#rclone-config).
1. [Mount the bucket](#bucket-mount).
1. [Set up the mounting service](#mount-service).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost for bucket support includes:

* Fee for storing data in a bucket (see [{{ objstorage-name }} pricing](../../storage/pricing.md#prices-storage)).
* Fee for data operations (see [{{ objstorage-name }} pricing](../../storage/pricing.md#prices-operations)).

- {{ TF }}

   {% include [terraform-install](../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

   1. Add a section with bucket parameters to the configuration file and enter the bucket name following the [naming conventions](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md#naming):

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "<bucket_name>" {
        bucket = "<bucket_name>"
      }
      ```

      For more information about the `yandex_storage_bucket` resource, see the [{{ TF }} provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/storage_bucket).

   1. Make sure the configuration files are valid.

      1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run the check using this command:

         ```bash
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal will display a list of created resources and their parameters. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Deploy cloud resources.

      1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

         ```bash
         terraform apply
         ```

      1. Confirm the resource creation: type `yes` in the terminal and press **Enter**.

- API

   Use the [create](../../storage/api-ref/Bucket/create.md) REST API method for the [Bucket](../../storage/api-ref/Bucket/index.md) resource, the [BucketService/Create](../../storage/api-ref/grpc/bucket_service.md#Create) gRPC API call, or the [create](../../storage/s3/api-ref/bucket/create.md) S3 API method.

{% endlist %}

## Set up a connection to {{ objstorage-name }} {#rclone-config}

1. Open the command prompt in your working directory as an admin user and run the following command:

   ```powershell
   psexec -i -s cmd.exe
   ```

1. In the console that opens, run `whoami` and make sure that the session has been started by the system user.
1. Go to the working directory and run a configuration session for `rclone`:

   ```powershell
   rclone.exe config
   ```

1. Follow the prompts to create a new connection profile:

   1. Select creation of a new profile: enter `n` in the terminal.
   1. Enter the connection name: `s3-connect`.
   1. Select the storage type: enter `5` in the terminal.
   1. Select a provider: enter `1` in the terminal.
   1. Select manual entry of credentials: enter `1` in the terminal.
   1. Enter the secret key ID in the terminal.
   1. Enter the secret key value in the terminal.
   1. Specify a region: enter `{{ region-id }}` in the terminal.
   1. Specify an endpoint: enter `{{ s3-storage-host }}` in the terminal.
   1. You can leave other settings at defaults: press **Enter** to skip them.

{% note info %}

If required, you can run an advanced connection setup. For this, at the `Edit advanced config?` prompt, enter `y` in the terminal. For more information about advanced settings, see the `rclone` [documentation](https://rclone.org/s3/).

{% endnote %}

## Mount a bucket {#bucket-mount}

1. Check the connection to the bucket. In the same terminal where you configured your connection, run the following command with the bucket name specified:

   ```powershell
   rclone.exe ls s3-connect:<bucket_name>
   ```

   If the configuration is set up correctly, the objects in the bucket will be listed in the console.

1. Mount the bucket to the file system specifying the bucket name and an available drive letter in the file system:

   ```powershell
   rclone.exe mount s3-connect:<bucket_name> <drive_letter>: --vfs-cache-mode full
   ```

   You will see a new disk with the objects from the bucket in Windows Explorer.

1. To mount the bucket, press **Ctrl** + **C**.

## Set up the mounting service {#mount-service}

To mount the bucket at your desktop startup, set up mounting on behalf of the system service.

1. In the working directory, create `rclone.xml` with the following contents:

   ```xml
   <service>
     <id>rclone</id>
     <name>rclone-s3-disk</name>
     <description>This service maps an S3 bucket as a system drive.</description>
     <executable>"<working_directory_path>\rclone.exe"</executable>
     <arguments>mount s3-connect:<bucket_name> <drive_letter>: --vfs-cache-mode full</arguments>
     <log mode="roll" />
     <onfailure action="restart" />
   </service>
   ```

1. Open the command prompt as a system administrator and execute the command:

   ```powershell
   WinSW-x64.exe install .\rclone.xml
   ```

1. Open the Windows services panel and make sure that `rclone-s3-disk` is listed:

   1. Click **Win**+**R**.
   1. In the window that opens, enter `services.msc` and click **OK**.
   1. In the service list, find `rclone-s3-disk`.

1. Reboot your desktop and check that the disk is available.

{% note info %}

You can also set up the service to start on behalf of the system user (for more information, see [Service account](https://github.com/winsw/winsw/blob/v3/docs/xml-config-file.md#service-account) in the `WinSW` utility documentation).

{% endnote %}

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources you created:

* [Delete the objects](../../storage/operations/objects/delete-all.md) from the bucket.
* [Delete the bucket](../../storage/operations/buckets/delete.md).
