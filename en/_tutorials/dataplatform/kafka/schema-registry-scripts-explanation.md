These scripts send and receive messages in the `messages` topic as a `key:value` pair. This example shows the data format schemas in [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) format.

{% note info %}

Python scripts are provided for demonstration only. You can prepare and send data format schemas and the data itself by creating a similar script in another language.
