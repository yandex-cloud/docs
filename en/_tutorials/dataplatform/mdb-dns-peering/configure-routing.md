Configure routing between the `cluster-net` and `vm-net` cloud networks so that any subnet of one network is accessible from any subnet of the other network.

There are several ways to set up this routing. See the [network routing tutorials](../../../tutorials/routing/index.md). For example, you can [create an IPsec tunnel](../../../tutorials/routing/ipsec-vpn.md).
