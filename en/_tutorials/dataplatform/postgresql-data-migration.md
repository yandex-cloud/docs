# Migrating a database from a third-party {{ PG }} cluster to {{ mpg-name }}

There are three ways to migrate data from a third-party _source cluster_ to a {{ mpg-name }} _target cluster_:

* [Transferring data using {{ data-transfer-full-name }}](#data-transfer).

    This method allows you to:

    * Go without creating an intermediate VM or granting online access to your {{ mpg-name }} target cluster.
    * Migrate the database completely without interrupting user service.
    * Migrate from older {{ PG }} versions to newer ones, including upgrading your cluster from {{ PG }} version 15 to 16.

    To use this method, allow connecting to the source cluster from the internet.

    For more information, see [{#T}](../../data-transfer/concepts/use-cases.md).

* [Migrating data using logical replication](#logical-replication).

    [_Logical replication_](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html) uses the [subscriptions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createsubscription.html) mechanism. It allows you to migrate data to the target cluster with minimal downtime.

    Use this method only if, for some reason, it is not possible to migrate data using {{ data-transfer-full-name }}.

* [Transferring data by creating and restoring a logical dump](#backup).

    A _logical dump_ is a file with a set of commands running which one by one you can restore the state of a database. It is created using the `pg_dump` utility. To achieve a full logical dump, before you create it, switch the source cluster to <q>read-only</q>.

    Use this method only if, for some reason, it is not possible to transfer data using any of the above methods.

## Transferring data using {{ data-transfer-full-name }} {#data-transfer}

{% include notitle [PostgreSQL migration with Data Transfer](../../_tutorials/dataplatform/datatransfer/managed-postgresql.md) %}

## Migrating data using logical replication {#logical-replication}

Logical replication is supported as of {{ PG }} version 10. Besides migrating data between the same {{ PG }} versions, logical replication allows you to migrate to newer {{ PG }} versions.

In {{ mpg-name }} clusters, subscriptions can be used by the database owner (a user created together with the cluster) and users with the `mdb_admin` role for the cluster.

Migration stages:

1. [Set up the source cluster](#source-setup).
1. [Export the database schema in the source cluster](#source-schema-export).
1. [Restore the database schema in the target cluster](#restore-schema).
1. [Create a {{ PG }} publication and subscription](#create-publication-subscription).
1. [Migrate the {{ PG }} sequence after replication](#transfer-sequences).
1. [Disable replication and transfer the load](#transfer-load).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out-logical).

### Getting started {#before-you-begin-logical}

Create the required resources:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Manually {#manual}

    Create a [{{ mpg-name }} target cluster](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-create.md) in any suitable configuration. In which case:

    * The {{ PG }} version must be the same or higher than in the source cluster. You cannot perform migration while downgrading {{ PG }} version.
    * When creating a cluster, specify the same database name as in the source cluster.
    * Enable the same [{{ PG }} extensions](../../managed-postgresql/operations/extensions/cluster-extensions.md) as in the source cluster.

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

    1. {% include [terraform-install-without-setting](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/install-without-setting.md) %}
    1. {% include [terraform-authentication](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/authentication.md) %}
    1. {% include [terraform-setting](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/setting.md) %}
    1. {% include [terraform-configure-provider](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/configure-provider.md) %}

    1. Download the [data-migration-pgsql-mpg.tf](https://github.com/yandex-cloud-examples/yc-postgresql-data-migration-from-on-premise/blob/main/data-migration-pgsql-mpg.tf) configuration file to the same working directory.

        This file describes:

        * [Network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network).
        * [Subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).
        * [Security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) and the rule required to connect to a cluster.
        * {{ mpg-name }} cluster with public internet access.

    1. Specify the following in the `data-migration-pgsql-mpg.tf` file:

        * `source_db_name`: Database name.
        * `pg-extensions`: List of [{{ PG }} extensions](../../managed-postgresql/operations/extensions/cluster-extensions.md) in the source cluster.
        * Target cluster parameters:

            * `target_pgsql_version`: {{ PG }} version. Must be the same or higher than in the source cluster.
            * `target_user` and `target_password`: Name and user password of the database owner.

    1. Make sure the {{ TF }} configuration files are correct using this command:

        ```bash
        terraform validate
        ```

        If there are any errors in the configuration files, {{ TF }} will point them out.

    1. Create the required infrastructure:

        {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

        {% include [explore-resources](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/explore-resources.md) %}

{% endlist %}

### Set up the source cluster {#source-setup}

1. Specify the required SSL and WAL settings in the `postgresql.conf` file. In Debian and Ubuntu, the default path to this file is `/etc/postgresql/<{{ PG }}_version>/main/postgresql.conf`.
   1. We recommend using SSL for migrating data: this will help not only encrypt data, but also compress it. For more information, see [SSL Support](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html) and [Database Connection Control Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html) in the {{ PG }} documentation.

      To enable SSL, set the appropriate value in the configuration:

      ```ini
      ssl = on                   # on, off
      ```

   1. Change the logging level for [Write Ahead Log (WAL)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/wal-intro.html) to add the information needed for logical replication. To do this, set the [wal_level](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-WAL-SETTINGS) value to `logical`.

      You can change this setting in `postgresql.conf`. Find the line with the `wal_level` setting, uncomment it as needed, and set it to `logical`:

      ```ini
      wal_level = logical                    # minimal, replica, or logical
      ```

1. Configure authentication of hosts in the source cluster. To do this, add the {{ yandex-cloud }} cluster hosts to the `pg_hba.conf` file (in Debian and Ubuntu distributions, its default path is `/etc/postgresql/<{{ PG }}_version>/main/pg_hba.conf`).

    Add lines to allow connecting to the database from the specified hosts:

    * If you use SSL:

        ```txt
        hostssl         all            all             <host_address>      md5
        hostssl         replication    all             <host_address>      md5
        ```

    * If you do not use SSL:

        ```txt
        host         all            all             <host_address>      md5
        host         replication    all             <host_address>      md5
        ```

1. If a firewall is enabled in the source cluster, allow incoming connections from the {{ mpg-name }} cluster hosts. For example, for Ubuntu 18:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow from <target_cluster_host_address> to any port <port>
   ```

1. Restart the {{ PG }} service to apply all your settings:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart postgresql
   ```

1. Check the {{ PG }} status after restarting:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status postgresql
   ```

### Export the database schema in the source cluster {#source-schema-export}

Use the `pg_dump` utility to create a file with the database schema to apply in the target cluster.

```bash
pg_dump -h <IP_address_or_FQDN_for_master_host_of_source_cluster> \
        -U <username> \
        -p <port> \
        --schema-only \
        --no-privileges \
        --no-subscriptions \
        -d <DB_name> \
        -Fd -f /tmp/db_dump
```

This export command skips all data associated with privileges and roles to avoid conflicts with the database settings in {{ yandex-cloud }}. If your database requires additional users, [create them](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-users.md#adduser).

### Restore the database schema in the target cluster {#restore-schema}

Use the `pg_restore` utility to restore the database schema in the target cluster:

```bash
pg_restore -h <IP_address_or_FQDN_for_master_host_of_target_cluster> \
           -U <username> \
           -p {{ port-mpg }} \
           -Fd -v \
           --single-transaction \
           -s --no-privileges \
           -d <DB_name> /tmp/db_dump
```

### Create a publication and subscription {#create-publication-subscription}

For logical replication to work, create a publication (a group of logically replicated tables) in the source cluster and a subscription (a description of connection to another database) on the target cluster.

1. On the source cluster, create a publication for all the database tables. When migrating multiple databases, you need to create a separate publication for each of them.

   {% note info %}

   You need superuser rights to create publications to all tables, but not to transfer the selected tables. For more information about creating publications, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html).

   {% endnote %}

   Query:

   ```sql
   CREATE PUBLICATION p_data_migration FOR ALL TABLES;
   ```

1. On the {{ mpg-name }} cluster host, create a subscription with the publication connection string. For more information about creating subscriptions, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createsubscription.html).

   Request with SSL enabled:

   ```sql
   CREATE SUBSCRIPTION s_data_migration CONNECTION 'host=<source_cluster_address> port=<port> user=<username> sslmode=verify-full dbname=<DB_name>' PUBLICATION p_data_migration;
   ```

   Without SSL:

   ```sql
   CREATE SUBSCRIPTION s_data_migration CONNECTION 'host=<source_cluster_address> port=<port> user=<username> sslmode=disable dbname=<DB_name>' PUBLICATION p_data_migration;
   ```

1. To get the replication status, check the `pg_subscription_rel` folders. You can get the general replication status via `pg_stat_subscription` for the target cluster, and via `pg_stat_replication` for the source cluster.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_subscription_rel;
   ```

   First of all, check the `srsubstate` field. There, `r` means the synchronization is complete and the databases are ready for replication.

### Transfer {{ PG }} sequences after replication {#transfer-sequences}

To complete synchronization of the source cluster and the target cluster:

1. Switch the source cluster to <q>read-only</q>.
1. Create a dump with {{ PG }}-sequences in the source cluster:

   ```bash
   pg_dump -h <IP_address_or_FQDN_for_master_host_of_source_cluster> \
           -U <username> \
           -p <port> \
           -d <DB_name> \
           --data-only -t '*.*_seq' > /tmp/seq-data.sql
   ```

   Pay attention to the `*.*_seq` pattern used. If the database you are migrating has sequences that do not match this pattern, enter a different pattern to export them.

   For more information about patterns, see the [{{ PG }} documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-PATTERNS).

1. Restore the dump with sequences in the target cluster:

   ```bash
   psql -h <IP_address_or_FQDN_for_master_host_of_target_cluster> \
        -U <username> \
        -p {{ port-mpg }} \
        -d <DB_name> \
        < /tmp/seq-data.sql
   ```

### Delete the subscription and switch over the load {#transfer-load}

1. Delete the subscription in the target cluster:

    ```sql
    DROP SUBSCRIPTION s_data_migration;
   ```

1. Transfer the load to the target cluster.

### Delete the resources you created {#clear-out-logical}

Delete the resources you no longer need to avoid paying for them:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Manually {#manual}

    [Delete the {{ mpg-name }} cluster](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-delete.md).

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

    1. In the terminal window, go to the directory containing the infrastructure plan.
    1. Delete the `data-migration-pgsql-mpg.tf` configuration file.
    1. Make sure the {{ TF }} configuration files are correct using this command:

        ```bash
        terraform validate
        ```

        If there are any errors in the configuration files, {{ TF }} will point them out.

    1. Confirm updating the resources.

        {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

        All the resources described in the `data-migration-pgsql-mpg.tf` configuration file will be deleted.

{% endlist %}

## Transferring data by creating and restoring a logical dump {#backup}

Use `pg_dump` to create a dump of the database in the source cluster. To restore the dump in the target cluster, use `pg_restore`.

{% note info %}

This may require the `pg_repack` database extension.

{% endnote %}

Migration stages:

1. [Create a dump of the database you want to migrate](#dump).
1. [(Optional) Create a virtual machine in {{ yandex-cloud }} and upload the DB dump to it](#create-vm).
1. [Restore data from the dump to the target cluster](#restore).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out-backup).

### Getting started {#before-you-begin-backup}

Create the required resources:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Manually {#manual}

    1. Create a [{{ mpg-name }} target cluster](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-create.md) with any suitable configuration. The following parameters must be the same as in the source cluster:

        * {{ PG }} version
        * Username

            {% include [user-name-restore](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/note-user-name-restore.md) %}

        * [{{ PG }} extensions](../../managed-postgresql/operations/extensions/cluster-extensions.md)

    1. (Optional step) [Create a VM](../../compute/operations/vm-create/create-linux-vm.md) based on [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/marketplace/products/yc/ubuntu-20-04-lts) with the following parameters:

      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_storages }}** → **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.disk-form.field_size }}**: Sufficient to store both archived and unarchived dumps.

            The recommended size is two or more times the total dump and dump archive size.

        * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_network }}**:

            * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.compute.network-select.field_subnetwork }}**: Select a subnet on the cloud network hosting the target cluster.
            * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.compute.network-select.field_external }}**: Select `{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.compute.network-select.switch_auto }}` or one address from a list of reserved IPs.


    1. If you use security groups for the intermediate VM and the {{ mpg-name }} cluster, [configure them](../../managed-postgresql/operations/connect.md#configure-security-groups).


- {{ TF }} {#tf}

    1. {% include [terraform-install-without-setting](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/install-without-setting.md) %}
    1. {% include [terraform-authentication](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/authentication.md) %}
    1. {% include [terraform-setting](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/setting.md) %}
    1. {% include [terraform-configure-provider](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/configure-provider.md) %}

    1. Download the [data-restore-pgsql-mpg.tf](https://github.com/yandex-cloud-examples/yc-postgresql-data-migration-from-on-premise/blob/main/data-restore-pgsql-mpg.tf) configuration file to the same working directory.

        This file describes:

        * [Network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network).
        * [Subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).
        * [Security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) and the rule required to connect to a cluster.
        * {{ mpg-name }} cluster with public internet access.
        * (Optional) Virtual machine with public internet access.

    1. Specify the following in the `data-restore-pgsql-mpg.tf` file:

        * `pg-extensions`: List of [{{ PG }} extensions](../../managed-postgresql/operations/extensions/cluster-extensions.md) in the source cluster.
        * Target cluster parameters:

            * `target_pgsql_version`: {{ PG }} version. Must be the same or higher than in the source cluster.
            * `target_db_name`: Database name.
            * `target_user`: Username of the database owner. It must be the same as the username in the source cluster.

                {% include [user-name-restore](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/note-user-name-restore.md) %}

            * `target_password`: User password of the database owner.
        * (Optional) Virtual machine parameters:

            * `vm_image_id`: ID of the public [image](../../compute/operations/images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list) with Ubuntu without GPU, e.g., for [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/marketplace/products/yc/ubuntu-20-04-lts).
            * `vm_username` and `vm_public_key`: Username and absolute path to the [public key](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys), for access to the VM. By default, the specified username is ignored in the [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/marketplace/products/yc/ubuntu-20-04-lts) image. A user with the `ubuntu` username is created instead. Use it to connect to the instance.

    1. Make sure the {{ TF }} configuration files are correct using this command:

        ```bash
        terraform validate
        ```

        If there are any errors in the configuration files, {{ TF }} will point them out.

    1. Create the required infrastructure:

        {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

        {% include [explore-resources](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/explore-resources.md) %}

{% endlist %}

### Create a database dump {#dump}

1. Switch the database to <q>read-only</q>.
1. Create a dump using the [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) utility. To speed it up, run the utility in multithreaded mode by providing the number of available CPU cores in the `--jobs` argument:

    ```bash
    pg_dump --host=<IP_address_or_FQDN_for_master_host_of_source_cluster> \
            --port=<port> \
            --username=<username> \
            --jobs=<number_of_CPU_cores> \
            --format=d \
            --dbname=<DB_name> \
            --file=db_dump
    ```

### (Optional) Upload the dump to a virtual machine in {{ yandex-cloud }} {#create-vm}

Transfer your data to an intermediate VM in {{ compute-name }} if:

* Your {{ mpg-name }} cluster is not accessible from the internet.
* Your hardware or connection to the cluster in {{ yandex-cloud }} is not very reliable.

The required amount of RAM and processor cores depends on the amount of data to migrate and the required migration speed.

To prepare the virtual machine to restore the dump:

1. In the management console, [create a new VM](../../compute/operations/vm-create/create-linux-vm.md) from an [Ubuntu 20.04](/marketplace/products/yc/ubuntu-20-04-lts) image on **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.image_value_marketplace }}**. The VM parameters depend on the size of the database you want to migrate. The minimum configuration (1 core, 2 GB RAM, 10 GB disk space) should be sufficient to migrate a database up to 1 GB in size. The larger the database, the more RAM and storage space you need for migration (at least twice the size of the database).


    The VM must be in the same network and availability zone as the {{ PG }} cluster. Additionally, the VM must be assigned a public IP address so that you can load the dump from outside {{ yandex-cloud }}.

1. Set up the [{{ PG }} apt repository](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/).

1. Install the {{ PG }} client and additional utilities for working with the DBMS:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install postgresql-client-common && \
    sudo apt install postgresql-client-<{{ PG }}_version>
    ```

1. Archive the dump:

    ```bash
    tar -cvzf db_dump.tar.gz db_dump
    ```

1. Move the archive containing the dump to the VM, e.g., using the `scp` utility:

    ```bash
    scp db_dump.tar.gz <VM_user_name>@<VM_public_address>:/db_dump.tar.gz
    ```

1. [Connect to the VM](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md).

1. Unpack the archive with the dump:

    ```bash
    tar -xzf db_dump.tar.gz
    ```

### Restore data from the dump to the target cluster {#restore}

Restore the database dump using the [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) utility.

The `pg_restore` version must match that of `pg_dump`, and the major version must be at least as high that of the DB the dump will be deployed on.

That is, to restore a dump of {{ PG }} 10, {{ PG }} 11, {{ PG }} 12, {{ PG }} 13, or {{ PG }} 14 use `pg_restore 10`, `pg_restore 11`, `pg_restore 12`, `pg_restore 13`, or `pg_restore 14`, respectively.

```bash
pg_restore --host=<IP_address_or_FQDN_for_master_host_of_target_cluster> \
           --username=<username> \
           --dbname=<DB_name> \
           --port={{ port-mpg }} \
           --format=d \
           --verbose \
           db_dump \
           --single-transaction \
           --no-privileges
```

If you only need to restore a single schema, add the `--schema=<schema_name>` parameter. Without this parameter, the command will only run on behalf of the database owner.

If the restoration fails due to errors related to lack of required permissions for creating and updating extensions, remove the `--single-transaction` parameter from the command. The errors will be ignored in this case:

```text
pg_restore: warning: errors ignored on restore: 3
```

Make sure the errors only apply to the extensions and check the integrity of your restored data.

### Delete the resources you created {#clear-out-backup}

Delete the resources you no longer need to avoid paying for them:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Manually {#manual}

    * [Delete the {{ mpg-full-name }} cluster](../../managed-postgresql/operations/cluster-delete.md).
    * If you created an intermediate virtual machine, [delete it](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md).
    * If you reserved public static IP addresses, release and [delete them](../../vpc/operations/address-delete.md).

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

    1. In the terminal window, go to the directory containing the infrastructure plan.
    1. Delete the `data-restore-pgsql-mpg.tf` configuration file.
    1. Make sure the {{ TF }} configuration files are correct using this command:

        ```bash
        terraform validate
        ```

        If there are any errors in the configuration files, {{ TF }} will point them out.

    1. Confirm updating the resources.

        {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

        All the resources described in the `data-restore-pgsql-mpg.tf` configuration file will be deleted.

{% endlist %}
