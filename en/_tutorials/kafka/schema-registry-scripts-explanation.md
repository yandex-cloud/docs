The above scripts send and receive `messages` in the messages topic as a `key:meaning` pair. In the example, data format schemas are described in [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) format.

{% note info %}

Python scripts are provided for demonstration. You can prepare and send data format schemas and the data itself by creating a similar script in another language.
