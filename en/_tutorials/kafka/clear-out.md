Delete the resources you no longer need to avoid being charged for them:

* [Delete the {{ mkf-name }} cluster](../../managed-kafka/operations/cluster-delete.md).
* [Delete the virtual machine](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md).
* If you reserved public static IP addresses, release and [delete them](../../vpc/operations/address-delete.md).
