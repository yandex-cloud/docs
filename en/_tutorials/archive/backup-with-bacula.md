# Backup to {{ objstorage-full-name }} via Bacula

You can use {{ objstorage-full-name }} for VM backup and recovery via the [Bacula](https://www.bacula.org/) utility.

Bacula consists of several components:
* **Bacula Director**: Controls the backup and recovery process.
* **File Daemon**: Provides access to backup files.
* **Storage Daemon**: Reads and writes files to the hard disk.
* **Catalog**: Maintains the file catalog used for backup. The catalog is stored in a [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/documentation/) database.
* **Bacula Console**: A management console for interacting with Bacula Director.

To set up backup and recovery via Bacula:
1. [Prepare your cloud](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create a VM](#create-vm).
1. [Set up the AWS CLI](#configure-aws).
1. [Install Bacula and additional components](#install-bacula).
1. [Configure MariaDB](#configure-db).
1. [Set up a storage](#configure-storage).
1. [Configure Bacula components](#configure-bacula).
1. [Create a backup](#run-backup).
1. [Recover the files](#run-restore).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}


### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost for backup and recovery includes:

* Fee for VM computing resources (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for data storage in a bucket and operations with data (see [{{ objstorage-full-name }} pricing](../../storage/pricing.md)).
* Fee for using a dynamic or static public IP (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).


### Create a bucket {#create-bucket}

To create a bucket for backups in {{ objstorage-name }}:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and select the folder where you will perform the operations.
   1. On the folder page, click **Create resource** and select **Bucket**.
   1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the bucket.
   1. In the **Bucket access** field, select **Restricted**.
   1. In the **Storage class** field, select **Cold**.
   1. Click **Create bucket**.

{% endlist %}

### Create a service account {#create-service-account}

[Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) a service account and [assign](../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md) it the `editor` [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md).

### Create static access keys {#create-access-key}

[Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md) static access keys.

Make sure to immediately save the ID `key_id` and secret key `secret`. You will not be able to get the key value again.

## Create a VM {#create-vm}

To create a VM:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.
   1. In the **Name** field, enter the VM name `bacula-vm`.
   1. Select an [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to place the VM in.
   1. Under **Image/boot disk selection**, go to the **{{ marketplace-name }}** tab and select a public [CentOS 7](/marketplace/products/yc/centos-7) image.
   1. Under **Computing resources**, select:
      * **Platform**: Intel Cascade Lake.
      * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 20%.
      * **vCPU**: 2.
      * **RAM**: 2 GB.
   1. Under **Network settings**, select the network and subnet to connect the VM to. If there are no networks available, create one:
      1. Select ![image](../../_assets/plus-sign.svg) **Create network**.
      1. In the window that opens, enter the network name and specify the folder to host the network.
      1. (optional) To automatically create subnets, select the **Create subnets** option.
      1. Click **Create**.

         Each network must have at least one [subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet). If there is no subnet available, create one by selecting ![image](../../_assets/plus-sign.svg)**Add subnet**.
   1. Under **Public address**, keep **Auto** to assign your VM a random external IP address from the {{ yandex-cloud }} pool, or select a static address from the list if you reserved one in advance.
   1. Enter the VM access information:
      * Enter the username in the **Login** field.
      * In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the public key file.

         You will need to create a key pair for the SSH connection yourself, see [{#T}](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys).
   1. Click **Create VM**.
   1. Wait for the VM to change to the `RUNNING` status.

{% endlist %}

## Set up the AWS CLI {#configure-aws}

To set up the AWS CLI utility on your `bacula-vm` instance:

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the VM page and find out its public IP address.
1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM via SSH.

   The recommended authentication method when connecting over SSH is using a key pair. Set up the generated key pair: the private key must match the public key sent to the VM.
1. Update the packages installed in the system. For this, in the terminal, run:

   ```bash
   yum update -y
   ```

1. Install the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   yum install awscli -y
   ```

1. Set up the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   sudo aws configure
   ```

   Specify the parameter values:
   * `AWS Access Key ID`: The `key_id` that you received when [generating the static key](#create-access-key).
   * `AWS Secret Access Key`: The `secret` key that you received when [generating the static key](#create-access-key).
   * `Default region name`: `{{ region-id }}`.
   * `Default output format`: `json`.
1. Make sure that the `/root/.aws/credentials` file contains relevant values for `key_id` and `secret`:

   ```bash
   sudo cat /root/.aws/credentials
   ```

1. Make sure that the `/root/.aws/config` file contains relevant values for `Default region name` and `Default output format`:

   ```bash
   sudo cat /root/.aws/config
   ```

   *+ 3           /usr/lib64/libbaccats-postgresql.so

   Enter to keep the current selection[+], or type selection number: 1
   ```

## Set up the storage {#configure-storage}

### Prepare a backup folder {#prepare-folder}

1. Create the `/tmp/bacula` backup folder:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /tmp/bacula
   ```

1. Set up access rights for the `/tmp/bacula` folder:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R bacula:bacula /tmp/bacula
   sudo chmod -R 700 /tmp/bacula
   sudo semanage permissive -a bacula_t
   ```

### Mount the bucket to the file system {#mount-bucket}

1. Use the `s3fs` utility to mount the bucket to upload backups to {{ objstorage-name }}. To do this, run the command below and specify the bucket name:

   ```bash
   sudo s3fs <bucket_name> /tmp/bacula \
     -o url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
     -o use_path_request_style \
     -o allow_other \
     -o nonempty \
     -o uid=133,gid=133,mp_umask=077
   ```

   Where:
   * `uid=133`: The ID of the `bacula` user from the `/etc/passwd` file.
   * `gid=133`: The ID of the `bacula` group from the `/etc/passwd` file.

1. Check the access rights for the `/tmp/bacula` folder:

   ```bash
   sudo ls -la /tmp/bacula/
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   drwx------.  2 bacula bacula        31 Sep 18 09:16 .
   drwxrwxrwt. 10 root   root         265 Sep 18 08:59 ..
   ```

1. Check that the `bacula` user can create files in the `/tmp/bacula` folder:
   1. Temporarily enable the `bash` shell for the `bacula` user:

      ```bash
      sudo sed -i "/^bacula/ s@/sbin/nologin@/bin/bash@" /etc/passwd
      ```

   1. Create an arbitrary file in the `/tmp/bacula` folder:

      ```bash
      sudo runuser -l  bacula -c 'touch /tmp/bacula/test.test'
      ```

   1. Make sure that the file `test.test` was created in the `/tmp/bacula` folder:

      ```bash
      sudo ls -la /tmp/bacula | grep test.test
      ```

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), on the folder page, select **{{ objstorage-short-name }}** and make sure the `test.test` file is in the bucket.
   1. Delete the test file:

      ```bash
      sudo runuser -l  bacula -c 'rm -f /tmp/bacula/test.test'
      ```

   1. Disable the `bash` shell for the `bacula` user:

      ```bash
      sudo sed -i "/^bacula/ s@/bin/bash@/sbin/nologin@" /etc/passwd
      ```

## Configure Bacula components {#configure-bacula}

### Configure Bacula Director {#configure-director}

1. Open the Bacula Director configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
   ```

1. To set up a connection to Bacula Director, go to the `Director` configuration section and add the line `DirAddress = 127.0.0.1`:

   ```text
   ...
   Director {                              # define myself
     Name = bacula-dir
     DIRport = 9101                        # Specify the port (a positive integer) on which the Director daemon will listen for Bacula Console connections.
                                           # This same port number must be specified in the Director resource of the Console configuration file.
                                           # The default is 9101, so normally this directive need not be specified.
                                           # This directive should not be used if you specify the DirAddresses (plural) directive.
     QueryFile = "/etc/bacula/query.sql"
     WorkingDirectory = "/var/spool/bacula"
     PidDirectory = "/var/run"
     Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
     Password = "@@DIR_PASSWORD@@"         # Console password
     Messages = Daemon
     DirAddress = 127.0.0.1
   }    
   ...
   ```

1. For your convenience, rename the task `BackupClient1` to `BackupFiles`:

   ```text
   ...
   Job {
     Name = "BackupFiles"
     JobDefs = "DefaultJob"
   }
   ...
   ```

1. To assign `/tmp/bacula-restores` as a folder for your recovered files, add the line `Where = /tmp/bacula-restores` to the `RestoreFiles` job configuration:

   ```text
   ...
   Job {
     Name = "RestoreFiles"
     Type = Restore
     Client=bacula-fd
     FileSet="Full Set"
     Storage = File
     Pool = Default
     Messages = Standard
     Where = /tmp/bacula-restores
   }
   ...
   ```

1. Under the `FileSet` configuration section named `Full Set` under `Include`:
   * Add the `compression = GZIP` line to the `Options` section to enable compression during backup.
   * Specify `File = /` to back up the entire file system.

   ```text
   ...
   	FileSet {
   	  Name = "Full Set"
   	  Include {
   		Options {
   		  signature = MD5
   		  compression = GZIP
   		}
   		File = /
   	  }
   	  Exclude {
   		File = /var/spool/bacula
   		File = /tmp
   		File = /proc
   		File = /tmp
   		File = /.journal
   		File = /.fsck
   	  }
   	}
   ...
   ```

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the VM page and find out its private IP address.
1. To set up an outbound connection to the Storage Daemon, in the `Storage` configuration section, enter the VM's internal IP address in the `Address` field:

   ```text
   ...
   Storage {
     Name = File
   # Do not use "localhost" here
     Address = <internal_IP_address_of_the_VM>  # N.B. Use a fully qualified name here
     SDPort = 9103
     Password = "@@SD_PASSWORD@@"
     Device = FileStorage
     Media Type = File
   }
   ...
   ```

1. To connect to the DB, in the `Catalog` configuration section, specify the database password `dbpassword = "bacula_db_password"` that you created when [setting up MariaDB](#configure-db):

   ```text
   ...
   # Generic catalog service
   Catalog {
     Name = MyCatalog
   # Uncomment the following line if you want the dbi driver
   # dbdriver = "dbi:postgresql"; dbaddress = 127.0.0.1; dbport =
     dbname = "bacula"; dbuser = "bacula"; dbpassword = "bacula_db_password"
   }
   ...
   ```

1. Save the file.
1. Check that the `bacula-dir.conf` file contains no syntax errors:

   ```bash
   sudo bacula-dir -tc /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
   ```

   If there aren't any error messages, the configuration is correct.

### Configure Storage Daemon {#configure-storage-daemon}

1. Open the Storage Daemon configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf
   ```

1. To set up an outbound connection to the Storage Daemon, in the `Storage` configuration section, enter the VM's internal IP address in the `SDAddress` field:

   ```text
   ...
   Storage {                                      # definition of myself
     Name = BackupServer-sd
     SDPort = 9103                                # Specifies port number on which the Storage daemon listens for Director connections. The default is 9103.
     WorkingDirectory = "/var/spool/bacula"
     Pid Directory = "/var/run/bacula"
     Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20
     SDAddress = <internal_IP_address_of_the_VM>         # This directive is optional, and if it is specified,
                                                  # it will cause the Storage daemon server (for Director and File daemon connections) to bind to the specified IP-Address,
                                                  # which is either a domain name or an IP address specified as a dotted quadruple.
                                                  # If this directive is not specified, the Storage daemon will bind to any available address (the default).
   }
   ...
   ```

1. In the `Device` configuration block, specify the `Archive Device = /tmp/bacula` folder for backups:

   ```text
   ...
   Device {
     Name = FileStorage
     Media Type = File
     Archive Device = /tmp/bacula
     LabelMedia = yes;                   # lets Bacula label unlabeled media
     Random Access = Yes;
     AutomaticMount = yes;               # when device opened, read it
     RemovableMedia = no;
     AlwaysOpen = no;
   }
   ...
   ```

1. Save the file.
1. Check that the `bacula-sd.conf` file doesn't contain any syntax errors:

   ```bash
   sudo bacula-sd -tc /etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf
   ```

   If there aren't any error messages, the configuration is correct.

### Create passwords for Bacula components {#create-bacula-passwords}

Bacula Director, Storage Daemon, and File Daemon use passwords for inter-component authentication.

To set passwords for Bacula components:
1. Generate passwords for Bacula Director, Storage Daemon, and File Daemon:

   ```bash
   DIR_PASSWORD=`date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 33`
   SD_PASSWORD=`date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 33`
   FD_PASSWORD=`date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 33`
   ```

1. Put the passwords in the configuration files:

   ```bash
   sudo sed -i "s/@@DIR_PASSWORD@@/${DIR_PASSWORD}/" /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
   sudo sed -i "s/@@DIR_PASSWORD@@/${DIR_PASSWORD}/" /etc/bacula/bconsole.conf
   sudo sed -i "s/@@SD_PASSWORD@@/${SD_PASSWORD}/" /etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf
   sudo sed -i "s/@@SD_PASSWORD@@/${SD_PASSWORD}/" /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf
   sudo sed -i "s/@@FD_PASSWORD@@/${FD_PASSWORD}/" /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf

   ```

1. Check the recovery status:

   ```bash
   status director
   ```

   Here's the result if the recovery is in progress:

   ```text
   Running Jobs:
   Console connected at 12-Sep-19 07:25
    JobId Level   Name                       Status
   ======================================================================
        3         RestoreFiles.2019-09-12_07.27.42_05 is running
   ```

   Here's the result if the recovery is complete:

   ```text
   Terminated Jobs:
    JobId  Level    Files      Bytes   Status   Finished        Name
   ====================================================================

   ```

1. Wait for the recovery to complete and exit Bacula Console:

   ```bash
   exit
   ```

### Check the recovered files {#check-restore}

1. Make sure that the `/tmp/bacula-restores` folder now contains the recovered data:

   ```bash
   sudo ls -la /tmp/bacula-restores
   ```

   Result:

   ```text

   ```

1. Make sure that the `ping` utility is in the `/tmp/bacula-restores` folder:

   ```bash
   sudo ls -la /tmp/bacula-restores/bin/ping
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 66176 Aug  4  2017 /tmp/bacula-restores/bin/ping
   ```

1. Copy the `ping` utility to the main file system:

   ```bash
   sudo cp /tmp/bacula-restores/bin/ping /bin/ping
   ```

1. Make sure that `ping` works:

   ```bash
   sudo ping 127.0.0.1 -c 1
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.016 ms

   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.016/0.016/0.016/0.000 ms
   ```

1. To free up disk space, delete the copy of the recovered files:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rfd /tmp/bacula-restores/*
   ```

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}
