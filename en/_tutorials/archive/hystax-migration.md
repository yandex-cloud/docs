# Migrating to {{ yandex-cloud }} using Hystax Acura

You can use Hystax Acura to migrate your cloud infrastructure to {{ yandex-cloud }} from another cloud platform. To do so, you will need to create a VM with Hystax Acura in your cloud. This VM will be used to manage the migration setup and run, while the migration process itself will be performed by a service VM with Hystax Acura Cloud Agent. This service VM will migrate your VMs to your cloud. Before VM migration starts, VM replicas are created. Those replicas will be used for infrastructure deployment during migration.

To migrate VMs:
1. [Prepare your cloud](#before-begin).
1. [Create a service account and authorized key](#create-sa).
1. [Configure network traffic permissions](#network-settings).
1. [Create a VM with Hystax Acura](#create-acura-vm).
1. [Set up Hystax Acura](#setup-hystax-acura).
1. [Set up Hystax Acura Cloud Agent](#prepare-agent).
1. [Create VM replicas](#create-replicas).
1. [Create a migration plan](#prepare-migration-plan).
1. [Start migration](#start-migration).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Prepare your cloud {#before-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

{% note info %}

Please note that the infrastructure for Hystax Acura and Hystax Acura Cloud Agent and all migrated VMs will consume your [quotas]({{ link-console-quotas }}) and you will have to pay for them.
* A Hystax Acura VM uses 8 vCPUs, 16 GB of RAM, and a 200-GB disk.
* A Hystax Acura Cloud Agent VM uses 2 vCPUs, 4 GB of RAM, and an 8-GB disk.

{% endnote %}

The cost of the resources required to use Hystax Acura Live Migration includes:
* Charge for the disks and continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* Charges for object storage (see [{{ compute-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a dynamic or a static public IP (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).
* A charge for each completed migration (see [product description](/marketplace/products/hystax/hystax-acura-live-cloud-migration) in {{ marketplace-name }}).

## Create a service account and authorized key {#create-sa}

Hystax Acura Live Migration will run under a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md):
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) the `hystax-acura-account` service account with the `editor` and the `marketplace.meteringAgent` roles.
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/authorized-key/create.md) an authorized key for the service account.

Save the following details to use in subsequent steps:
1. Service account ID.
1. Service account authorized key ID.
1. Service account private authorized key.

## Configure network traffic permissions {#network-settings}

Configure network traffic permissions in the [default security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md#default-security-group). If a security group is unavailable, any incoming or outgoing VM traffic will be allowed.

If a security group is available, [add](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) the rules below to it:

| Traffic<br>direction | Description | Port<br>range | Protocol | Source<br>type | Source/Purpose |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| Incoming | http | 80 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | https | 443 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | https | 4443 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | vmware | 902 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | vmware | 902 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | iSCSI | 3260 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | udp | 12201 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | TCP | 15000 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | http | 80 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | https | 443 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | vmware | 902 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | vmware | 902 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | iSCSI | 3260 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | udp | 12201 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |

Save the security group ID. You will need it when creating VMs with Hystax Acura.

         * **DKMS**: Compile as you install.
      1. Click **Next**.
      1. You will get commands for installing the agent to the VM. Run these commands following the instructions for your distribution and installation method.

   {% endlist %}

The VM will show up in the target group a few minutes after the agent is installed.

## Create VM replicas {#create-replicas}

{% note alert %}

When replication starts, Hystax Acura creates a new VM with Hystax Acura Cloud Agent in the cloud to run all operations in your cloud.

{% endnote %}

Start replication:
1. Click the Hystax logo.
1. Under **Machines Groups**, select the virtual machines to replicate.
1. You can specify additional parameters for the `network-ssd` volume in the replication editing menu.
1. Click **Bulk actions**. In the menu that opens, select **Start Replication**.

A VM replica will include all the data of the original VM; therefore, replication can take a long time (about 40 minutes). The replication status will be displayed in the **Status** column under **Machines Groups**. Wait for the status to change to `Synced` and make sure the replicas of the selected machines show up in your folder in the {{ compute-name }} VM list.

## Create a migration plan {#prepare-migration-plan}

As soon as the replication status of the VMs is `Synced`, you can create a migration plan. The migration plan defines which machines should be migrated to your cloud and their start order after migration.
1. Click **Add Migration plan**.
1. Enter a name for the migration plan, e.g., `YC Migration`.
1. Under **Devices & Ranks**, click ![options](../../_assets/options.svg). In the menu that opens, click **Add machine**, pick the VM group you need, and select the VM you want to add to the migration plan. Repeat the steps for all VMs to migrate.
1. In the **Subnet ID** and the **CIDR** fields, specify the ID and the CIDR of the subnet to connect the VMs to once migrated.
1. Expand the device description and edit the **Flavor name** field (parameters of the VM being created) as follows: `<platform>-<cpu>-<ram>-<core_fraction>`. For example, `2-8-16-100`.
1. In the **Port ip** field, enter a new VM IP from the current subnet.
1. Click **Save**.

## Start migration {#start-migration}

Perform the migration as per the created plan:
1. Open the **Migrate** tab.
1. Select the `YC Migration` plan and click **Next**.
1. Enter `CloudSite` in the **Cloud Site Name** field.
1. Make sure all required resources are in the list and click **Run migration**.

The migration process might take about 10 minutes. The status of the VM being migrated will be displayed in the **Status** column under **Machines**. Wait for the status to change to `Running`, then make sure all required resources have been transferred and your applications are ready to run. If the migrated infrastructure is running as expected, click **Detach** on the **CloudSite** page and confirm the detach action.

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the migration infrastructure:
1. [Delete](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md) the `hystax-acura-vm` VM.
1. [Delete](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md) the supplemental `cloud-agent` VMs.
1. [Delete](../../iam/operations/sa/delete.md) the `hystax-acura-account` service account.

If you reserved a public static IP address, [delete it](../../vpc/operations/address-delete.md).
