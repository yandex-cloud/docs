# Recognizing text in image archives in {{ vision-full-name }}

Use the [{{ vision-full-name }}](../../vision/) service to recognize text in images. You can also store both the source images and recognition results in [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../../storage/).

To set up an infrastructure for text recognition using {{ vision-name }} and export the results automatically to {{ objstorage-name }}:
1. [Before you start](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create a bucket](#create-bucket).
1. [Create a VM](#create-vm).
1. [Configure the VM](#configure-vm).
1. [Create an archive with images](#create-archive).
1. [Prepare a script for recognition and uploading of images](#prepare-script).
1. [Double-check the recognition results](#check-result).

If you no longer need these resources, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The infrastructure costs for image recognition and data storage include:
* A fee for VM computing resources (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for data storage in a bucket and operations with data (see [{{ objstorage-full-name }} pricing](../../storage/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a dynamic or a static public IP (see [pricing{{ vpc-full-name }}](../../vpc/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using {{ vision-full-name }} (see [pricing for {{ vision-full-name }}](../../vision/pricing.md)).

{% endif %}

## Create a bucket {#create-bucket}

To create an {{ objstorage-name }} [bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) to store the source images and recognition results:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and select the folder where you will perform the operations.
   1. On the folder page, click **Create resource** and select **Bucket**.
   1. In the **Name** field, enter the bucket name following the [naming conventions](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md#naming), such as `vision-bucket`.
   1. In the **Bucket access** field, select **Restricted**.
   1. In the **Storage class** field, select **Cold**.
   1. Click **Create bucket**.

{% endlist %}

## Create a VM {#create-vm}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.
   1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the VM, such as `vision-vm`. Naming requirements:

      {% include [name-format](../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

   1. Select an [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to place the VM in.
   1. Under **Image/boot disk selection**, go to the **{{ marketplace-name }}** tab and select a public [CentOS 7](/marketplace/products/yc/centos-7) image.
   1. Under **Disks and file storages**, select the parameters:

   1. ClickÂ **Create VM**.
   1. Wait for the VM status to change to `Running` and save its public IP address: you'll need it for SSH connection.

{% endlist %}

## Configure the VM {#configure-vm}

### Set up the {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI {#configure-yc-cli}

1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to the VM via SSH.
1. [Install](../../cli/quickstart.md#install) the {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI and [create](../../cli/quickstart.md#initialize) a profile.
1. Make sure that the {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI runs correctly:

   {% list tabs %}

   - CLI

      Run the following command on the VM:

      ```bash
      yc config list
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      token: AQ...gs
      cloud-id: b1gdtdqb1900f5rqqvli
      folder-id: b1gveg9vude9g3uioa50
      ```

      Save the `folder-id` parameter: you'll need it to set up a service account.

   {% endlist %}

### Set up a service account {#configure-sa}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   1. Create a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md):

      ```bash
      yc iam service-account create \
        --name <service_account_name> \
        --description "<service_account_description>"
      ```

      Where:
      * `--name` is the service account name, such as `vision-sa`.
      * `--description` is a description of the service account, for example, `this is the vision service account`.

      Result:

      ```text
      id: aje6aoc8hccuh5tp55bg
      folder_id: b1gv87ssvu497lpgjh5o
      created_at: "2022-10-12T14:04:43.198559512Z"
      name: vision-sa
      description: this is vision service account
      ```

      Save the `id` parameter: this is the service account ID you'll need in the setup process.

   1. Assign the `editor` [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#editor) to the service account.

      ```bash
      yc resource-manager folder add-access-binding <folder_id> \
        --role editor \
        --subject serviceAccount:<service_account_ID>
      ```

      Where:
      * `--role`: The role assigned.
      * `--subject serviceAccount`: Service account ID.

   1. Create a [static access key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/access-key.md) for the service account.

      ```bash
      yc iam access-key create \
        --service-account-id <service_account_ID> \
        --description "<key_description>"
      ```

      Where:
      * `--service-account-id`: Service account ID.
      * `--description`: A description for the key, for example, `this key is for vision`.

      Result:

      ```yaml
      access_key:
        id: ajen8d7fur27bt8losom
        service_account_id: aje6aoc8hccuh5tp55bg
        created_at: "2022-10-12T15:08:08.045280520Z"
        description: this key is for vision
        key_id: YC...li
      secret: YC...J5
      ```

      Save the following parameters (you'll need them to set up the AWS CLI utility):
      * `key_id`: The ID of the static access key.
      * `secret`: The secret key.

   1. Create an [authorized key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/key.md) for a service account:

      ```bash
      yc iam key create \
        --service-account-id <service_account_ID> \
        --output key.json
      ```

      Where:
      * `--service-account-id`: Service account ID.
      * `--output`: The name of JSON file with an authorized key.

      Result:

      ```yaml
      id: aje3qc9pagb9kedkhdn5
      service_account_id: aje6aoc8hccuh5tp55bg
      created_at: "2022-10-13T12:53:04.810240976Z"
      key_algorithm: RSA_2048
      ```

   1. Create a {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI profile to run on behalf of the service account, such as `vision-profile`:

      ```bash
      yc config profile create vision-profile
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      Profile 'vision-profile' created and activated
      ```

   1. Specify the authorized key of the service account in the profile configuration:

      ```bash
      yc config set service-account-key key.json
      ```

   1. Get an [IAM token](../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md) for the service account:

      ```bash
      yc iam create-token
      ```

      Save the IAM token, you'll need it to send images to {{ vision-name }}.

{% endlist %}

### Set up the AWS CLI {#configure-aws-cli}

1. Update the packages installed in the VM operating system. To do this, run the command:

   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   ```

1. Install the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install awscli -y
   ```

1. Set up the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   Specify the parameter values:
   * `AWS Access Key ID`: The ID of the `key_id` static access key that you generated when [setting up the service account](#configure-sa).
   * `AWS Secret Access Key`: The `secret` key that you generated when [setting up the service account](#configure-sa).
   * `Default region name`: `{{ region-id }}`.
   * `Default output format`: `json`.

1. Make sure that the `~/.aws/credentials` file contains relevant values for `key_id` and `secret`:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.aws/credentials
   ```

1. Make sure that the `~/.aws/config` file contains relevant values for `Default region name` and `Default output format`:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.aws/config
   ```

## Create an archive with images {#create-archive}

1. [Upload](../../storage/operations/objects/upload.md) your images that include recognizable text to the bucket.

   {% note tip %}

   Use the [sample image](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/vision/penguins_sample.jpg) of the penguin crossing road sign.

   {% endnote %}

1. To make sure that the images were uploaded, use the request with the bucket name:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} s3 ls s3://<bucket_name>/
   ```

1. Save the images from the bucket to the VM, for example, to the `my_pictures` folder:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} s3 cp s3://<bucket_name>/ my_pictures --recursive
   ```

1. Compress the images into an archive, for example, `my_pictures.tar`:

   ```bash
   tar -cf my_pictures.tar my_pictures/*
   ```

1. Delete the image directory:

   ```bash
   rm -rfd my_pictures
   ```

## Prepare a script for digitizing and uploading images {#prepare-script}

### Configure the environment {#prepare-environment}

1. Install the `jq` package. The script will use it to process the results from {{ vision-name }}:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install jq -y
   ```

1. Install the text editor `nano`:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install nano -y
   ```

1. Set the environment variables necessary for the script to run:

   ```bash
   export BUCKETNAME="<bucket_name>"
   export FOLDERID="<folder_id>"
   export IAMTOKEN="<IAM_token>"
   ```

   Where:
   * `BUCKETNAME`: The bucket name.
   * `FOLDERID`: The folder ID.
   * `IAMTOKEN`: The IAM token that you issued when [setting up the service account](#configure-sa).

### Create a script {#create-script}

The script includes the following steps:
1. Create the relevant directories.
1. Unpack the archive with images.
1. Process all the images one-by-one:
   1. Base64-encode the image.
   1. Create a request body for the given image.
   1. Send the image in a POST request to {{ vision-name }} for recognition.
   1. Save the result to the `output.json` file.
   1. Extract the recognized text from `output.json` and save it to a text file.
1. Add the resulting text files to an archive.
1. Upload the archive with the text files to {{ objstorage-name }}.
1. Delete the auxiliary files.

For your convenience, the text of the script includes comments to each step.

To implement the script:
1. Create a file, for example, `vision.sh` and open it in the `nano` text editor:

   ```bash
   sudo nano vision.sh
   ```

1. Copy the script text to `vision.sh`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Create the relevant directories
    echo "Creating directories..."

   # Create a directory for the recognized text
   mkdir my_pictures_text

   # Unpack the archive with images to the created directory
   echo "Extract pictures in my_pictures directory..."
   tar -xf my_pictures.tar

   # Recognize the images from the archive
   FILES=my_pictures/*
   for f in $FILES
   # Loop through the files in the directory to run the actions:
   do
       # Base64-encode the image to send it to {{ vision-name }}
       CODEIMG=$(base64 -i $f | cat)

       # Create the body.json file to be sent in a POST request to {{ vision-name }}
       cat <<EOF > body.json
   {
   "folderId": "$FOLDERID",
   "analyze_specs": [{
   "content": "$CODEIMG",
   "features": [{
   "type": "TEXT_DETECTION",
   "text_detection_config": {
   "language_codes": ["en","ru"]
   }
   }]
   }]
   }
   EOF
       # Send the image to {{ vision-name }} for recognition and write the result to output.json
       echo "Processing file $f in {{ vision-name }}..."
       curl -X POST --silent \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${IAMTOKEN}" \
       -d '@body.json' \
       https://vision.{{ api-host }}/vision/v1/batchAnalyze > output.json

       # Get the image file name to be used below
       IMAGE_BASE_NAME=$(basename -- "$f")
       IMAGE_NAME="${IMAGE_BASE_NAME%.*}"

       # Get text data from output.json and write it to a TXT file named identically with the image file
       cat output.json | jq -r '.results[].results[].textDetection.pages[].blocks[].lines[].words[].text' | awk -v ORS=" " '{print}' > my_pictures_text/$IMAGE_NAME".txt"
   done

   # Add the directory with the text files to an archive
   echo "Packing text files to archive..."
   tar -cf my_pictures_text.tar my_pictures_text

   # Send the text file archive to the bucket
   echo "Sending archive to Object Storage Bucket..."
   aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} s3 cp my_pictures_text.tar s3://$BUCKETNAME/ > /dev/null

   # Delete the auxiliary files
   echo "Cleaning up..."
   rm -f body.json
   rm -f output.json
   rm -rfd my_pictures
   rm -rfd my_pictures_text
   rm -r my_pictures_text.tar
   ```

1. Set the permissions to run the script:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 755 vision.sh
   ```

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./vision.sh
   ```

## Double-check the recognition results {#check-result}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the bucket with the recognition results is located.
   1. Select **{{ objstorage-short-name }}**.
   1. Open the bucket with the recognition results.
   1. Make sure that the bucket contains the `my_pictures_text.tar` archive.
   1. Download and unpack the archive.
   1. Make sure that the text in the `<image name>.txt` file matches the text in the image.

{% endlist %}
