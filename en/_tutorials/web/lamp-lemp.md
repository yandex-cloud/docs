# Website on a LAMP or LEMP stack

[LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) ([Linux](https://www.linux.org/), [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [PHP](https://www.php.net/)) and its variant LEMP (which uses [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) instead of Apache as its web server) are popular component bundles for web apps and dynamic website deployment.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy LAMP in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure: as a result, you'll launch a VM running your site's web server.

To set up a LAMP or LEMP-based website:

1. [Before you start](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create a VM with a pre-installed web server](#create-vm).
1. [Upload the website files](#upload-files).
1. [Configure DNS](#configure-dns).
1. [Check that the website is running](#test-site).

If you no longer need the website, [delete all its resources](#clear-out).

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}



### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost for maintaining a LAMP server includes:

* A fee for a continuously running VM (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a dynamic or static external IP address (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).


## Create a VM with a pre-installed web server {#create-vm}

1. On the folder page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource**, and select **Virtual machine**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the VM: `lamp-vm` or `lemp-vm`.

    {% include [name-format](../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

1. Select the [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to host the VM in. If you don't know which availability zone you need, leave the default.

1. Under **Image/boot disk selection**, click the **{{ marketplace-name }}** tab, and select the VM image with the desired set of components:
   * [LAMP](/marketplace/products/yc/lamp) for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
   * [LEMP](/marketplace/products/yc/lemp) for Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP.

     For static websites, we recommend using LEMP.

1. Under **Computing resources**:
   * Choose a [platform](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md) for your VM.
   * Specify the necessary number of vCPUs and amount of RAM.

   The minimum configuration is enough for functional website testing:
   * **Platform**: Intel Ice Lake.
   * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 20%.
   * **vCPU**: 2.
   * **RAM**: 1 GB.

1. In the **Network settings** section, select the network and subnet to connect the VM to. If you don't have a network or subnet, create them right on the VM creation page.

1. In the **Public address** field, leave the **Auto** value to assign a random external IP address from the {{ yandex-cloud }} pool, or select a static address from the list if you reserved one in advance.

1. Specify data required for accessing the VM:

   * Enter the username in the **Login** field.

   * In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the public key file.

      You need to create a key pair for the SSH connection yourself. Learn [how to connect to VMs via SSH](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md).

    {% note alert %}

     The IP address and host name (FQDN) to connect to the VM are assigned on VM creation. If you selected **No address** in the **Public address** field, you won't be able to access the VM from the internet.

    {% endnote %}

1. Click **Create VM**.

   Creating the VM may take several minutes. When the VM status changes to `RUNNING`, you can [upload the website files to it](#upload-files).

## Upload the website files {#upload-files}

To test the web server, upload the `index.html` file to the VM. You can use a [test file](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/doc-files/index.html.zip). Make sure you unzip the archive.

{% include [upload-files](../_tutorials_includes/upload-web-site-files.md) %}

## Configure DNS (if you have a domain name) {#configure-dns}

If you have a registered domain name, use the Cloud DNS service to manage the domain.

{% include [configure-a-record-and-cname](configure-a-record-and-cname.md) %}

## Check that the website is running {#test-site}

To check that the site is up, enter its IP address or domain name in your browser:

* `http://<virtual machine public IP address>`.
* `http://www.example.com`.

## How to delete created resources {#clear-out}

To stop paying for your deployed server, just [delete](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md) the `lamp-vm` or `lemp-vm` virtual machine.

If you reserved a static public IP address specifically for this VM:

1. Open the **{{ vpc-name }}** in your folder.
1. Go to the **IP addresses** tab.
1. Find the address you need, click ![ellipsis](../../_assets/options.svg), and select **Delete**.
