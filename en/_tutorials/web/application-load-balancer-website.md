# Fault-tolerant website with load balancing by {{ alb-full-name }}

Create and set up a website with load balancing by [{{ alb-name }}](../../application-load-balancer/concepts/index.md) between three availability zones and fault tolerance in one zone.

1. [Prepare your cloud](#before-you-begin).
1. [Prepare the network infrastructure](#prepare-network).
1. [Create security groups](#create-security-groups).
1. [Create an instance group](#create-vms).
1. [Upload the website files](#upload-files).
1. [Create a backend group](#create-backend-group).
1. [Create an HTTP router](#create-http-routers-sites).
1. [Create an L7 load balancer](#create-alb).
1. [Configure the DNS](#configure-dns).
1. [Test the fault tolerance](#test-ha).

If you no longer need the website, [delete all its resources](#clear-out).

You can also deploy the infrastructure for hosting a website via {{ TF }} using a [ready-made configuration file](#terraform).

## Prepare your cloud {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}


### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The infrastructure support cost includes:

* Fee for continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* Fee for using a dynamic external IP address (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).
* Fee for load balancing (see [{{ alb-full-name }} pricing](../../application-load-balancer/pricing.md)).


## Prepare the network infrastructure {#prepare-network}

Before creating a VM:

1. Go to the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and select the folder where you will perform the operations.

1. Make sure that the selected folder contains a network with subnets in the `{{ region-id }}-a`, `{{ region-id }}-b`, and `{{ region-id }}-с` availability zones. To do this, select **{{ vpc-name }}** on the folder page. If the [subnets](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) or [network](../../vpc/operations/network-create.md) you need are not listed, create them.

## Create security groups {#create-security-groups}

{% note info %}

{% include [security-groups-note](../../_includes/vpc/security-groups-note-services.md) %}

{% endnote %}

[Security groups](../../application-load-balancer/concepts/application-load-balancer.md#security-groups) include rules that let the load balancer receive incoming traffic and redirect it to the VMs so they can receive the traffic.

To create security groups for the load balancer and an instance group:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select **{{ vpc-name }}**.
   1. Open the **Security groups** tab.
   1. Create a security group for the load balancer:
      1. Click **Create group**.
      1. Name the group, such as `alb-sg`.
      1. Select the network to assign the security group to.
      1. Under **Rules**, create the following rules using the instructions below the table:

         | Traffic<br/>direction | Description | Port<br/>range | Protocol | Source/<br/>destination type | Source /<br/>destination |
         | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
         | Outgoing | any | All | Any | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
         | Incoming | ext-http | 80 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
         | Incoming | ext-https | 443 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
         | Incoming | healthchecks | 30080 | TCP | Load balancer health checks | N/A |

         1. Select the **Outgoing traffic** or **Incoming traffic** tab.
         1. Click **Add rule**.
         1. In the **Port range** field of the window that opens, specify a single port or a range of ports that traffic will come to or from.
         1. In the **Protocol** field, specify the desired protocol or leave **Any** to allow traffic transmission over any protocol.
         1. In the **Purpose** or **Source** field, select the purpose of the rule:
            * **CIDR**: Rule will apply to the range of IP addresses. In the **CIDR blocks** field, specify the CIDR and masks of subnets that traffic will come to or from. To add multiple CIDRs, click **Add CIDR**.
            * **Security group**: Rule will apply to the VMs from the current group or the selected security group.
            * **Load balancer health checks**: Rule that allows a load balancer to check the health of VMs.
         1. Click **Save**. Repeat the steps to create all rules from the table.
      1. Click **Save**.

   1. Similarly, create a security group named `alb-vm-sg` for an instance group, with the same network and the following rules:

      | Traffic<br/>direction | Description | Port<br/>range | Protocol | Source type | Source |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | Incoming | balancer | 80 | TCP | Security group | `alb-sg` |
      | Incoming | ssh | 22 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |

## Create an instance group {#create-vms}

Your application back ends will be deployed on the VM instance of the [target group](../../application-load-balancer/concepts/target-group.md). The target group will be attached to the load balancer so that requests can be sent to the backend endpoints of your application.

To create an instance group with the minimum configuration:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select **{{ compute-name }}**.
  1. Open the **Instance groups** tab and click **Create group**.
  1. Under **Basic parameters**:
     * Name the instance group like `alb-vm-group`.
     * Select a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) from the list or create a new one. To be able to create, update, and delete group instances, assign the `editor` role to the service account.  In {{ ig-name }}, all operations are performed on behalf of a service account.
  1. Under **Allocation**, select three availability zones (`{{ region-id }}-a`, `{{ region-id }}-b` and `{{ region-id }}-с`) to ensure fault tolerance of your hosting.
  1. Under **Instance template**, click **Define** and set up the configuration for a basic instance:
     * Under **Basic parameters**, enter the template **Description**:
     * Under **Image/boot disk selection**, go to the **{{ marketplace-name }}** tab, select the [LEMP](/marketplace/products/yc/lemp) product, and click **Use**.
     * Under **Disks**, specify:
       * Disk **type**: HDD.
       * **Size**: 3 GB.
     * Under **Computing resources**, specify:
       * **Platform**: Intel Cascade Lake.
       * **vCPU**: 2.
       * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 5%
       * **RAM**: 1 GB.
     * Under **Network settings**:
       * Select a cloud network and its subnets.
       * In the **Public address** field, select **Auto**.
       * Select the `alb-vm-sg` security group.
     * Under **Access**, specify the data required to access the VM:
       * In the **Service account** field, select the service account to link the VM to.
       * Enter the username in the **Login** field.
       * In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the public key file.
            To establish an SSH connection, you need to create a key pair. For more information, see [Connecting to a Linux VM via SSH](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys).
     * Click **Save**.

  1. Under **Scaling**, enter the **Size** of the instance group: 3.
  1. Under **Integration with Application Load Balancer**, select **Create target group** and specify `alb-tg` as the group name.
  1. Click **Create**.

   See [How to create an infrastructure using {{ TF }}](#terraform).

{% endlist %}

It may take several minutes to create an instance group. Once all VMs change their status to `RUNNING`, you can [upload the website files to them](#upload-files).

#### See also

* [{#T}](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md)

## Upload the website files {#upload-files}

To test the web server, upload the website files to each VM. For example, you can use the `index.html` file from [this archive](https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/doc-files/index.html.zip).

Do the following for each VM instance in the [created group](#create-vms):

1. On the **Virtual machines** tab, click on the name of the desired VM in the list. Under **Network**, find the VM's public IP address.
1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to the VM via SSH.
1. Grant your user write access to the directory `/var/www/html`:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R "$USER":www-data /var/www/html
   ```

1. Upload the website files to the VM via [SCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol).

   {% list tabs %}

   - Linux/macOS

     Use the `scp` command-line utility:

     ```bash
     scp -r <path to the file directory> <VM username>@<VM IP address>:/var/www/html
     ```

   - Windows

     Use [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) to copy the local file directory to `/var/www/html` on the VM.

   {% endlist %}

## Create a backend group {#create-backend-group}

You must link the target group created with the VM group to the [backend group](../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md) that defines traffic allocation settings.

For the backends, groups will implement [health checks](../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md#health-checks): the load balancer will periodically send health check requests to the VMs and expect a response after a certain delay.

To create a backend group:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Select **{{ alb-name }}** in the folder where the instance group was created.

   1. Open the **Backend groups** tab.
   1. Click **Create backend group**.
   1. Name the backend group, such as `alb-bg`.
   1. Under **Backends**, click **Add**.
   1. Name the backend, such as `backend-1`.
   1. In the **Target group** field, select the previously created `alb-tg` target group.
   1. Specify the **Port** that the backend VMs will use to receive incoming traffic from the load balancer: `80`.
   1. Click **Add health check**.
   1. Enter the **Port** that the backend VMs will use to accept health check connections from the load balancer: `80`.
   1. Enter the **Path** to be accessed by the load balancer's health checks: `/`.
   1. Click **Create**.
