# Publishing game updates using {{ cdn-full-name }}

Create and configure a {{ cdn-full-name }} [CDN resource](../../cdn/concepts/resource.md) to host content that is expected to handle a large number of requests over a short period of time, such as game update files (patches, DLC, and so on). To prevent CDN servers from increasing the workload on the content origins during this period, files will be [preloaded](../../cdn/concepts/caching.md#prefetch) to the server cache once.

We assume a patch is a single file named `ycgame-update-v1.1.exe`. It will be uploaded to a {{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket.

{% note info %}

We don't recommend preloading files smaller than 200 MB or larger than 5 GB.

{% endnote %}

To create a CDN infrastructure:

1. [Get started](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create buckets in {{ objstorage-name }}](#create-buckets).
1. [Enable logging for the bucket with files](#enable-logging).
1. [Upload a file to the bucket](#upload-object).
1. [Create a CDN resource and enable caching](#create-cdn-resource).
1. [Set up DNS for your domain](#dns-setup).
1. [Preload content to the cache of CDN servers](#prefetch-content).
1. [Test the CDN](#check-cdn-working).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

Make sure you have a domain name and can access the DNS settings on the website of your DNS hosting provider. This is usually the company that registered your domain.


### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost of supporting the CDN infrastructure includes:

* A fee for outgoing traffic from CDN servers (see [{{ cdn-name }} pricing](../../cdn/pricing.md)).
* Fee for data storage in {{ objstorage-name }}, operations with data, and outgoing traffic (see [{{ objstorage-name }} pricing](../../storage/pricing.md)).
* A fee for public DNS queries and DNS zones if you use {{ dns-full-name }} (see [{{ dns-name }} pricing](../../dns/pricing.md)).


## Create buckets in {{ objstorage-name }} {#create-buckets}

Create two buckets: one will store files and the other will store request logs for the first one.

- {{ TF }}

   {% include [terraform-install](../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

   Before you start, retrieve the [static access keys](../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md): a secret key and a key ID used for authentication in {{ objstorage-short-name }}.

   1. In the configuration file, describe the bucket parameters:

      * `access_key`: ID of the static access key.
      * `secret_key`: Value of the secret access key.
      * `bucket`: The name of the bucket being created.

      Example of the configuration file structure:

      
      ```hcl
      provider "yandex" {
        token     = "<OAuth>"
        cloud_id  = "<cloud_ID>"
        folder_id = "<folder_ID>"
        zone      = "{{ region-id }}-a"
      }

      resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "storage" {
        access_key = "<static_key_ID>"
        secret_key = "<private_key>"
        bucket     = "<name_of_bucket_with_files>"
        acl        = "public-read"
      }

      resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "logs" {
        access_key = "<static_key_ID>"
        secret_key = "<private_key>"
        bucket     = "<name_of_bucket_with_logs>"
      }
      ```



1. Make sure that the configuration files are correct:

   1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
   1. Run the check using this command:

      ```bash
      terraform plan
      ```

   If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal displays the parameters of the bucket being created. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

1. Deploy the bucket:

   1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

      ```bash
      terraform apply
      ```

   1. Confirm that you want to create the bucket.

- API

   Use the API [create](../../storage/s3/api-ref/bucket/create.md) method.

{% endlist %}

## Enable logging for the bucket with files {#enable-logging}

You need to check that, when user requests are made, files are downloaded from the CDN server cache rather than directly from the bucket. To do this, enable bucket logging.

{% list tabs %}

- API

   Use the [putBucketLogging](../../storage/s3/api-ref/bucket/putBucketLogging.md) API method for the bucket with files. HTTP request body:

   ```xml
   <BucketLoggingStatus xmlns="http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01">
     <LoggingEnabled>
       <TargetBucket>name_of_bucket_with_logs</TargetBucket>
     </LoggingEnabled>
   </BucketLoggingStatus>
   ```

   Where `TargetBucket` is the name of the bucket to write logs to.

{% endlist %}

## Upload a file to the bucket {#upload-object}

{% list tabs %}

     s3://<name_of_bucket_with_files>/ycgame-update-v1.1.exe
   ```

   Result:

   ```
   upload: <path_to_ycgame-update-v1.1.exe> to s3://<name_of_bucket_with_files>/ycgame-update-v1.1.exe
   ```

- {{ TF }}

   1. Add the parameters of the object to upload to the configuration file you created in the [bucket creation step](#create-buckets):

      * `bucket`: Name of the bucket to add the object to.
      * `key`: Name of the object in the bucket (`ycgame-update-v1.1.exe`). This parameter is required.
      * `source`: Relative or absolute path to the file that you upload as an object.

      Example of the configuration file structure:

      ```hcl
      ...

      resource "yandex_storage_object" "patch-v1-1" {
        access_key = "<static_key_ID>"
        secret_key = "<private_key>"
        bucket = "<name_of_bucket_with_files>"
        key    = "ycgame-update-v1.1.exe"
        source = "<path_to_file>/ycgame-update-v1.1.exe"
      }
      ```

   1. Make sure the configuration files are valid.

      1. In the command line, go to the directory with the configuration file.
      1. Run the check using this command:

         ```bash
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal will display a list of created resources and their parameters. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Deploy cloud resources.

      1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

      ```bash
      terraform apply
      ```

      1. Confirm that you want to create the object.

   1. Make sure the configuration files are valid.

      1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run the check using this command:

         ```bash
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal will display a list of created resources and their parameters. This is a test step. No resources are created. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Apply the configuration changes:

      1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

         ```bash
         terraform apply
         ```

      1. Confirm the resource creation: type `yes` in the terminal and press **Enter**.

      All the resources you need will then be created in the specified folder. You can check that the resources are there and their settings are correct using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

   1. Enable client redirect for a resource. Add the following field at the beginning of the `options` section for a CDN resource:

      ```hcl
      ...
      options {
        redirect_https_to_http = true
      ...
      ```

   1. Run the check using this command:

      ```bash
      terraform plan
      ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal will display a list of updated resources and their parameters. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. If there are no errors, run this command:

      ```bash
      terraform apply
      ```

   1. Confirm the resource update: type `yes` in the terminal and press **Enter**.

   This enables a redirect for the resource.
