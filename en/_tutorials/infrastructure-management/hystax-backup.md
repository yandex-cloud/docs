# Creating a VM backup with Hystax Acura Backup

You can create VM backups automatically and recover them in your cloud infrastructure using [Hystax Acura Backup in {{ yandex-cloud }}](/marketplace/products/hystax/hystax-acura-backup).

A VM with Hystax Acura Backup manages backup and recovery processes. VM backups are saved to a {{ objstorage-name }} [bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md). Recovery is performed using an auxiliary Hystax Cloud Agent VM. It creates a new VM with a certain RPO (Recovery Point Objective) as of an arbitrary point of time in the past. A VM backup's RTO (Recovery Time Objective) depends on the amount of source data.

To back up and recover a VM using Hystax Acura Backup:

1. [Before you start](#before-begin).
1. [Create a service account](#create-sa).
1. [Configure network traffic permissions](#network-settings).
1. [Create a bucket](#create-bucket).
1. [Create a VM with Hystax Acura Backup](#create-acura-vm).
1. [Make the VM's IP address static](#static-ip).
1. [Set up Hystax Acura Backup](#setup-hystax-acura).
1. [Prepare and install an agent on the VM](#prepare-agent).
1. [Create a VM backup](#start-protection).
1. [Create a disaster recovery plan](#create-recovery-plan).
1. [Run the recovery process](#run-recover).

If you no longer need these resources, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Prepare your cloud {#before-begin}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

{% note info %}

Please note that the Hystax Acura Backup infrastructure and all the recovered VMs will consume your [quotas]({{ link-console-quotas }}) and you'll have to pay for them.
* A Hystax Acura Backup VM uses 8 vCPUs, 16 GB of RAM, and a 200GB disk.
* The auxiliary Hystax Cloud Agent VMs use 2 vCPU cores, 4 GB or RAM, and a 10-GB disk. A single Hystax Acura Cloud Agent VM can serve up to 6 replicated disks at the same time. If there are more than 6 disks, additional Hystax Acura Cloud Agent VMs are created automatically.

For detailed system requirements, see the [Hystax documentation](https://cdn.hystax.com/Hystax/Documentation/Deployment-requirements.pdf).

{% endnote %}

The cost of the resources required to use Hystax Acura Backup includes:
* A fee for VM computing resources (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md#prices-instance-resources)).
* A fee for VM disks (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md#prices-storage)).
* A fee for using a dynamic or a static public IP (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md#prices-public-ip)).
* A fee for data storage in a bucket and operations with data (see [{{ objstorage-full-name }} pricing](../../storage/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using Hystax Acura Backup (see [product description](/marketplace/products/hystax/hystax-acura-backup) in {{ marketplace-name }}).


### Create a service account and access keys {#create-sa}

Hystax Acura Backup will run under a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md).
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) a service account named `hystax-acura-account` with the `editor` and `marketplace.meteringAgent` roles. Save the service account ID. You will need it later.
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/authorized-key/create.md) an authorized key for a service account. An authorized key is required to perform operations in {{ yandex-cloud }} as a service account. Save the ID and private key. You'll need them later.
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md) a static access key. A static key is required to access a bucket as a service account. Save the ID and secret key. You'll need them later.

### Configure network traffic permissions {#network-settings}

Configure network traffic permissions in the [default security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md#default-security-group). If a security group is unavailable, any incoming or outgoing VM traffic will be allowed.

If a security group is available, [add](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) to it the rules below:

| Traffic<br>direction | Description | Port<br>range | Protocol | Source<br>type | Source/Purpose |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| Incoming | http | 80 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | https | 443 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | https | 4443 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | vmware | 902 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | vmware | 902 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | iSCSI | 3260 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | udp | 12201 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | TCP | 15000 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | http | 80 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | https | 443 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | vmware | 902 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | vmware | 902 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | iSCSI | 3260 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | udp | 12201 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |

Save the security group ID. You'll need it later.

{% note info %}

Auxiliary Hystax Cloud Agent VMs are created automatically in the default security group. If you created an individual group for the Hystax Acura Backup VM, [move](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-update.md) auxiliary Hystax Cloud Agent VMs to this group once they're created.

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. See the description of the CLI's update address attribute command:

      ```bash
      yc vpc address update --help
      ```

   1. Get a list of available addresses:

      ```bash
      yc vpc address list
      ```

      Result:

      ```bash
      +----------------------+------+---------------+----------+------+
      |          ID          | NAME |    ADDRESS    | RESERVED | USED |
      +----------------------+------+---------------+----------+------+
      | e2l46k8conff8n6ru1jl |      | 84.201.177.41 | false    | true |
      +----------------------+------+---------------+----------+------+
      ```

      The `false` value of the `RESERVED` parameter of the IP address with the `ID` `e2l46k8conff8n6ru1jl` shows that this address is dynamic.
   1. Make the address static by using the `--reserved=true` key and IP address `ID`:

      ```bash
      yc vpc address update --reserved=true <IP_address_ID>
      ```

      Result:

      ```bash
      id: e2l46k8conff8n6ru1jl
      folder_id: b1g7gvsi89m34pipa3ke
      created_at: "2022-01-14T09:36:46Z"
      external_ipv4_address:
        address: 84.201.177.41
        zone_id: {{ region-id }}-b
        requirements: {}
      reserved: true
      used: true
