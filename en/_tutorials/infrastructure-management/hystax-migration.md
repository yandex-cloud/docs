# Migrating to {{ yandex-cloud }} using Hystax Acura

You can use Hystax Acura to migrate your cloud infrastructure to {{ yandex-cloud }} from another cloud platform. To migrate, create a VM with Hystax Acura in your cloud. This VM will be used to set up and perform the migration. The migration process is performed by an auxiliary VM with Hystax Acura Cloud Agent. It will migrate your VMs to {{ yandex-cloud }}. Before VM migration starts, VM replicas are created. Those replicas will be used for infrastructure deployment during migration.

To migrate VMs:
1. [Prepare your cloud](#before-begin).
1. [Create a service account and authorized key](#create-sa).
1. [Configure network traffic permissions](#network-settings).
1. [Create a VM with Hystax Acura](#create-acura-vm).
1. [Set up Hystax Acura](#setup-hystax-acura).
1. [Set up Hystax Acura Cloud Agent](#prepare-agent).
1. [Create VM replicas](#create-replicas).
1. [Create a migration plan](#prepare-migration-plan).
1. [Start migration](#start-migration).

If you no longer need the created resources, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Prepare your cloud {#before-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

{% note info %}

Please note that the infrastructure for Hystax Acura and Hystax Acura Cloud Agent and all the migrated VMs will consume your [quotas]({{ link-console-quotas }}) and you'll have to pay for them.
* A Hystax Acura VM uses 8 vCPUs, 16 GB of RAM, and a 200 GB disk.
* A Hystax Acura Cloud Agent VM uses 2 vCPUs, 4 GB of RAM, and an 8 GB disk.

{% endnote %}

The cost of the resources required to use Hystax Acura Live Migration includes:
* A fee for the disks and the continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for storage (see [{{ compute-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a dynamic or a static public IP (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).
* A fee for each completed migration (see [product description](/marketplace/products/hystax/hystax-acura-live-cloud-migration-3-7) in {{ marketplace-name }}).

## Create a service account and authorized key {#create-sa}

Hystax Acura Live Migration will run under a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md):
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) service account `hystax-acura-account` with the `editor` and the `marketplace.meteringAgent` roles.
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/authorized-key/create.md) an authorized key for a service account.

Save the following for use in subsequent steps:
1. ID of the service account.
1. The service account authorized key ID.
1. The service account private authorized key.

## Configure network traffic permissions {#network-settings}

Configure network traffic permissions in the [default security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md#default-security-group). If a security group is unavailable, any incoming or outgoing VM traffic will be allowed.

If a security group is available, [add](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) to it the rules below:

| Traffic<br>direction | Description | Port<br>range | Protocol | Source<br>type | Source/Purpose |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| Incoming | http | 80 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | https | 443 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | https | 4443 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | vmware | 902 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | vmware | 902 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | iSCSI | 3260 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | udp | 12201 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Incoming | TCP | 15,000 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | http | 80 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | https | 443 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | vmware | 902 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | vmware | 902 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | iSCSI | 3260 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Outgoing | udp | 12201 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |

Save the security group ID. You will need it when creating VMs with Hystax Acura.

         Click **Next**.
      1. Click **Download Agent** and wait for the agent to download.
      1. Unpack the downloaded OVA agent file to the VMs in your cluster.
      1. Start the VMs with the agent.

   - Windows

      1. Click **Next**.
      1. Click **Download Agent** and wait for the agent to download.
      1. Unpack the archive and install the agent from the file `hwragent.msi` on the VMs you would like to migrate.

   - Linux

      1. Select Linux distribution type:
         * **CentOS/RHEL (.rpm package)**: CentOS or Red Hat-based.
         * **Debian/Ubuntu (.deb package)**: Ubuntu or Debian.
      1. Select driver install method:
         * **Pre-built**: Install a driver binary.
         * **DKMS**: Compile as you install.
      1. Click **Next**.
      1. Commands for the VM agent install will be generated. Run the commands as required by the procedure for your distribution and install method.

   {% endlist %}

The VM will show up in the target group several minutes after the agent is installed.

## Create VM replicas {#create-replicas}

{% note alert %}

When replication starts, Hystax Acura creates a new VM with Hystax Acura Cloud Agent to run all the operations in your cloud.

{% endnote %}

Start replication:
1. Click on the Hystax logo.
1. Under **Machines Groups**, select the virtual machines to be replicated.
1. You can specify additional parameters for the `network-ssd` volume in the replication editing menu.
1. Click **Bulk actions**. In the resulting menu, select **Start Replication**.

A VM replica will include all the data of the original VM; therefore, replication can take a long time (about 40 minutes). Replication status will be displayed in the **Status** column under **Machines Groups**. Wait for status to change to `Synced` and make sure that replicas of the selected machines show up in your folder's list of {{ compute-name }} VMs.

## Create a migration plan {#prepare-migration-plan}

As soon as the replicated status of the VMs is `Synced`, you can create a migration plan. The migration plan defines which machines should be migrated to your cloud and their start order after migration.
1. Click **Add Migration plan**.
1. Enter a name for the migration plan: `YC Migration`.
1. Under **Devices & Ranks**, click ![options](../../_assets/options.svg). In the resulting menu, select **Add machine** → VM group → VM to be added to the migration plan. Repeat the steps for all the VMs to migrate.
1. In the **Subnet ID** and the **CIDR** fields, specify the ID and the CIDR of the subnet to connect the VMs to once migrated.
1. Expand the device description and edit the **Flavor name** field (parameters of the VM being created) as follows: `<platform>-<cpu>-<ram>-<core_fraction>`. For example, `2-8-16-100`.
1. In the **Port ip** field, enter a new VM IP from the current subnet.
1. Click **Save**.

## Start migration {#start-migration}

Perform the migration as per the created plan:
1. Open the **Migrate** tab.
1. Select the `YC Migration` plan and click **Next**.
1. Enter `CloudSite` in the **Cloud Site Name** field.
1. Make sure that all the required resources are in the list and click **Run migration**.

The migration process might take about 10 minutes. The status of the VM being migrated will be displayed in the **Status** column under **Machines**. Wait for the status to change to `Running`, then make sure that all the required resources have transferred and your applications are ready to run. If the migrated infrastructure is running as expected, click **Detach** on the **CloudSite** page and confirm the detach action.

## How to delete created resources {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the migration infrastructure:
1. [Delete](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md) the `hystax-acura-vm` VM.
1. [Delete](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md) the supplemental `cloud-agent` VMs.
1. [Delete](../../iam/operations/sa/delete.md) the `hystax-acura-account` service account.

If you reserved a public static IP address, [delete it](../../vpc/operations/address-delete.md).
