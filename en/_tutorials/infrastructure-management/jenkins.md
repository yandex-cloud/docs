# Automating image builds using Jenkins and Packer

Based on the specified configuration, Packer creates [VM disk images](../../compute/concepts/image.md) in {{ compute-name }}. Jenkins helps build a continuous update delivery process.

You may use images to create cloud infrastructure with [{{ TF }}](https://www.terraform.io/language#about-the-terraform-language), for example.

To install and configure Jenkins, Packer, GitHub, and {{ TF }} to work together:

1. [Before you start](#before-you-begin).
1. [Configure the environment](#prepare).
1. [Create a service account](#create-service-account).
1. [Create a VM with Jenkins](#create-jenkins-vm).
1. [Install Packer to your VM](#install-packer).
1. [Configure Jenkins](#configure-jenkins).
1. [Set up a Jenkins task](#jenkins-job).
1. [Configure the GitHub repository](#configure-github-repo).
1. [Create an image using Jenkins](#create-image).
1. [Deploy the images using {{ TF }}](#deploy-image).

If you no longer need the VM or the cluster you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost of this infrastructure includes:

* A fee for continuously running VMs (see [pricing{{ compute-full-name }}](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for storing created images (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing#prices-storage)).
* A fee for using dynamic public IP addresses (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).

{% endif %}

## Configure the environment {#prepare}

Set the software up to run:

* [Install](../../cli/operations/install-cli.md) the {{ yandex-cloud }} command-line interface.
* [Install](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) {{ TF }}. See also [{#T}](terraform-quickstart.md).
* [Download](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) the jq utility.
* [Configure](https://gitforwindows.org) Git. If you are running Windows, use Git Bash.
* [Create](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/examples) a repository branch with examples in your GitHub account.
* [Prepare](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) an SSH key to access the virtual machines.

## Create a service account {#create-service-account}

Jenkins uses service accounts to perform actions in your cloud and folder. To create a service account:

1. Get the IDs of the folder and cloud by running `yc config list`.
1. Create a service account and pass its ID to the environment variable using the following commands:

   ```
   yc iam service-account create --name <username>
   yc iam key create --service-account-name <username> -o <username.json>
   SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID=$(yc iam service-account get --name <username> --format json | jq -r .id)
   ```

   This will create a JSON file containing login credentials in the current folder.

1. Assign the service account the `admin` role for the folder where operations will be performed:

   ```
   yc resource-manager folder add-access-binding <folder_name> --role admin --subject serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID
   ```

## Create a VM with Jenkins {#create-jenkins-vm}

Jenkins will get VM image configuration changes from GitHub and then use Packer to create images in the cloud.

To create a virtual machine with Jenkins:

1. On the folder page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the VM: `jenkins-tutorial`.
1. Select an [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to put your virtual machine in.
1. Under **Image/boot disk** selection, click the **{{ marketplace-name }}** tab and then **Show more**. In the resulting window, select the [Jenkins](/marketplace/products/yc/jenkins-2-204-2) image.

   {% note info %}

   If you are configuring the Jenkins VM manually, follow the [procedure](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/).

   {% endnote %}

1. Under **Disks**, enter 15 GB for the size of the boot disk:
1. Under **Computing resources**:
   - Select the [platform](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md): Intel Ice Lake.
   - Specify the number of vCPUs and amount of RAM:
      * **vCPU** — 2.
      * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 20%
      * **RAM**: 2 GB.

1. Under **Network settings**, click **Add network** and choose the subnet to connect the virtual machine to. Under **Public IP**, assign a public address to the VM automatically or select a reserved address.
1. Under **Access**, specify the data required to access the VM:
   - Enter the username in the **Login** field.
   - In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the public key file.
      You need to [create](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys) a key pair for SSH connection yourself.
1. Click **Create VM**.

## Install Packer {#install-packer}

Packer enables you to create [virtual machine disk images](../../compute/concepts/image.md) with parameters specified in a configuration file.

{% note info %}

{{ yandex-cloud }} requires Packer 1.5 or higher.

{% endnote %}

1. Download the [Packer](https://packer.io/downloads) distribution for Linux.
1. Upload Packer to the VM you created:

   ```
   scp packer_<Packer version>_linux_amd64.zip <Login>@<Public IP address of your VM>:~/
   ```

1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM over SSH. You can use the `ssh` utility in Linux or macOS, or `PuTTY` in Windows.
1. Create a new folder, move the Packer executables there, and unpack the archive:

   ```
   sudo mkdir /opt/yandex-packer/
   sudo mv packer_<Packer version>_linux_amd64.zip /opt/yandex-packer/
   unzip packer_<Packer version>_linux_amd64.zip
   ```
1. All Jenkins system activity is performed on behalf of the `jenkins` user. Grant this user rights to launch Packer:

   ```
   sudo chmod u+x /opt/yandex-packer/packer*
   sudo chown jenkins:jenkins /opt/yandex-packer/packer*
   ```

## Configure Jenkins {#configure-jenkins}

To build images based on configurations from GitHub, configure Jenkins:

1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM over SSH. You can use the `ssh` utility in Linux or macOS, or `PuTTY` in Windows.
1. Open the password file needed to launch the configuration and copy the password:

   ```
   sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```
1. In your browser, go to `http://<Jenkins VM public IP>`. Open the Jenkins management console.
1. Enter the copied password in the **Administrator password** field and click **Continue**.
1. Choose **Select plugins to install**.

   You will need the following plugins:

   * `Pipeline`: The plugin for getting the source code from the VCS and assembling, testing, and deploying it.
   * `Git`: The plugin for working with git repositories.
   * `Credentials Binding`: The plugin for creating environment variables with authentication data.

1. Click **Install**. The selected components start to install.
1. When the installation is complete, you are prompted to create an administrator account. Fill in the form fields and click **Save and Continue**.
1. You are prompted to create a URL for Jenkins. Leave the URL as `http://<VM public IP address>/`. Click **Save and finish**.
1. Click **Start using Jenkins** to complete the installation and go to the Jenkins administration panel.

## Set up a Jenkins tasks {#jenkins-job}

Enter your {{ yandex-cloud }} authorization data and create a task to download changes from the github repository so that Jenkins can build images. The authorization data is used in the variables stored in the Packer configuration files.

1. Open the Jenkins administration panel.
1. In the top-right corner, click the username.
1. Select **Credentials**.
1. Under **Stores scoped to Jenkins**, click the `Global` link.
1. Get the ID of the subnet where images will be built by running the `yc vpc subnet list` command.
1. Click **Add credentials**. Specify the following parameters:

   1. In the **Kind** list, click `Secret text`.
   1. In the **Scope** list, leave `Global`.
   1. In the **Secret** field, enter the ID of your folder.
   1. In the **Id** field, enter `YC_FOLDER_ID`. Click **OK**.

1. Create another secret with the following parameters:

   1. **Kind**: `Secret text`.
   1. **Scope**: `Global`.
   1. **Secret**: ID of the subnet where the Jenkins VM is hosted.
   1. **ID**: `YC_SUBNET_ID`.

1. Create another secret with the following parameters:

   1. **Kind**: `Secret file`.
   1. **Scope**: `Global`.
   1. **File**: File named`<usrname>.json` from [step 1](#create-service-account).
   1. **ID**: `YC_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE`.

1. Go back to the main page of the administration panel and select **New item**.
1. Enter a name for the task, like `jenkins-tutorial`, and select **Pipeline** as the task type. Click **OK**.
1. In the window that opens, select the **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling** checkbox. This option lets you run the build every time you `push` to the `master` branch of your git repository.
1. Under **Pipeline**, select `Pipeline script from SCM` from the **Definition** list.
1. In the **SCM** list, select `Git`.
1. In the **Report URL** field, enter the URL of your GitHub fork.
1. In the **Script path** field, enter `jenkins-packer/Jenkinsfile`.
1. Leave the other fields unchanged and click **Save**.

## Configure the GitHub repository {#configure-github-repo}

In the GitHub repository's settings, set up a webhook to initiate a Jenkins build and add the public SSH key for authorization.

### Enable Webhook {#configure-webhook}

1. Open the fork of your GitHub repository in the browser.
1. Click the **Settings** tab.
1. Select **Webhooks** and click **Add webhook**.
1. In the **Payload URL** field, enter `http://<VM public IP address>/github-webhook/`.
1. Click **Add webhook**.

### Add an SSH key to GitHub {#add-ssh-key}

1. Click your GitHub avatar. In the menu that opens, select **Settings**.
1. Click **SSH and GPG keys**.
1. Click **New SSH key**.
1. In the **Title** field, enter a name for your key.
1. Paste your SSH key into the **Key** box.
1. Click **Add SSH key**.

## Create an image using Jenkins {#create-image}

The image is built in Jenkins automatically after you `push` to the `master` branch of your GitHub repository.

1. Clone the [examples](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/examples) repository fork you created while [getting started](#before-you-begin), to your computer:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:<GitHub login>/examples.git
   ```

1. Make changes to the Packer templates hosted in the `jenkins-packer/packer/` folder. You can find Packer template documentation on the developer's [website](http://packer.io/docs/templates/index.html). In the `image_family` and `source_image_family` parameters, specify the families of images to be built by Jenkins. For more detail on families, please see [Image families](../../compute/concepts/image#family).
1. Make changes to the Jenkinsfile Pipeline description file for `Jenkins` located in the root of the repository. For the Pipeline documentation, see the developer's [website](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/).
1. Upload the changes to Github:

   ```
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Build update"
   git push
   ```

1. Open the Jenkins administration panel and check the task status.
1. If all the settings are correct, the image assembly is launched. You can see the result in the build logs.

{% note info %}

When configuring a Jenkins job under **GitHub Hook log**, you may encounter the `Polling has not run yet` error. If this happens, you should run a manual build the first time around.

{% endnote %}

Then there are three new images in **Compute Cloud** under **Images**:

* `Debian`: The basic image with the latest updates.
* `Nginx`: `Debian`-based image containing nginx web server.
* `Django`: An image with the `Django` framework, based on the Debian image.

## Deploy the images {#deploy-image}

Once the images are created, you can use them to create your virtual machines. Create a test infrastructure using {{ TF }}:

1. In the folder with the fork, go to the directory with the {{ TF }} files:

   ```
   cd examples/jenkins-packer/terraform
   ```

1. Rename the `terraform.tfvars_example` file:

   ```
   mv terraform.tfvars_example terraform.tfvars
   ```

2. Fill in the file fields with the applicable values. See also the [{{ TF }}](https://www.terraform.io/language#about-the-terraform-language) and [{{ yandex-cloud }} provider]({{ tf-provider-link }}) documentation.
3. Initialize the {{ TF }} provider by running `terraform init`.
4. Execute `terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"`. Check the configuration created.
5. Execute `terraform apply` and confirm that you want to create the infrastructure by entering `yes` to the terminal prompt.

This will create:

1. A cloud network.
1. Subnets in all availability zones.
1. Virtual machines from images created by Packer. Virtual machines with nginx get public IP addresses. All virtual machines are connected to subnets.

## How to delete created resources {#clear-out}

To release folder resources:

* [Delete the created VMs](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md).
* [Delete the created images](../../compute/operations/image-control/delete.md).
* [Delete the service account](../../iam/operations/sa/delete.md) and `<uername.json>`.
* [Delete the network and the subnets](../../vpc/operations/network-delete.md).

To delete the resources created with {{ TF }}, run `terraform destroy`.
