{% note info %}

This guide is intended for Linux users. On Windows, you can follow its steps in [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

{% endnote %}

You will create a [function](../functions/concepts/function.md) and a [Node.js app](https://ydb.tech/en/docs/reference/ydb-sdk/example/example-nodejs) that will make small queries to a {{ ydb-short-name }} database. You will deploy the application using Bash scripts and use the `tcs` command to compile it.

A function with an associated [service account](../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) is authorized in {{ ydb-short-name }} via the metadata service.

The application creates a {{ ydb-short-name }} database connection driver, a session, and a transaction, and runs a query using the `ydb` library. This library is installed as a [dependency](../functions/lang/nodejs/dependencies.md) when creating a function version. The DB connection parameters are passed to the application via environment variables.

To set up a connection to the {{ ydb-short-name }} database:

1. [Prepare your cloud](#before-begin).
1. [Prepare the environment](#prepare-environment).
1. [Create a service account](#create-sa).
1. [Create an authorized key](#create-key).
1. [Create a {{ ydb-short-name }} database](#create-database).
1. [Create a function](#create-function).
1. [Test the function](#test-function).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Prepare your cloud {#before-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](./_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}


### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The infrastructure support cost for this scenario includes:

* A fee for using the function (see [{{ sf-full-name }} pricing](../functions/pricing.md)).
* A fee for querying the database (see [{{ ydb-full-name }} pricing](../ydb/pricing/serverless.md)).


## Prepare the environment {#prepare-environment}

1. Clone the [examples repository](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/examples/tree/master/serverless/functions/YDB-connect-from-serverless-function) using Git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yandex-cloud/examples.git
   ```

1. In the repository, go to the folder with the project files: `examples/serverless/functions/YDB-connect-from-serverless-function`.
1. Install and initialize the [{{ yandex-cloud }} CLI](../cli/quickstart.md).
1. Install the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) utility. In the root of the folder with the project files, start the terminal and run the command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install jq
   ```

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) by running the command below:

   ```
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_current.x | sudo -E bash - \
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```

1. Install dependencies by running the command below:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Create a service account {#create-sa}

{% list tabs %}

   For more information about the `yc iam service-account create` command, see the [CLI reference](../cli/cli-ref/managed-services/iam/service-account/create.md).

- {{ TF }}

   If you do not have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   1. In the configuration file, describe the service account parameters:

      ```
      resource "yandex_iam_service_account" "sa" {
        name = "sa-function"
      }
      ```

      For more information about resources you can create using {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/iam_service_account).

   1. Make sure the configuration files are valid.

      1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run the check using this command:

         ```
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal will display a list of created resources and their parameters. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Deploy cloud resources.

      1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

         ```

      {% include [name-format](../_includes/name-format.md) %}

   1. Under **Database type**, select the **Serverless** option.
   1. Click **Create database**.

      Wait until the database starts. When a database is being created, it has the `Provisioning` status. When it's ready for use, the status changes to `Running`.

   1. Click on the name of the created database.
   1. Save the **Endpoint** and **Database** field values under **Connection**. You will need them in the next step.

{% endlist %}

## Create a function {#create-function}

{% note info %}

Before creating a function, make sure the `.env` file and the `create-func.sh` and `create-func-ver.sh` files from the `deploy` folder have the `LF` (Line Feed) character set.

{% endnote %}

1. Edit the `.env` file:

   * `ENDPOINT`: String in <protocol>://<**Endpoint** field value under **Connection**> format. For example, if the protocol is `grpcs` and the endpoint is `{{ ydb.host-serverless }}:{{ ydb.port-serverless }}`, enter `{{ ydb.ep-serverless }}`.
   * `DATABASE`: Value of the **Database** field under **Connection**.
   * `FUNCTION_NAME`: `func-test-ydb`.
   * `FOLDER_ID`: ID of the folder.
   * `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID`: ID of the `sa-function` service account.

1. Start the command line in the project root and run the command:

   ```bash
   ./deploy/create-func.sh
   ```

   This script creates a new function in your folder and makes it public.

1. Create the function version:

   ```bash
   ./deploy/create-func-ver.sh
   ```

## Test the function {#test-function}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the function is located.
   1. In the list of services, select **{{ sf-name }}**.
   1. Select the `func-test-ydb` function.
   1. Go to the **Overview** tab.
   1. Under **General information**, click the function call link.
   1. In the browser address bar, add the `api_key` parameter to the link, such as `?api_key=b95`.
   1. If a connection to the DB is successful, a table named `b95` is created and a single record is added to it. A message in JSON format appears on the page, such as:

      ```json
      {
         "info": "b95 table created, one record inserted"
      }
      ```

{% endlist %}

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources you created:

* [Delete the database](../ydb/operations/manage-databases.md#delete-db).
* [Delete the function](../functions/operations/function/function-delete.md).
