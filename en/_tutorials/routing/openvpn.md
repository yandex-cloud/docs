# Creating a VPN connection using OpenVPN

This scenario describes how to configure an OpenVPN instance to access {{ yandex-cloud }} VMs over an encrypted connection. It considers the option to configure an OpenVPN gateway with username and password-based access.

To set up a VPN tunnel:

1. [Before you start](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create subnets and a test VM](#create-environment).
1. [Create an OpenVPN instance](#create-openvpn-instance).
1. [Get the administrator password](#get-admin-password).
1. [Create an OpenVPN user](#configure-openvpn).
1. [Connect to the VPN](#test-vpn).

If you no longer need the OpenVPN instance, [delete it](#clear-out).

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost of infrastructure support for OpenVPN includes:

* A fee for continuously running VMs (see [pricing{{ compute-full-name }}](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a dynamic external IP address (see [pricing {{ vpc-full-name }}](../../vpc/pricing.md)).

{% endif %}

## Create subnets and a test VM {#create-environment}

To connect cloud resources to the internet, make sure you have [networks](../../vpc/operations/network-create.md) and [subnets](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md).

Create a test [VM](../../compute/operations/vm-create/create-linux-vm.md) without a public IP and connect it to the subnet.

## Create an OpenVPN instance {#create-openvpn-instance}

Create a VM in {{ yandex-cloud }} to serve as a gateway for a VPN tunnel.

1. Open your folder and click **Create resource**. Select **Virtual machine**.

1. Enter a name for the VM, for example, `openvpn-instance`.

1. Select the subnet availability zone to connect the OpenVPN instance to and where the test VM is already located.

1. Under **Image/boot disk selection**, click the **{{ marketplace-name }}** tab, and select the [OpenVPN](/marketplace/products/yc/openvpn-access-server) image.

1. In the **Network settings** section, choose the required network and subnet and assign a public IP to the VM either by selecting it from the list or automatically.

   Only use static public IP addresses [from the list](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/vpc/operations/get-static-ip) or [make](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/vpc/operations/set-static-ip) the IP address static. Dynamic IP addresses may change after the VM reboots and the connections will no longer work.

1. In the **Access** field, enter the login and SSH key to access the VM.

1. Click **Create VM**.

## Get the administrator password {#get-admin-password}

The `openvpn` user with administrator privileges was created on the OpenVPN server in advance. An initial password is generated automatically. To access the admin panel, get the password:

1. Connect to the virtual machine over SSH:

   ```
   ssh <VM public IP>
   ```

1. Run the command:

   ```
   sudo cat /usr/local/openvpn_as/tmp/initial_ovpn_pass && echo
   ```

   The password, which is located in a text file, will be displayed on the screen.

   Log in to the admin panel using the `openvpn` username and the obtained password.

## Create an OpenVPN user {#configure-openvpn}

To establish an OpenVPN connection, enter the username and password of the user on the client machine. Create a new user:

1. In the browser, open a URL like `https://<VM public IP address>:943/admin/`.
1. Specify the `openvpn` username and the password obtained in the previous step.
1. Click **Agree**. This opens the main screen of the OpenVPN admin panel.
1. Go to the **User management** tab and select **User permissions**.
1. In the list of users, enter the name of the new user in the **New Username** field, like `test-user`.
1. Click the pencil icon in the **More Settings** column and set the new user's password in the **Password** field.
1. Click **Save settings**.
1. Click **Update running server**.

You can then connect to the VPN using [OpenVPN Connect](https://openvpn.net/client-connect-vpn-for-windows/).

## Connect to the VPN {#test-vpn}

To check that a connection is established and working properly, connect to the VPN and run the `ping` command for the test VM internal address:

1. Start the OpenVPN Connect Client.
1. Create a new connection. Type the VM IP address, enter `test-user` as the user, and enter the user's password.
1. Enable the created connection.
1. Open the terminal and run the command `ping <internal IP address of the test VM>`. If the command is executed, the VM can be accessed via OpenVPN.

## Delete the created resources {#clear-out}

If you no longer need the OpenVPN instance, [delete](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md) the `openvpn-instance` VM and the test VM.

If you reserved a public static IP address, [delete it](../../vpc/operations/address-delete.md).
