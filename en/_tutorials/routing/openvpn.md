# Connecting to a cloud network using OpenVPN

With TCP or UDP port tunnels and asymmetric encryption, you can create virtual networks. VPN can be used, for example, to:

* Connect geographically remote networks.
* Connect freelancers to the office network.
* Set up an encrypted connection over an open Wi-Fi network.

[OpenVPN Access Server](/marketplace/products/yc/openvpn-access-server) is compatible with the [open-source version](https://github.com/OpenVPN) of OpenVPN and built on its basis. It provides clients for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS and is used to manage connections using a web interface.

An example of auto-connect and login-and-password configurations is shown below. To create a virtual network:

1. [Before you start](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create subnets and a test VM](#create-environment).
1. [Start the VPN server](#create-vpn-server).
1. [Configure network traffic permissions](#network-settings).
1. [Get the administrator's password](#get-admin-password).
1. [Activate license](#get-license).
1. [Create an OpenVPN user](#configure-openvpn).
1. [Connect to the VPN](#test-vpn).

If you no longer need the VPN server, [delete the VM](#clear-out).

## Prepare your cloud {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}



### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost of infrastructure support for OpenVPN includes:

* A fee for the disks and continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a dynamic or a static public IP (see [pricing{{ vpc-full-name }}](../../vpc/pricing.md)).
* A fee for the OpenVPN Access Server license (when using more than two connections).


## Create subnets and a test VM {#create-environment}

To connect cloud resources to the internet, make sure you have [networks](../../vpc/operations/network-create.md) and [subnets](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md).

Create a [VM](../../compute/operations/vm-create/create-linux-vm.md) for the test without a public IP and connect it to a subnet.

## Start the VPN server {#create-vpn-server}

Create a VM to be the gateway for VPN connections:

1. On the [folder page] ({{ link-console-main }}), click **Create resource** and select Virtual machine.On the folder page, click Create resource and select **Virtual machine**.

1. Under **Basic parameters**:

   * Enter a name `vpn-server` and description for the VM.
   * Select the [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) where the test VM is already located.

1. Under **Image/boot disk selection**:

   * Click the **{{ marketplace-name }}** tab.
   * Click **Show more**.
   * In the public image list, select [OpenVPN Access Server](/marketplace/products/yc/openvpn-access-server) and click **Use**.

1. Under **Disks**, enter 10 GB as your disk size.

1. Under **Computing resources**, specify:

   * vCPU: 2.
   * RAM: 2 GB.

1. Under **Network settings**:

   * Select the required network and subnet and assign a public IP address to the VM either by selecting it from the list or automatically.

      Only use static public IP addresses [from the list](https://cloud.yandex.ru/docs/vpc/operations/get-static-ip) or [make](https://cloud.yandex.ru/docs/vpc/operations/set-static-ip) the IP address static. Dynamic IP addresses may change after the VM reboots and the connections will no longer work.

   * If a list of **Security groups** is available, select the [security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md). If you leave this field empty, the [default security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md#default-security-group) will be assigned.

1. Under **Access**, specify the data required to access the VM:

   * In the **Login** field, enter the SSH username, for example, `yc-user`.
   * In the **SSH key** field, paste the [public SSH key](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys).

1. Click **Create VM**.

1. A window will appear informing you of the pricing type: BYOL (Bring Your Own License).

1. Click **Create**.

## Configure network traffic permissions {#network-settings}

[Security groups](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) act as a virtual firewall for incoming and outgoing traffic. See Learn more about a [default security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md#default-security-group).

If security groups are not available in your cloud, any traffic will be allowed.

1. For OpenVPN Access Server operation, [add](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) the following rules to a security group:

   | Traffic</br>direction | Description | Port | Protocol | Source</br>type | Source/Purpose |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Incoming | VPN Server | 443 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
   | Incoming | VPN Server | 1194 | UDP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |
   | Incoming | Admin Web UI,</br>Client Web UI | 943 | TCP | CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 |

   A VPN server can redirect traffic from the `HTTPS` port, so leave the only `TCP 443` port open if necessary. See also the settings in the **Configuration** → **Network Settings** tab of the server admin panel.

1. If you have configured your own security group, check that traffic between the VPN server and the required resources is allowed. For example, they are in the same group and the [Self rule](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md#rules-types) was created for the entire group.

## Get the administrator's password {#get-admin-password}.

The openvpn user with administrator privileges was created on the `OpenVPN` server in advance. The password is generated automatically when creating a VM

You can get the password in a [serial port output](../../compute/operations/vm-info/get-serial-port-output) or the serial console. The password will display in the following string:

```
To login, please use the "openvpn" account with <`openvpn` user password> password.
```

Log in to the admin panel using the `openvpn` username and the obtained password.

If you do not get the password after [launching the VPN server](#create-vpn-server) for the first time, you need to re-create the VM running the [OpenVPN Access Server](/marketplace/products/yc/openvpn-access-server). The password will not display in a reboot.

## Activate license {#get-license}

{% note info %}

If you have up to two VPN connections, use the product for free (no activation required).

{% endnote %}

To activate the license:

1. Create an account on [openvpn.net](https://myaccount.openvpn.com/signup).
1. Enter the confirmation code received by email.
1. In the **Where would you like to Go?** window, select the **"Remember my choice"** option and select the **Access serve** product.
1. In the **Tell us more** window, select the purpose: **Business use** or **Personal Use**.
1. On the **Subscriptions** tab, select the maximum number of connections in the **How many VPN connections do you need?** field. and click **Create**.
1. Your subscription will be displayed on the screen: **Subscription 1**.
1. To copy the activation key, click **Copy Key** under **Subscription Key**.

Enter the activation key in the admin panel at `https://<VM public IP address>/admin/`.

## Create an OpenVPN user {#configure-openvpn}

OpenVPN Access Server provides two web interfaces:

1. Client Web UI at `https://<VM public IP address>/`. The interface is used by ordinary users to download client programs and configuration profiles.
1. Admin Web UI at `https://<VM public IP address>/admin/`. The interface is used to configure a server.

{% note info %}

By default, a server has a self-signed certificate installed. If you need to replace this certificate, follow the [procedure](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/installing-a-valid-ssl-web-certificate-in-access-server/).

{% endnote %}

To create a user, enter the admin panel:

1. In the browser, open a URL like `https://<VM public IP address>/admin/`.
1. Enter the `openvpn` username and password obtained from the `initial_ovpn_pass` file.
1. Click **Agree**. This opens the main screen of the OpenVPN admin panel.
1. Go to the **User management** tab and select **User permissions**.
1. In the list of users, enter the name of the new user in the **New Username** field, like `test-user`.
1. Click the pencil icon in the **More Settings** column and set the new user's password in the **Password** field.
1. Click **Save settings**.
1. Click **Update running server**.

## Connect to the VPN {#test-vpn}

In the admin panel, you can download [OpenVPN Connect](https://openvpn.net/vpn-client/) for Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS. You can also use [OpenSource clients](https://openvpn.net/source-code/) for connection.

To check that a connection is established and working properly, connect to the VPN and run the `ping` command for the test VM internal address:

{% list tabs %}

- Linux

   1. Install the `openvpn` using package manager:

      ```
      sudo apt update && sudo apt install openvpn
      ```

      * Enter the admin panel at `https://<VM public IP address>/admin/`.
      * Open the **User management** → **User permissions** tab.
      * Enable the **Allow Auto-login** option in the user line.

   1. Configure routing:

      * Enter the admin panel at `https://<VM public IP address>/admin/`.
      * Open the **Configuration** → **VPN Settings** tab.
      * Under **Routing**, disable the **Should client Internet traffic be routed through the VPN?** option.

   1. Download a configuration profile:

      * In the browser, open the user panel at `https://<VM public IP address>/`.
      * Log in using the `test-user` username and password.
      * In the **Available Connection Profiles** section  click **Yourself (autologin profile)** and upload `profile-1.ovpn` file.
      * You can also download a configuration file in the admin panel at `https://<VM public IP address>/admin/`.

   1. Upload the configuration file to a Linux machine:

      ```
      scp profile-1.ovpn user@<IP address>:~
      ```

   1. Move the configuration file to the `/etc/openvpn` folder:
      ```
      sudo mv /home/user/profile-1.ovpn /etc/openvpn
      ```

   1. Change the file extension from `ovpn` to `conf`:
      ```
      sudo mv /etc/openvpn/profile-1.ovpn /etc/openvpn/profile-1.conf
      ```

   1. Close access to the file:
      ```
      sudo chown root:root /etc/openvpn/profile-1.conf
      sudo chmod 600 /etc/openvpn/profile-1.conf
      ```

   1. The VPN connection will turn on automatically after restarting. To start the connection manually, run the command:
      ```
      sudo openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/profile-1.conf
      ```
      Result:
      ```
