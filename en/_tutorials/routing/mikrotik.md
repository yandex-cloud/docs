# Installing a Mikrotik CHR virtual router

In {{ yandex-cloud }}, you can deploy a virtual Mikrotik Cloud Hosted Router from a ready-made VM image. To install Mikrotik Cloud Hosted Router and check its operability:

1. [Before you start](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create a VM with Mikrotik Cloud Hosted Router](#create-router).
1. [Log in to your VM and change your password](#change-password).
1. [Create a test VM](#create-test-vm).
1. [Check the connection between the router and test VM](#test-connection).

If you no longer need these resources, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

{% note alert %}

When you use a Mikrotik Cloud Hosted Router image without a license, the router throughput is limited to 1 Mbps. To remove this limit, [install a license](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:CHR#CHR_Licensing).

{% endnote %}

The cost of using a virtual router and test VM includes:

* A fee for the disks and continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* A fee for using a public IP address (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md));

## Create a VM with Mikrotik Cloud Hosted Router {#create-router}

1. Open your folder and click **Create resource**. Select **Virtual machine**.
1. Enter a name for the VM, like `mikrotik-router`.
1. Select an [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) with a subnet. If you don't know which availability zone you need, leave the default.
1. Under **Images from {{ marketplace-name }}**, click **Select** and select the [Cloud Hosted Router](/marketplace/products/f2etgh9qd7e7h47jrvr4) image.
1. Under **Computing resources**:
   - Select the VM's [platform](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md).
   - Specify the number of vCPUs and amount of RAM:
      * **Platform**: Intel Ice Lake.
      * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 100%
      * **vCPU**: 2.
      * **RAM**: 2 GB.
1. In the **Network settings** section, choose the required network and subnet and assign a public IP to the VM either by selecting it from the list or automatically. If you don't have a network or subnet, create them on the VM creation screen.
1. In the **Access** field, enter the login and SSH key to access the VM. Note that you only need this data for VM creation. You can't use the data for router access.
1. Click **Create VM**.

Creating the VM may take several minutes. When the VM's status changes to `RUNNING`, you can log in.

{% note alert %}

Set a complex administrator password immediately after VM creation.

{% endnote %}

## Change the administrator password on the router {#change-password}

The router is created with a public IP address, so you need to change the default administrator password for security reasons.

1. Open the `mikrotik-router` VM page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
1. Copy the VM's public address and open it in your browser. The initial router setup screen opens.
1. Enter the VM's internal **IP address** in the IP Address field.
1. On the page that opens, enter the new administrator password, confirm it, and click **Apply Configuration**. You can make other setting later.

## Create a test VM {#create-test-vm}

Create a test VM in the subnet that hosts the router, to test connectivity between the router and VM.

1. On the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) folder page, click **Create resource** and select **Virtual machine**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter the VM name: `test-vm`.
1. Choose the same [Availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) that the `mikrotik-router` is in.
1. Under **Images from {{ marketplace-name }}** , select the **Ubuntu** image.
1. Under **Computing resources**:
   - Select the VM's [platform](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md).
   - Specify the necessary number of vCPUs and amount of RAM.
   * **Platform**: Intel Ice Lake.
   * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: 20%
   * **vCPU**: 2.
   * **RAM**: 1 GB.

1. Under **Network settings**, select the network and subnet hosting the `mikrotik-router` VM.
1. In the **Public address** field, choose **No address**:
1. In the **Access** field, enter the login and SSH key to access the VM.
1. Click **Create VM**.

### Check the connection between the router and test VM {#test-connection}

{% note alert %}

If you use WinBox to access the router, connect to the router using the VM's IP address. MAC access is not supported in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

{% endnote %}

Make sure that a network connection has been established between the router and test VM:

1. Open the router's administrative interface in the browser.
1. Click **Terminal**.
1. In the terminal that opens, run `ping <internal IP address of the test VM>`.

If the packets reach the test VM, you can start configuring the router. To learn how to work with the router, see the [Mikrotik documentation](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Main_Page).

## Delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for your deployed resources, [delete](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md) the `mikrotik-router` and `test-vm` VMs.

If you reserved a public static IP address, [delete it](../../vpc/operations/address-delete.md).
