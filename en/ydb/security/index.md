# Access management in {{ ydb-name }}

{{ yandex-cloud }} users can only perform operations on resources that are allowed by the roles assigned to them. If a user doesn't have any roles assigned, almost all operations are forbidden.

To allow access to {{ ydb-short-name }} resources (databases and their users), assign users the relevant roles from the list below. Currently, a role can only be assigned to a parent resource (folder or cloud). Roles are inherited by nested resources.

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see [{#T}](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation.
