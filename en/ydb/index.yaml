description:
- "<i>Yandex Database</i> (YDB) is a distributed fault-tolerant NewSQL DBMS. YDB provides high availability and scalability while simultaneously ensuring strict consistency and ACID transaction support. Queries are made using an SQL dialect (<a href=\"/docs/ydb/yql/reference/overview\">YQL</a>)."
- "YDB can be used in two modes: 
<ul> 
<li><i>Serverless mode</i>: The user pays for data operations.</li> 
<li><i>Dedicated mode</i>: The user pays for allocated computing resources on an hourly basis.</li> 
</ul> 
Data is used via an SQL dialect (<a href=\"/docs/ydb/yql/reference/overview\">YQL</a>). In serverless mode, YDB also provides a layer compatible with the Amazon DynamoDB API."

- "YDB is an alternative to the other solutions in the following cases: 
<ul> 
<li>When using NoSQL systems if strict data consistency is required.</li> 
<li>When using NoSQL systems if you need to make transactional changes to data stored in different rows of one or more tables.</li> 
<li>In systems that need to process and store large amounts of data with infinite scalability.</li> 
<li>In systems with low load, when support for a separate DB instance will be a waste of money (consider using YDB in serverless mode instead).</li> 
<li>In systems with unpredictable or seasonally fluctuating load (you can add/reduce computing resources on request and/or in serverless mode).</li> 
<li>In systems that shard load across relational DB instances.</li> 
<li>When developing a new product natively designed for an expected high load beyond the capabilities of traditional relational databases.</li> 
</ul>"
