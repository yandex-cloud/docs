    <i>Yandex Database</i> (YDB) is a distributed fault-tolerant Distributed SQL
    DBMS. YDB provides high availability and scalability while simultaneously
    ensuring strict consistency and ACID transaction support. Queries are made
    using an SQL dialect (<a href="/docs/ydb/yql/reference/overview">YQL</a>).
  - >-
    YDB can be used in two modes:  <ul>  <li><i>Serverless mode</i>: The user
    pays for data operations.</li>  <li><i>Dedicated mode</i>: The user pays for
    allocated computing resources on an hourly basis.</li>  </ul>  Data is used
    via an SQL dialect (<a href="/docs/ydb/yql/reference/overview">YQL</a>). In
    serverless mode, YDB also provides a layer compatible with the Amazon
    DynamoDB API.
  - >-
    YDB is an alternative to the other solutions in the following cases:  <ul> 
    <li>When using NoSQL systems if strict data consistency is required.</li> 
    <li>When using NoSQL systems if you need to make transactional changes to
    data stored in different rows of one or more tables.</li>  <li>In systems
    that need to process and store large amounts of data with infinite
    scalability.</li>  <li>In systems with low load, when support for a separate
    DB instance will be a waste of money (consider using YDB in serverless mode
    instead).</li>  <li>In systems with unpredictable or seasonally fluctuating
    load (you can add/reduce computing resources on request and/or in serverless
    mode).</li>  <li>In systems that shard load across relational DB
    instances.</li>  <li>When developing a new product natively designed for an
    expected high load beyond the capabilities of traditional relational
    databases.</li>  </ul>
