# General questions

#### What's {{ ydb-short-name }}? {#what-is-ydb}

{{ ydb-short-name }} — is a distributed fault-tolerant NewSQL DBMS. YDB provides high availability and scalability while simultaneously ensuring strict consistency and ACID transaction support. Queries are made using an SQL dialect (YQL).

{{ ydb-short-name }} is a fully managed database. DB instances are created through the {{ ydb-short-name }} database management service.

#### What features does {{ ydb-short-name }} provide? {#ydb-features}

{{ ydb-short-name }} provides high availability and data security through synchronous replication in three availability zones. {{ ydb-short-name }} also ensures even load distribution across available hardware resources. This means that you don't need to order resources, Yandex Database automatically allocates and releases resources based on the user load.

#### What consistency model does YDB use? {#ydb-consistency}

To read data, {{ ydb-short-name }} uses a model of strict data consistency.

#### How do I design a primary key? {#create-pk}

To design the primary key properly, follow the rules given below.

* Avoid situations where the main load falls on a single partition of a table. With even load distribution, it's easier to achieve high overall performance.

    This rule implies that you shouldn't use a monotonically increasing sequence, such as timestamp, as a table's primary key.

* The fewer table partitions used during query execution, the faster it's executed. For greater performance, follow the one query — one partition rule.

* Avoid situations where a small part of the DB is under much heavier load than the rest of the DB.

For more information, see [{#T}](../best_practices/schema_design.md).

#### How do I evenly distribute the load across table partitions? {#balance-shard-load}

You can use the following techniques to evenly distribute the load across table partitions and increase overall DB performance.

* To avoid using monotonically increasing primary key values, you can:
    * Change the order of its components.
    * use a hash of the key column values as the primary key.

* Reduce the number of partitions used in a single query.

For more information, see [{#T}](../best_practices/schema_design.md#balance-shard-load).

#### Can I use NULL in a key column? {#null}

In {{ ydb-short-name }}, all columns, including key ones, may contain a `NULL` value, but we don't recommend using ` NULL` as values in key columns.

According to the SQL standard (ISO/IEC 9075), you can't compare `NULL` with other values. Therefore, the use of concise SQL statements with simple comparison operators may lead to skipping rows containing NULL during filtering, for example.

#### Is there an optimal size of a database row? {#string-size}

To achieve high performance, we don't recommend writing rows larger than 8 MB and key columns larger than 2 KB to the DB.

For more information about limits, see [{#T}](../api/limits.md).

#### How are secondary indexes used in {{ ydb-short-name }}? {#secondary_indexes}

Secondary indexes in {{ ydb-short-name }} are global and can be non-unique.

For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/secondary_indexes.md).

#### How is paginated output performed? {#paging}

To organize paginated output, we recommend selecting data sorted by primary key sequentially, limiting the number of rows with the `LIMIT` keyword. We do not recommend using the `OFFSET` keyword to solve this problem.

For more information, see [{#T}](../best_practices/paging.md).

#### How do I effectively upload large amounts of data to {{ ydb-short-name }}? {#batch_upload}

To speed up uploading large amounts of data, follow these recommendations:

* When creating a table, explicitly specify the required number of partitions or their boundaries. This will help you effectively use system bandwidth as soon as you start uploading data by avoiding unnecessary re-partitioning of the table.

* Don't insert data in separate transactions for each row. It's more efficient to insert multiple rows at once (batch inserts). This reduces the overhead on the transaction mechanism itself.

* In addition to the previous step, within each transaction (batch), insert rows from the primary key-sorted set of data to minimize the number of partitions that the transaction affects.

* Avoid writing data sequentially in ascending or descending order of the primary key value to evenly distribute the load across all table partitions.

For more information, see [{#T}](../best_practices/batch_upload.md).

#### How do I delete expired data? {#ttl}

To effectively remove expired data, we recommend using [{#T}](../concepts/ttl.md).
