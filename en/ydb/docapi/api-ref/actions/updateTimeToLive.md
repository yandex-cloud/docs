# UpdateTimeToLive method

Enables or disables TTL for the specified table.

If successful, returns the current `TimeToLiveSpecification` value. The operation may take up to an hour. Additional method calls for the same table will throw a `ValidationException` error until the operation is completed.

The TTL checking mechanism compares the current time in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) format with the time stored in the TTL attribute of an item. If it's less than the current time, the item is marked as obsolete and subsequently deleted.

Items with an expired TTL are usually deleted within two days, the deletion time depends on the nature of the workload. Obsolete but not yet deleted items are displayed when reading, querying, and scanning data. When deleting items from a table, they are immediately deleted from the local and global secondary indexes the same way as a standard delete operation.

Obsolete items are deleted to provide sufficient bandwidth for other data operations.
