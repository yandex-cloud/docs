# Create databases

Create a [database](../concepts/databases.md#database) using {{ ydb-full-name }} from the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console.

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

1. Log in to the [management console](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru). If you aren't registered, go to the management console and follow the instructions.
1. [On the billing page](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/billing), make sure you linked a [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md), and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you don't have a billing account, [create one](../../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. If you don't have a folder, [create one](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/create.md).
