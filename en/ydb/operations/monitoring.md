# Monitoring DB status

DB status details are available in the management console. You can view them on the **Monitoring** tab of the DB management page or in {{ monitoring-full-name }}.

Diagnostic information about the DB status is presented as charts. The chart update period is 1 minute.

{% include [note-monitoring-auto-units](../../_includes/mdb/note-monitoring-auto-units.md) %}

{% if audience != "internal" %}

You can [configure alerts](#monitoring-integration) in {{ monitoring-full-name }} to receive notifications about DB failures. In {{ monitoring-full-name }}, there are two alert thresholds: `Warning` and `Alarm`. If the specified threshold is exceeded, you'll receive alerts via the configured [notification channels](../../monitoring/concepts/alerting.md#notification-channel).

{% endif %}
