This section describes available timeouts and provides examples of their usage in various programming languages.

## Operation timeout

The ``operation_timeout`` value shows the time during which the query result is interesting to the user. If the operation fails during this time, the server returns an error with the ``Timeout`` code and tries to terminate the query, but its cancellation is not guaranteed. So the query that the user was returned the ``Timeout`` error for can be both successfully executed on the server and canceled.

## Timeout for canceling an operation

The ``cancel_after`` value shows the time after which the server will start canceling the query, if it can be canceled. If canceled, the server returns the ``Cancelled`` error code.

## Transport timeout

The client can set a transport timeout for each query. This value lets you determine the amount of time that the client is ready to wait for a response from the server. If the server doesn't respond during this time, the client will get a transport error with the ``DeadlineExceeded`` code.

## Using timeouts

We recommend that you always set an operation timeout and transport timeout. The value of the transport timeout should be 50-100 milliseconds more than that of the operation timeout, that way there is some time left for the client to get a server error with the ``Timeout`` code.

Below are examples of using timeouts in various programming languages:

- Python

  ```python
  from kikimr.public.sdk.python import client as ydb
  
  def execute_in_tx(session, query):
    settings = ydb.BaseRequestSettings()
    settings = settings.with_timeout(0.5)  # transport timeout
    settings = settings.with_operation_timeout(0.4)  # operation timeout
    settings = settings.with_cancel_after(0.4)  # cancel after timeout
    session.transaction().execute(
        query,
        commit_tx=True,
        settings=settings,
    )
  ```

{% endlist %}
