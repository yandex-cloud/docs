# PRAGMA

Redefines settings of various kinds. Affects the expressions that follow. If necessary and logically possible, you can change the value of this setting several times within a given query to make it different at different execution steps.

**Syntax**

`PRAGMA x.y = "z";` or `PRAGMA x.y("z", "z2", "z3");`:

* `x`: (optional) The category of the setting.
* `y`: The name of the setting.
* `z`: (optional for flags) The value of the setting. The following suffixes are acceptable:
    * `Kb`, `Mb`, `Gb`:  For the data amounts.
    * `sec`, `min`, `h`, `d`: For the time values.

With some exceptions, you can return the settings values to their default states using `PRAGMA my_pragma = default;`.

**Example**

```sql
PRAGMA AutoCommit;
```

Warning code or `*` | — | Action: <ul><li>`disable`: disable.</li><li>`error`: treat as an error.</li><li>`default`: go back to the default behavior.</li></ul> The warning code is returned with the text itself (it's displayed in the console on the right).<br><br>**Example**<br>`PRAGMA Warning("error", "*");`<br> `PRAGMA Warning("disable", "1101");`<br> `PRAGMA Warning("default", "4503");`<br> In this case, all the warnings are treated as errors, except for the warning `1101` (that will be disabled) and `4503` (that will be processed by default and remain a warning). |
