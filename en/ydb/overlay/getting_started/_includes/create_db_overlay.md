## Yandex cloud database {#yandex-cloud}

### Creating a database {#db-create}

Create a [database](../../concepts/databases.md#database) using {{ ydb-full-name }} in the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console.

#### Before you start {#before-you-begin}

To get started in {{ yandex-cloud }}:

1. Log in to [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). If you aren't registered, go to the management console and follow the instructions.
1. [On the billing page]({{ link-console-billing }}) make sure that you have enabled a [billing account](../../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) and that it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you don't have a billing account, [create one](../../../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. If you don't have a folder, [create one](../../../resource-manager/operations/folder/create.md).

#### Create a database {#control-panel}

You can create a database in a Serverless configuration or with dedicated servers. For more information about differences in configurations, see [Serverless and Dedicated modes](../../concepts/serverless_and_dedicated.md).

{% note info %}

For the Amazon DynamoDB-compatible mode, use a serverless database configuration.
