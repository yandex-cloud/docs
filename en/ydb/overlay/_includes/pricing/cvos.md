You can get a guaranteed discount on service resource usage when you commit for a month, year, or three years. To see the resources you can get a discount on:

1. Go to the Billing section.
1. Click on the desired billing account.
1. Choose **Commitments** in the left-hand menu.

A CVoS guarantees a discount on usage, but doesn't guarantee the availability of the resources ordered. Read more about CVoS in the Billing documentation.
