# Epics

An epic is a type of issue that allows you to group other issues based on a shared theme. Epics can include issues from different queues and sprints.

Epics are especially effective with **Scrum** boards for [planning your team's workload](create-agile-sprint.md#section_sjg_111_2gb). Issues in epics can be distributed within multiple sprints. This will let you predict labor costs and deadlines.

{% note warning %}

An issue can only be part of one epic at one time.

    An epic card displays the total number of issues within the epic, the total [Story Points](agile.md#dlen_sp) for all issues, the total number of assignees, and the queues whose issues are included in the epic.
