# Deleting a queue

{% note alert %}

Deleting a queue is permanent. This operation can't be undone. Make sure you [moved important issues](../user/edit-ticket.md#section_xwx_qpn_jz) to other queues.

{% endnote %}

To permanently delete a queue and all the issues in it:

1. Open the [queue page](../user/queue.md).

1. To the left of the queue name, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Administration**.

1. Go to the **Basic settings** tab.

1. Click **Delete queue**.

1. Confirm the deletion.

{% note tip %}

- To just remove a queue from the **Queues** menu on the top panel in {{ tracker-name }}, open the menu and click ![](../../_assets/tracker/remove-task-type.png).
- Instead of deleting a queue, you can [close access to it](queue-access.md#section_bvq_dc3_3z) for everyone except the owner. Issues in the closed queue won&apos;t be visible to other users, but they can be easily restored.
