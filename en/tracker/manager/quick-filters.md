# Finding issues in queues

By default, the [queue page](../user/queue.md) displays all the issues included in the queue. To search for issues in the list, use [filtering by parameters](#section_y5w_chh_11b) or the [filter builder](#section_kfq_2hh_11b). You can save the resulting issue list as a file if needed.

## Filtering by parameters {#section_y5w_chh_11b}

You can use filtering by parameters to filter and sort issues in a couple of clicks. The filter by parameters buttons are above the issue list.

To filter issues by their [resolution](../manager/create-resolution.md), click **Resolution** and select relevant values from the list.


As a result, only the issues that meet all the selected filter criteria are shown in the list.

## Filter builder {#section_kfq_2hh_11b}

If filtering by parameters does not provide enough filtering options for you, use the filter builder. You can use the filter builder right on the queue page:

1. Go to the queue page.

1. Above the issue list, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/add-filter.svg) **Add a field for filtering** and select a field.

1. Set the value for the parameter.

## Displaying issue fields {#section_wbf_33h_11b}

Set up the fields visible to you in the issue list to see only those parameters that are important to you.

1. Go to the queue page.

1. Click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/list-settings.svg) **Settings** above the issue list, on the right.

1. Select the parameters that you want to see in the issue list.

1. Click **Apply**.

The changes are applied immediately: you don't need to refresh the page.


## Saving a list to file {#section_vjt_x3h_11b}

You can save an issue list to a file in one of the formats: XML, CSV, or XLSX.

{% note alert %}

The issue list is saved with allÂ the filters and field settings applied.

{% endnote %}

To save your issue list to a file:

1. In the upper-right corner, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/actions.svg) **Actions with queue**.

1. Then click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/icon-export-tasks.svg) **Export**.

1. Select the format for saving the list.

1. Wait until the file downloads to your device.
