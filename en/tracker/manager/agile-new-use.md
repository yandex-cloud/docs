# Working with an agile board in {{ tracker-name }}

You can add issues to your board from any of your queues. Issues are displayed on the board as cards with general issue parameters on them. A card's appearance can be [customized](agile-new-set.md).

{% if audience == "draft"%}
To open the board page, find the left-hand panel and choose ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/boards.svg)&nbsp;**Issue boards**. Then click the desired board.

{% note info %}

You can view the **Issue boards** section in the [beta version of the new interface {{ tracker-full-name }}](../user/personal.md#sec_beta).

{% endnote %}
{% endif %}

## Managing issues {#manage}

Managing issues on Tracker boards is similar to using stickers on a real board:

* Issue cards are arranged into columns based on their status. To change the issue status, just drag it to the corresponding column.

  {% note info %}

  You won't be able to move a card to the column if the queue [workflow](./workflow.md) doesn't support the new status.

  {% endnote %}

* To change a card's position in the column, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/actions.svg) in the card's upper-right corner and select **Move to top** or **Move to bottom**.

* To remove an issue from the board, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/actions.svg) in the card's upper-right corner and select **Remove from board**.

  {% note info %}

  If you remove an issue from the project board, it will also be removed from the [project's issue list](project-list.md).

  {% endnote %}

* If you want to change issue parameters or leave a comment, click the issue card and make your changes on the right-hand panel.

## Filtering issues {#filter}

If there are too many issues on the board, you can always hide some of them using filters. You can select one of the saved filters or create a new one. You can also apply multiple filters simultaneously.

To create a filter on the board:

1. In the upper-right corner, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/filter.svg)&nbsp;**Filters**. The filter settings panel will appear above the columns.

1. Click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/add-filter.svg). Select a parameter and set its value to filter issues.

   Your filter can contain multiple parameters if needed.

1. To remove a filter, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/clear-filter.svg)&nbsp;**Reset**.

1. To save a filter, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/save-filter.svg)&nbsp;**Save**:

   1. Enter a name for your filter.

   1. Select who will see the filter pinned at the top of the board for quick access: only you or all users. Pinned filters are displayed as buttons at the top of the board.

   1. Click **Save**.

   Saved filters can be accessed by all users.

1. You can pin your saved filters to the top of the board for quick access:

## Issue grouping {#group}

To group issues displayed on the board by a certain parameter, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/group.svg)&nbsp;**No grouping** at the top of the board and select a grouping parameter from the list. All issues that have the same value for the parameter will be grouped together.

## Create an issue {#create-task}

## Adding issues to boards {#add-task}

The issues you add to the board are displayed in columns that correspond to issue statuses. If the issues you've added are not displayed on the board, make sure you [linked their statuses to the columns](agile-new-set.md#cols). To view the list of statuses that are not used on the board, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/unused-status.svg) next to the rightmost column.

### Adding issues to project boards {#project}

When managing projects in the [beta version of the new interface {{ tracker-full-name }}](project-new.md), project issues are automatically displayed on the project's board.

* If you remove an issue from the issue board, it will be removed from the project as well.

## Adding notes to a board {#add-note}
