# Creating a resolution

{% note warning %}

Only your organization&apos;s admin can create new resolutions. Once created, a resolution can't be deleted or edited.

{% endnote %}

A resolution is an issue attribute that specifies why the issue was closed. For example, an issue can be closed because it was completed (the <q>Resolved</q> resolution status) or because it's a duplicate of another issue (the <q>Duplicate</q> status).

The most popular resolutions are available in {{ tracker-name }} by default. If you need something different, create a new one:

1. Make sure that you are logged in as an administrator in {{ tracker-full-name }}.

1. On the top panel in {{ tracker-name }}, choose ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) â†’ **Configure {{ tracker-name }}**.

1. Go to the **Resolutions** tab.

1. Click **Create resolution**.

1. Fill in the fields and click **Create**.
