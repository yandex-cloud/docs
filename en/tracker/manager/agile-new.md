# Issue boards

Issue boards are a tool that helps you track and manage your issues in a streamlined manner. There are two types of boards in {{ tracker-name }}:

- **Basic boards** can be used by any teams and allow arranging issues in columns based on their status. [Creating a basic board](agile-new-create.md#basic)

- Boards with a **Backlog and sprints** are good for Agile teams and allow managing [sprints](create-agile-sprint.md), [estimating issue complexity](poker.md), and analyzing [burn down charts](burndown-diagram.md). [Creating a board with a backlog and sprints](agile-new-create.md#backlog-and-sprints)

## How to work with boards {#tips}

The number of issues on boards is limited, so we recommend that you follow these guidelines:

* Only add issues to a board that you plan to complete in the near future (such as in the next six months).
* To avoid overloading issue boards, configure [automatic issue removal](agile-new-set-board.md#autodelete) so that issues in a specific status are removed from the board automatically.
* To analyze closed issues that have been removed from the board, use the [search issues]({{ link-tracker }}issues) page or, if you are using a board with a **Backlog and sprints**, you will see a link to a filter with a completed sprint's issues in the **Backlog** tab.
* To work with all of your issues (for example, to perform their general analysis through filtering or sorting), use queues: do not try to add all the issues to one board.
