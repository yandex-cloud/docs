You can use Yandex.Forms to set up your form to act as a template for creating issues as well as integrate it with the {{ tracker-name }} interface. Such form will be displayed on the issue creation page next to the basic one. It will help users create issues by following a preset template without feeling distracted by other fields and parameters.

## Step 1. Create and configure your form {#section_ovd_5hl_1gb}

1. {% if audience == "external" %} Go to [Yandex.Forms]({{ link-forms }}). If it isn't activated, contact your organization's administration.{% else %}Go to [Yandex.Forms]({{ link-forms }}).{% endif %}

   Set up your form's fields to collect data needed for issue creation.

1. Configure the name of the form. This name will be displayed in the {{ tracker-name }} interface during issue creation.

2. Set up [{{ tracker-name }} integration]{% if audience == "external" %}{% if locale == "ru" %}(https://yandex.ru/support/connect-forms/common/create-task.html){% else %}(https://yandex.com/support/connect-forms/common/notifications.html#notifications__section_rvr_4jc_tbb){% endif %}{% else %}(https://doc.yandex-team.ru/forms/external/create-task.html){% endif %} for your form.
