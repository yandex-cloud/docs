# Switching a board to our new technologies

Switching boards to [our new technologies](agile-new.md) allows you to add new features for effective issue planning:

* Speed. You will no longer need to reload the page after each change: everything will display on the board immediately.
* Sorting issues by any parameter.
* Mass editing of issues.
* Updated backlog and poker planning.
* Creating any columns with no link to the issue status.
* Flexible configuration of issue cards on the board.

## Migration process {#about-migration}

When migrating the board, the following is retained:

* ID
* Name
* Issues added

* Status distribution by column
* <q>Reported by me</q> and <q>Assigned to me</q> filters
* Filter for adding issues

The board type is also retained during migration: **basic** and **Kanban** (have the same functionality) boards are converted into basic boards, while **Scrum** boards become boards with a backlog and sprints.

When migrating the board, the following is not retained:

* Filters with criteria written in the query language. They are not yet supported in the new board version. Therefore, you will need to recreate filters after migrating the board and formulate their criteria using parameters.

   {% note warning %}

   If you are using a filter like this with criteria written in the query language to add issues to your board, you will not be able to migrate the board until you replace the filter with a similar one that uses parameter-based criteria.

   {% endnote %}

* The ability to store over 2,000 issues, since the new board version has a limit on the number of issues. If your board contains more than 2,000 issues, it cannot be migrated. To avoid overflow on new boards, you can set up a filter to automatically remove issues from the board.

## Migration steps {#how-to-migrate}

{% note info %}

If you don't see the **Switch to our new technologies** button in your board's top panel, it means that your board has already been switched to these technologies.

{% endnote %}

To perform migration:

1. In your board's top panel, click **Switch to our new technologies**. Your board is verified for whether it can be migrated and the migration window opens.

1. Review the migration window:
   * If there are errors, follow the recommendations on how to fix them and try again.
   * If there are no errors, click **Start switching**. This may take a few minutes.

## Switching back to the old board version {#backward}

If, after switching to our new technologies, you decide that they do not suit you, you can roll your board back to its original view. To do this, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/actions.svg) â†’ **Switch back to the old version** in the board's top panel and wait until it switches back.

{% note warning %}

If you enable a backlog on your **basic** board after migration, it will be converted into a **Scrum** board.
