# Burn down chart

{% note warning %}

You can only use burn down charts for **Scrum** boards.

{% endnote %}

A burn down chart shows the issue completion rate and the remaining amount of work within a single [sprint](agile.md#dlen_sprint). Burn down charts are useful for evaluating whether the team will be able to solve the planned issues in time.

The chart's vertical axis shows the total workload left in [Story Points](agile.md#dlen_sp), while the horizontal axis shows time. The ideal burndown chart should be as close as possible to a straight line that starts at the point with the most amount of work during the first day (total workload volume within a sprint) and ends at the zero point during the last day of the sprint.

To view the chart:

1. Choose a board from the **Boards** menu on the top panel.

1. Go to the **Burn down chart** tab.

1. Select a sprint you want to place on the chart from the drop-down list.
