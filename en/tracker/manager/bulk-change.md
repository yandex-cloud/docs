# Changing multiple issues

You can change statuses and fields for multiple issues at once. To open your issue list, go to the queue or filter page.

## Changing the status {#section_kkf_tjr_fgb}

To change the status of issues on the queue or filter pages, do the following:

1. Check the box ![](../../_assets/tracker/bulk-checkmark.png) next to the issues you want to change.

   If you want to select all the issues on the queue or filter page at once, check the box ![](../../_assets/tracker/bulk-checkmark.png) at the top of the issue list.

1. Click **Change status** on the bottom panel.

1. Select the action to trigger the status change. Only status transitions that are included in the [workflow](workflow.md) are available for bulk change. If you select a status transition that is only available for some of the issues, only those issues will change their status. The number of issues you can change statuses of is displayed to the right of the status name.
