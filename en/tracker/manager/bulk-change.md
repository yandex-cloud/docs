# Change multiple issues

You can change statuses and fields for multiple issues at once. To open your issue list, go to the queue or filter page.

## Change status{#section_kkf_tjr_fgb}

To change the status of issues on the queue or filter pages, do the following:

1. Label the issues you want to change with ![](../../_assets/tracker/bulk-checkmark.png).

   If you want to select all issues on the queue or filter page at once, use the ![](../../_assets/tracker/bulk-checkmark.png) label above the issue list.

1. Click **Change status** on the bottom panel.

1. Select the action to trigger the status change. Only the status transitions that are included in the [workflow](workflow.md) are available for bulk change. If you select a status transition that is only available for some of the issues, only those issues will change their status. The number of issues you can change statuses of is displayed to the right of the status name.

1. Followers don't receive any notifications about bulk changes to issues by default. If you want to notify them, turn on the option **Send notification to followers**.

1. Click **Continue**.

1. Wait for the issues to be processed and click **Finish**.
