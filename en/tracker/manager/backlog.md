# Backlog

A backlog is a list of issues or product requirements to be completed. Backlog issues are usually sorted by priority.

{% note warning %}

You can only use a backlog on **Scrum** boards or [new boards](agile-new.md).

{% endnote %}

## Backlog on new issue boards {#new-backlog}

On [new boards](agile-new.md), you can enable a separate tab for a backlog. The **Backlog** tab consists of two parts:

* Backlog issues.
* Sprints.

You can use the **Backlog** tab to store your team's critical issues, sort them by priority, and distribute them across sprints. You can create new issues or add existing ones to both the backlog and directly to a sprint. To move an issue from the backlog to a sprint, just drag its card from one list to another.

Track an issue's validity in the backlog: it shouldn't contain closed issues, duplicate issues, or issues that work can't be started on in the near future.

{% note warning %}

A separate **Backlog** tab is enabled right on the issue board. Currently, you can't disable the **Backlog** tab and sprints. We'll add this feature later.

{% endnote %}

To enable a backlog and sprints on new standard boards:
1. Click **Enable backlog** at the top of the screen.
1. If the issue board already contains issues, select where to move them: to the backlog or sprint.

This opens the **Backlog** tab with a list of backlog issues and sprints.

## How to add issues to the backlog on new boards {##add-new-backlog}

To add a single issue:
1. Decide where to add an issue (to the backlog or sprint) and click **+ Add issue** in the appropriate section.
1. Select an existing issue or create a new one right on the board. You can add or create an issue from any queue that you have access to.

To add a group of issues, for instance, all issues from a queue with a certain assignee, import issues:
1. Click **Import issues** at the top of the screen.
1. Select where to place them: the backlog or sprint.
1. Click **+ Add parameters** and specify an issue selection criterion. Click **Import**. You'll see the issues in the **Backlog** tab either among the backlog issues or in the sprint.
