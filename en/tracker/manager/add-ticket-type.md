# Configuring issue types

{% note warning %}

By default, [only the queue owner](queue-access.md) can configure a queue.

{% endnote %}

A queue may include different types of issues, such as <q>New feature</q>, <q>Improvement</q>, or <q>Bug</q>. Each type of issue has its own workflow and set of resolutions. You can change the parameters of the available types of issues in the queue settings.
