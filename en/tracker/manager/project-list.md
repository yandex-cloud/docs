# List of project issues

On the **Issue list** tab, you can see all the issues [added](create-project.md#add-tickets) to the project. The list shows the structure of your project: you can build your work hierarchy as a tree of sub-issues, range your issues manually, or sort them by one of the fields.

To open the list of project issues

1. In the left panel, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/project.svg)&nbsp;**Projects** or follow the [direct link]({{ link-tracker }}pages/projects) and open the project page.

1. Click the **Issue lists** tab.
