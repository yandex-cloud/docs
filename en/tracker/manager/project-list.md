# List of project issues

The **Issue list** tab displays all issues [added](create-project.md#add-tickets) to the project. The list is composed in a way that reflects your project's structure. You can display your tasks as a sub-issue tree, place issues manually, or sort them by one of the fields.

To open a project's issue list:

1. Select a project on the left-hand panel in the ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/project.svg)&nbsp;**Projects** section.

   {% note info %}

   You can view the **Projects** section in the new interface {{ tracker-name }}. To learn about switching to the new interface, see [{#T}](project-new.md).

   {% endnote %}

1. Go to the **Issue list** tab.

1. Configure list display:

    * To select fields to display in the issue list, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/settings.svg). Select the desired fields and click **Apply**.

    * To search for issues in the list, enter the issue name or key in the **Issue search** field.

    * To change the layout of your issue list, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/flat-list.svg)&nbsp;**Flat view** or ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/tree-list.svg)&nbsp;**Tree view**.

      * The tree view mode allows you to create new sub-issues and change their links. To edit an issue link, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/range.svg) to the left of the sub-issue and drag it to the issue you wish to assign the parent status to.

        {% note info %}

        In tree view mode, the issue hierarchy reflects their [links](../user/links.md) of the <q>Parent issue â€” Sub-issue</q> type.

        {% endnote %}

      * The flat view mode allows you to rank (move) issues relative to one another. To do this, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/range.svg) to the left of the issue and move it to the desired position.

    * To group issues by status, assignee, or other parameters, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/group.svg) and select the desired option from the list that appears.

    * To filter your issue list, use the quick filter builder. To do this, find the ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/filters.svg)&nbsp;**Filters** panel, select the parameters, and specify the values to form the list of issues.

    * To filter your list in ascending or descending order of column values, click the column name.
