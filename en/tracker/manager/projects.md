# Projects

In {{ tracker-name }}, projects are sets of issues that have a common goal. Projects come in various forms, from creating a new app or service to holding a conference or renovating the office. Any activity with deadlines and set goals in mind can be thought of as a project.

Projects can include issues from different queues. You can use projects to group together issues managed by different teams as long as they share a goal.

To start working on a project in {{ tracker-name }}, create a new project and add issues. You can appoint a project owner and set deadlines and project statuses. There is a dedicated page for tracking progress on all projects.

## Creating a project {#section_htn_4ly_tgb}

    {% note info %}

    If you don't see the Projects tab, ask the queue owner to enable the **Show "Projects" tab** option.

    {% endnote %}

1. Set your project's settings:

    - **Name**. Try keeping it short and simple so it's easier to work with.

    - **Project status**: The current stage of the project.
