# Issue board

Each project in {{ tracker-name }} has an issue board of the <q>Basic</q> type. Basic boards allow you to arrange issues in columns based on their status; however, they do not support [Agile methodologies](../glossary.md#rus-g), such as Scrum and Kanban.

To go to a project issue board:

1. In the left panel under ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/project.svg)&nbsp;**Projects**, select a project.

1. Go to the **Issue board** tab.

{% note info %}

You can also open the project issue board in the ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/boards.svg) **Boards** section in the left panel. By default, this dashboard is named <q>`<Project name>` project dashboard</q>.

{% endnote %}

## Creating a project board {#create-board}

A project issue board is automatically created when you create a project. If there is no project issue board, e.g., it was [deleted](#delete-board) manually), you can create one:

1. In the top right corner of the project page, click ![](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) **Project menu**.

1. Select **Create project board**.

For more information about all operations you can perform, see [{#T}](./agile-new-use.md) and [{#T}](./agile-new-set.md).

## Adding issues to a board {#add-tickets}

All project issues are automatically shown on the board linked to this project. There are various methods to add issues to the board:

* [Adding issues to a project board](./agile-new-use.md#add-task).

* [Adding issues to a project](./create-project.md#add-tickets).

{% note info %}

If you add an issue to the project board, it's automatically added to the project. If you delete an issue from the project board, the issue is also deleted from the project.

{% endnote %}

## Deleting a board {#delete-board}

To delete a project board:

1. In the top right corner of the project page, click ![](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) **Project menu**.

1. Select **Delete project board**.
