# Macros

In {{ tracker-name }}, macros are scripted algorithms that can be executed on the issue page. You can use macros to automate repeating actions. Macros let you change issue fields, create automated comments{% if audience == "internal" %}, and send messages{% endif %} in just one click.

## Creating a macro {#section_inq_5b1_x2b}

{% note warning %}

By default, [only the queue owner](queue-access.md) can configure a queue.

{% endnote %}

Each {{ tracker-name }} queue has its own set of macros. To create a new queue macro, do the following:

1. Open the [queue page](../user/queue.md).

1. To the left of the queue name, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Configure**.

1. On the left-hand panel, select **Automation** → **Macros** and click **Create macro**.

1. Set up your macro parameters:
    - **Macro name**.
    - **Message**: Message body (comment{% if audience == "internal" %} or email{% endif %}) created when executing a macro. If you don't want your macro to create any messages, leave this field empty.
You can insert [issue field values into your messages](../user/vars.md). To do this, click **Add variable** and select one or more values. The **Message** field will show a sequence like `not_var{{issue.fieldKey}}`.
    - **Actions**: Choose issue fields a macro should change and specify their values after the change.

1. Click **Create macro**.

## Edit and delete macros {#section_swl_sdb_x2b}

{% note warning %}

By default, [only the queue owner](queue-access.md) can configure a queue.

{% endnote %}

1. Open the [queue page](../user/queue.md).

1. To the left of the queue name, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Configure**.

1. On the left-hand panel, select **Automation** → **Macros** and hover over the macro you need.

1. To edit the macro, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-edit.png).
To delete a macro, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-delete.png).

## Running a macro {#section_ekq_22b_x2b}

Macros let you change issue fields, create automated comments{% if audience == "internal" %}, and send messages{% endif %}. Any user with access rights to issue editing can execute macros.

To run a macro:

1. Open the issue page.

1. Go to the comment field.

1. Select a macro from the **Macros** drop-down list.
You can select multiple macros at the same time. If multiple macros change the same field, only the last executed change will be applied.

{% if audience == "internal" %}

1. To send a message using a macro, go to the **Message** tab and [configure its fields](../user/comments.md#send-comment).

{% endif %}

1. To execute the macro, click **Submit**.

## Example of a macro {#macro_example}

{% if audience == "internal" %}

### Closing an issue and notifying the user {#macro_example_close_task}

Let's say the support team is processing user requests in {{ tracker-name }}. After the request is processed, the issue must be closed and the requester must be notified that their request has been resolved. Let's set up a macro that's going to do exactly that:

1. Choose the queue you want to create the macro for and open the settings.

1. In the **Macros** section, click [**Create macro**](#section_inq_5b1_x2b).

1. Set the macro name.

1. Write the email. You can add issue fields to your message by clicking **Add variable**.

1. If you want your macro to close issues, go to **Actions** and choose **Status** → **Set value** → **Closed**.

1. Save your macro.

To run a macro you created:

1. Open any issue from the queue you made the macro in.

1. Click **Macros** in the comment box and choose a name for your macro.

1. Turn on the **Email** option above the comment box and specify the recipient's address. If the issue was [generated from a user email](../user/create-ticket-by-mail.md), the requester's email address will be automatically added to the **To** field.

1. Click **Submit**. The user will receive an email and the issue status will be updated to **Closed**.
{% endif %}

{% if audience == "internal" %}

### Transferring an issue to the second support line {#macro_example_shift_line}

{% endif %}
Let's say a member of the first line of support wants to transfer a user request in {{ tracker-name }} to the second line of support. We'll set up a macro that does exactly that:

1. Choose the queue where you want to create the macro for switching the request to a different support line and open its settings.

1. In the **Macros** section, click [**Create macro**](#section_inq_5b1_x2b).

1. Set the macro name.

1. Write the text to add to the issue comment. You can add issue fields by clicking **Add variable**.

1. If you want your macro to assign an issue to a specific employee in the second support line, find the **Actions** section, choose **System** → **Assignee**, and specify the employee's name.

1. If you want your macro to change the issue status, go to **Actions**, choose **System** → **Status**, and set it to **Support line 2**.
If the desired status is not in the list of values, [set up a workflow](add-workflow.md).

1. Save your macro.

To run a macro you created:

1. Open any issue from the queue you made the macro in.

1. Click **Macros** in the comment box and choose a name for your macro.

1. Your text is automatically added to the comment. If necessary, edit it.

1. Click **Submit**. The issue will be transferred to the second support line.
