# Changing basic queue settings

{% note warning %}

By default, [only the queue owner](queue-access.md) can configure a queue.

{% endnote %}

To configure the main queue settings:

1. Open the [queue page](../user/queue.md).

1. To the left of the queue name, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) â†’ **Administration**.

1. Go to **Basic settings**

1. Configure queue settings.

    - Basic settings:
        - **Queue name**.
        - **Queue description**. The description is displayed on the queue page on the **Description** tab.
        - **Default priority of issues**.
        - **Voting in issues**: Allows or prohibits users from [voting for issues](../user/votes.md) in the queue.

    - In **Advanced settings**:
        - **Required fields for the queue**: Issue fields that are always displayed on the issue page, regardless of [user settings](../user/edit-ticket.md#section_jqw_ppn_jz).
        - **Fields in notifications**: Issue fields that are displayed in all notifications relating to queue issues.

        {% if audience == "internal" %}

        - **Status after adding external link**: Status that queue issues are automatically switched to when creating a link to commits or pull requests on Crucible, Review Board, Stash, or GitHub. Possible issue statuses are set in the [workflow](workflow.md) settings.

        - **Sending emails**: Allows users to [send emails](../user/comments.md#section_zpd_ph5_wdb) to any address directly from the issue page. The message text is attached to the issue as a comment.

        - **Add the issue number in the subject line**: Indicates issue keys in the subject field for [emails sent from the issue page](../user/comments.md#section_zpd_ph5_wdb).

        {% endif %}
        - **Don't link to issues in other queues automatically**: Issue linking doesn't trigger when an issue key from another queue is embedded in a comment or issue description.

    - In **Integration settings**: {#integration}
        - **Show "Commits" tab**: Show or hide the **Commits** tab on the queue and issue pages. The tab displays all [commits linked to your issue](../user/edit-ticket.md#sec_commit).

        {% if audience == "internal" %}
        - **Display "Goals" tab**: Show or hide the [Goals](goals.md) tab on the queue page. This tab shows a list of goals associated with issues in the queue.

        {% endif %}
        - **Show "Projects" tab**: Show or hide the [Projects](projects.md) tab on the queue page.

        {% if audience == "internal" %}
        - **Show "OEBS Transactions" tab**: Show or hide the **OEBS Transactions** tab on the queue page. This tab shows a list of transactions associated with issues in the queue.
        - **Display link to service**: If the options are enabled, the issue page will show sections with issue links to external services.
        - **Disable automatic linking with Conductor**: By default, {{ tracker-name }} automatically links an issue to a ticket in Conductor if the issue key is specified in ticket comments.

        {% endif %}

1. Click **Save**.
