# Advanced queue features

You can use advanced queue features to manage your issues more effectively and create your own workflow. These features include automatic changes to issue fields, {% if audience == "internal" %}mailbox integration, {% endif %}notifications, and so on.

You can:

- Automate certain recurring actions within queues, such as changing values in issue fields or sending preset comments. To do this, create [triggers](../user/trigger.md), [auto actions](../user/autoactions.md), and [macros](create-macroses.md).

- [Set up the queue email address](queue-mail.md) to create issues from incoming email and respond to user emails right from the issue page. This helps log and process user requests, such as those sent to support.

- [Embed a {{ forms-full-name }} form](attach-form.md) on the issue creation page to use it as a template for filling in your issue fields.

- [Subscribe users to notifications](subscriptions.md) about changes to all issues in the queue or issues related to specific components and versions.

- [Configure components](components.md) to group issues in the queue by product components or other shared parameters.

- [Configure versions](versions.md) to select product versions related to issues in the queue.

- [Create and edit projects](projects.md): groups of issues that can have their own managers and deadlines. Projects let you group issues by a shared goal, even if those issues are handled by different teams across multiple queues.

- [Configure an SLA](../sla-head.md) to monitor how quickly issues in a queue are resolved. This is useful when you need to respond to user requests within a certain period of time, such as requests to support.
