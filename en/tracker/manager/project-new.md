# Projects (beta version)

A project is any activity with set goals and deadlines.

In {{ tracker-name }}, projects are sets of issues that have a common goal. Projects are not linked to a specific issue queue, so you can use them to group together issues managed by different teams as long as they share a goal.

The [beta version of the new interface {{ tracker-full-name }}](../user/personal.md#sec_beta) includes an expanded set of features for working with projects, such as project issue lists and improved Gantt charts.

## Getting started {#quick-start}

To start working on a project in {{ tracker-name }}, [create](create-project.md) a new project and add issues to it. Projects can include issues from different queues.

You can plan out your workload and manage deadlines using a [Gantt chart](gantt-project.md).

## Project page {#page}

In the new {{ tracker-name }} interface, you can open all available projects right from the navigation panel on the left: click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/project.svg)&nbsp;**Projects** and select a project from the list.

The project page lists all information about the project's team, goals, and issues.

* **About the project**: Includes the project's description, status, deadlines, reporter, responsible employee, and a list of team members.

* **Issue list**: Displays both open and closed issues. You can also apply filters to the issues. For more information, see [{#T}](project-list.md).

* **Gantt chart**: A calendar schedule for resolving project issues. The Gantt chart displays issue deadlines and issue links. For more information, see [{#T}](gantt-project.md).

* **Issue board**: A virtual board with issue cards that allow you to keep track of issue statuses in a convenient way. To learn about managing issue boards, see [{#T}](agile-new-use.md).

  The project board is also displayed on the ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/boards.svg)&nbsp;**Issue board** on the left-hand panel.

You can keep track of your project's progress by checking the indicator bar in the upper-right corner of the project page.  The progress bar gets filled as more issues are completed.
