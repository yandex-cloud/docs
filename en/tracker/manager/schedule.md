# Work schedules

{% note warning %}

By default, [only the queue owner](queue-access.md) can configure a queue.

{% endnote %}

Work schedules allow you to set up the timeframe for when [the SLA rule](sla.md) applies. The SLA timer will not work during non-work hours. You can select one of the pre-set schedules for the rule or create your own.
