# Versions

Typically, versions are used for software development tasks. They help you group issues that are related to the same version of a product. Version values can be configured on the queue page.

To assign a version to an issue, fill in the field **Affected Version** or **Fix Version** on the issue page.

The **Affected Version** field indicates the version of a product or package with the bug.

The **Fix Version** field is used for planning your work. This field is used to sort issues by product version or release.
