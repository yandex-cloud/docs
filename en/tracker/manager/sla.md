# Configuring rules

{% note warning %}

By default, [only the queue owner](queue-access.md) can configure a queue.

{% endnote %}

## Creating a rule {#create-rule}

The rule will be applied to all the new issues in the queue. The SLA timer won't appear in the issues created earlier than the rule.

To create a new SLA rule:

1. {% include [go to settings](../../_includes/tracker/transition-page.md) %}

1. In the upper-right corner, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/queue-settings.svg) **Queue settings**.

1. Go to the **SLA** tab.

1. Click **Create rule**.

1. Click the ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-edit.png
   ) icon and name the rule.

1. Select a [work schedule](schedule.md). The schedule sets the time when the rule is active. The timer won't count outside your working hours.

1. You can't use filters to select the issues that the rule will be applied to. The <q>All queue issues</q> filter is enabled by default.

   * To add a filter of issues, click **Create a new filter** and set the criteria for selecting issues.

   * To change an existing filter, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-edit.png
      ).

   * To delete the filter, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-delete.png).

   You can set up multiple filters per rule.

1. For each group, set the timeframe for completing issues in `00h 00m` format:

   * **Time until warning** (optional): When this time expires, {{ tracker-name }} sends a warning that the time to process the issue is running out.

   * **Time until expiration**: The time limit for processing the issue. At the end of this time, {{ tracker-name }} sends out a notification saying that the time is up.

1. Set the conditions on which the timer will start, pause, or stop.

   * **Start**: The timer starts if any of the listed conditions are met. If the timer was on pause, the time count will resume.

   * **Pause**: The timer pauses if any of the listed conditions is met. The timer will start when a condition from the **Start** list is met.

      {% note alert %}

      If the pause condition is set to "Issue has the status", the timer will start as soon as the issue is switched to any other status.

      {% endnote %}

   * **Stop**: The timer stops if any of the listed conditions is met.

   Possible conditions:
   Condition | Timer mode | Description
   ----- | ----- | -----
   Assignee deleted | **Start**, **Stop** | The condition is met when the issue assignee is removed.  
   Assignee set | **Start**, **Stop** | The condition is met when a new assignee is set for the issue.
   Customer answer received | **Start**, **Stop** | The condition is met when the issue is commented on by a user who is not a member of the [queue team](queue-team.md).

   Issue created | **Start** | The timer will start immediately after the issue is created.
   Issue status changed to | **Start**, **Stop** | The condition is met when the issue is switched to one of the specified statuses.

   Resolution deleted | **Start** | The condition is met when a previously set resolution is removed from the issue.

   Issue has the status | **Pause** | The timer will be paused while the issue is in one of the specified statuses. After the status changes, the timer will start automatically.

   Resolution set | **Stop** | The condition is met when one of the resolutions in the issue is set.

   Received response from queue team | **Stop** | The condition is met when the issue is commented on by a user who is on the [queue team](queue-team.md).
   Issue has an assignee | **Pause** | The timer will be paused while the issue has an assignee set. Once the assignee is deleted, the timer will start automatically.
   Issue has no assignee | **Pause** | The timer will be paused while the issue has no assignee set. Once the assignee is set, the timer will start automatically.

1. You can configure the timer to reset if the start conditions are met. To do this, select **Restart the timer each time start conditions are triggered** under **Restart**. In this case, instead of resuming the time count, it will restart after the pause.

1. In the **Notifications** section, specify how and whom to notify about overdue issues.

1. Click **Save**.

### Example {#example}

Let's create a rule to control the response time to new issues. The timer of the rule will start as soon as the issue is assigned and paused as soon as the assignee starts working on the issue. If the assignee doesn't respond to the issue within 15 minutes, you'll get notified by email.

To create a rule:

1. Under **Timeframes for issues**, set the maximum response time for an issue:
   * Leave the **Time until warning** field blank.

   * In the **Time until expiration** field, enter the maximum response time, for example, `15m`.

1. Set up a timer:
   * **Start**: Assignee set.

   * **Stop**: The issue is switched to the <q>In progress</q> status.

   * Leave the **Pause** section empty.

1. Set up a notification about overdue deadlines.
   * **Method**: Email.

   * **Recipients** — Your username in Yandex Tracker.
