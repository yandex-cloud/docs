# Setting up statuses

{% note warning %}

By default, [only the queue owner](queue-access.md) can configure a queue.

{% endnote %}

You can configure a set of available statuses for each workflow. You can assign such statuses to the issues that your workflow is applied to.

## Creating a status {#create-status}

{% note warning %}

Only an [administrator](../role-model.md) can create new issue statuses. Once you have created a status, you can't delete or edit it.

{% endnote %}

A status is an issue attribute that reflects the current state of the issue completion process. For example: <q>Open</q>, <q>In progress</q>, <q>Testing</q>, and <q>Closed</q>.

The most popular issue statuses are available in {{ tracker-name }} by default. If there is no matching status among them, create a new status.

1. Make sure you are authorized in {{ tracker-full-name }} as an [administrator](../role-model.md).

1. On the right-hand panel, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/admin.svg) **Administration** â†’ **{{ tracker-name }} setting** .

1. Go to the **Issue statuses** tab.

1. Click **Create status**.

1. Fill in the fields and click **Create**.

{% endif %}

   | **Transition button name in Russian** | The name of the button in the English {{ tracker-name }} interface that will switch the issue to this status. |

   {% if audience == "external" %}

   The most popular statuses are available in {{ tracker-name }} by default. If you don't see the status you need, admin can [create one](#create-status).

   {% else %}
