## Creating a status {#create-status}

{% note warning %}

Only the company admin can create new issue statuses. The created status can't be deleted or edited.

{% endnote %}

A status is an issue attribute that reflects the current state of the issue completion process. For example: <q>Open</q>, <q>In progress</q>, <q>Testing</q>, and <q>Closed</q>.

The most popular issue statuses are available in {{ tracker-name }} by default. If you need something different, create a new one:

1. Make sure that you are logged in as an administrator in {{ tracker-full-name }}.

1. On the {{ tracker-name }} top panel, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) â†’ **Configure {{ tracker-name }}**.

1. Go to the **Issue statuses** tab.

1. Click **Create status**.

1. Fill in the fields and click **Create**.

{% endif %}

    | **Transition button name in Russian** | The name of the button in the English {{ tracker-name }} interface that will switch the issue to this status. |

   {% if audience == "external" %}

   The most popular statuses are available in {{ tracker-name }} by default. If you don't see the status you need, your company's admin can [create one](#create-status).
