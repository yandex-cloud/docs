# Workflow templates

Workflow templates may come in handy in case you do not know yet how to customize {{ tracker-name }} for your domain. We have multiple workflow options for you to choose from:

* Project management: Good for multiple teams working on the same project. This workflow provides all you need for planning and issue estimation.
* Development: Great template for a development team actively using Agile development methodologies. We will set up dashboards with a backlog and sprints for you.
* Support: We will provide tools for trouble ticket collection, as well as response templates and auto responses, while issue SLA timers will help you monitor the time it takes to handle messages.
* Basic template: Great choice for new {{ tracker-name }} users. You can then transform it into a really convenient workflow that suits your needs.

Choose the template that works for you and we will create all required entities in {{ tracker-name }}.
