# Setting up a billing account

You need a {{ yandex-cloud }} billing account to pay your invoices for using {{ tracker-name }} if [full access](access.md) to the platform is granted to six or more users. Payments for the service are automatically debited from the billing account linked to {{ tracker-name }} on the first day of every month. To learn more about service plans and take a look at some examples of how to calculate monthly costs, see [Pricing policy](pricing.md).

You can find the FAQ for payments in [{#T}](payment.md).

## Linking a billing account to {{ tracker-name }} {#bind}

If you want to use paid features in {{ tracker-name }}, you first need to link a billing account. To do this, [follow the link]({{ link-bind-ba }}).

A window that prompts you to link your billing account to {{ tracker-name }} appears when you [grant full access](access.md#set) to a new user (if five of your employees already have full access) or when enabling [automatic full access](access.md#access-new-users) for all new users.

* If you already have a {{ yandex-cloud }} billing account, select it from the list and click **Link**.

* If you don't have a billing account yet, select **Create** and [add a new account](#create).

{% note warning %}

If the selected billing account has overdue payments or has been suspended, you won't be able to link it to {{ tracker-name }}. If this is the case, please go to the [{{ link-billing }}]({{ link-billing }}) page, select your account, and follow the prompts in the interface. After your billing account is re-activated, try linking it to {{ tracker-name }} again. You can read more about account statuses in the [{{ yandex-cloud }} billing](../billing/concepts/billing-account-statuses.md) documentation.

If you linked a billing account with an active trial period or created a new account, the paid version will be automatically activated for your account.

If you haven't used the starting grant yet, you will be able to use it after switching to the paid version.
