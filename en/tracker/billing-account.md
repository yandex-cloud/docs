# Setting up a billing account

You need a {{ yandex-cloud }} billing account to pay your invoices for using {{ tracker-name }} if [full access](access.md)  to the platform is granted to six or more users. To learn more about service plans and take a look at some examples of how to calculate monthly costs, see [Pricing policy](pricing.md).

## Linking a billing account to {{ tracker-name }} {#bind}

To use {{ tracker-name }} paid features, you first need to link a billing account. A window that prompts you to link your billing account to {{ tracker-name }} appears when [granting full access](access.md#set) to a new user (if five of your employees already have full access) or when enabling [automatic full access](access.md#access-new-users) for all new users.

* If you already have a {{ yandex-cloud }} billing account, select it from the list and click **Link**.

* If you don't have a billing account yet, select **Create** and [add a new account](#create).

{% note warning %}

If the selected billing account has overdue payments or has been suspended, you won't be able to link it to {{ tracker-name }}. If this is the case, please go to the [{{ link-billing }}]({{ link-billing }}) page, select your account, and follow the prompts in the interface. After your billing account is re-activated, try linking it to {{ tracker-name }} again. You can read more about account statuses in the [{{ yandex-cloud }} billing](../billing/concepts/billing-account-statuses.md) documentation.

{% endnote %}

If you linked a billing account with an active trial period or created a new account, the paid version will be automatically activated for your account. This means that money can be debited from your account to pay for services {{ yandex-cloud }}. If you haven't used the starting grant yet, you will be able to use it after switching to the paid version. Read more about the starting grant in [Getting started in {{ yandex-cloud }}](../getting-started/index.yaml).
