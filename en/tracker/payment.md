## Payments {#billing}

The billing period in {{ tracker-full-name }} is one calendar month. On the second day of each month, you'll be charged for the services used during the previous month.

{% note alert %}

The payment amount is automatically debited from your company's account. We recommend topping up your account in advance.

{% endnote %}

If there is not enough money on your account on the payment date, you may have a negative balance and enter into arrears. If the account balance is negative at the end of the month, all users from your company will be switched to [<q>Read only</q>](enable-tracker.md#readonly) mode.

To restore full access to {{ tracker-name }}, top up your account so that its balance is positive.

#### Topping up your account
