# Creating a queue for the support team



1. If your organization doesn't have {{ tracker-name }} yet, [activate it](enable-tracker.md).

1. [Add users to {{ tracker-name }}](add-users.md).


1. [Create a queue](manager/create-queue.md) using the <q>Basic support</q> or <q>Multi-tiered support</q> template.

    These [templates](manager/workflows.md) already include preset issue types and statuses that can be helpful for managing user requests. The <q>Multi-tiered support</q> template includes issue statuses like <q>Support line 1</q> and <q>Support line 2</q>.

1. Add your support staff to the [queue team](manager/queue-team.md).

1. You can also configure [access rights to issues within the queue](manager/queue-access.md) if needed. For example, you can allow certain users to create or view issues in the queue or prevent them from doing so.
