# Activating {{ tracker-full-name }}

If you aren't using {{ tracker-full-name }} to manage issues in your company, you can connect it. To work in {{ tracker-name }}, you'll need a [{{ yandex-cloud }} organization](../organization/). If you already have an organization, connect {{ tracker-name }} to it. If you have no organization, you can create it when connecting {{ tracker-name }}.

{% note warning %}

Only the users that have an account on Yandex can connect {{ tracker-name }}.

If the administrator of your organization already connected {{ tracker-name }}, to start working with issues, [log in to the service](user/login.md).

{% endnote %}

1. Log in to your [Yandex account]({{ link-passport }}). If you do not have an account, [create]({{ support-passport-create }}) one.

1. Go to the [page{{ tracker-name }}]({{ link-tracker-promo }}) and click **Try for free**.

1. If you are an administrator in one or more {{ yandex-cloud }} organizations, select the organization for which you want to connect {{ tracker-name }}, then click **Log in**.

   If you don't have a {{ yandex-cloud }} organization or want to create a new one, enter the name of the organization, add its description, then click **Create**.

   {{ tracker-full-name }} will be connected for the selected or created organization automatically. For more information about managing organizations, see the [{{ org-full-name }}](../organization/) documentation.
