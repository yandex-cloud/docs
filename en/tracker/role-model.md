# Roles and access rights in {{ tracker-name }}

{{ tracker-full-name }} is one of the [services](../organization/manage-services.md) you can connect to your company {{ yandex-cloud }}. The organization's admin who enabled {{ tracker-name }} also becomes [the admin of {{ tracker-name }}](#admin).

{% note info %}

If a user creates a new company when [activating {{ tracker-name }}](enable-tracker.md), they become the organization's owner and admin in {{ tracker-name }}.

{% endnote %}

The admin can add other users to {{ tracker-name }} and configure their access rights. To learn more about adding users, see [{#T}](add-users.md).

## Managing access {#access-management}

There are two types of user access rights to {{ tracker-name }}:

* Global access to {{ tracker-name }}:
    * [Administrator](#admin).
    * [Employee with full access](access.md#set).
    * [Employee with <q>Read-only</q>](access.md#readonly) access.

* Access to specific elements in {{ tracker-name }}:

    * [Queues](manager/queue-access.md). Access rights to create, view, and edit issues can be configured by the queue owner or another user who is granted access to [queue settings](manager/edit-queue-general.md).

       You can grant access to issues within a queue to individual users or specific groups and roles:
        * **Access**: Users listed in the **Access** field of an issue.
        * **Follower**: Users who subscribed to the issue.
        * **Reporter**: The person who created the issue.
        * **Assignee**: The person assigned to the issue.
        * **Queue owner**.
        * **Queue team members**: Users added to the [queue team](manager/queue-team.md).

        You can use [components](manager/queue-access.md#section_tbh_cs5_qbb) to limit user access to specific issues within a queue.

    * [Filters](user/create-filter.md#nastroit-dostup-k-filtru) and [dashboards](user/share-dashboard.md#section_k2z_1nk_pz). Access rights to filters and dashboards can be configured by the their owner or another user who received access rights from the owner.

{% note info %}

When managing the [{{ tracker-full-name }} API](about-api.md), all app requests are carried out on behalf of the {{ tracker-name }} user. To perform actions via the API, the user on whose behalf the requests are made must have sufficient rights in {{ tracker-name }}.

## Access levels {#roles}

A user's access level applies to all pages in {{ tracker-name }}. The access level determines the actions available to users, such as creating and editing issues, or changing the {{ tracker-name }} settings. Access levels are [configured by the admin](access.md).

#### Administrator {#admin}

The administrator has access to all {{ tracker-name }} elements. By default, the {{ tracker-name }} admin is the user who created the [company {{ yandex-cloud}}](../organization/).

If you wish to grant admin rights to other users, use [{{ ya-360 }}](https://yandex.ru/support/business/admin.html).

Actions available to admins:

* Adding [users](add-users.md) to {{ tracker-name }}  and configuring their [access levels](access.md).

* Managing {{ tracker-name }} settings: creating new [statuses](manager/workflow-status-edit.md#create-status), [resolutions](manager/create-resolution.md#create-resolution) and [issue types](manager/add-ticket-type.md#create-ticket-type), configuring [global issue fields](user/create-param.md#section_global_field), and adding [repositories](manager/add-repository.md).

* Managing [queue settings](manager/edit-queue-general.md).
