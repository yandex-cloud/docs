# Discontinuing support for the {{ tracker-name }} mobile app

In August, 2020, support for the {{ tracker-name }} mobile app for iOS and Android was discontinued.

We decided to discontinue support for the mobile app since its features were very limited compared to the {{ tracker-name }} web version and doesn't meet user expectations. We believe it would be better to focus on adapting the existing {{ tracker-name }} web interface to work smoothly on mobile devices. This makes the full Tracker feature suite available on all platforms.

If you already have the {{ tracker-name }} app installed on your device, you can still use it in its current iteration. However, this app will no longer be updated and will soon be removed from the AppStore and Google Play.

We recommend switching to the mobile version of {{ tracker-name }} to avoid possible inconvenience. To do this, open a web browser on your mobile device and visit {% if audience == "external" %}[https://tracker.yandex.ru](https://tracker.yandex.ru){% else %}[https://st.yandex-team.ru/](https://st.yandex-team.ru/){% endif %}.
