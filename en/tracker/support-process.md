# Setting up {{ tracker-full-name }} for a support team

Let's see how we can use {{ tracker-name }} to set up a workflow for the support team.

{{ tracker-name }} is a great tool for managing user requests because it lets the support team easily communicate with other departments that use {{ tracker-name }}. For example, you can use Tracker to invite developers to comments and solve complex problems together, link issues to other issues relevant to the user's request, and so on.

Let's create a dedicated {{ tracker-name }} [queue](queue-intro.md) for the support team to store issues created based on user requests. Now let's configure additional queue features that will help us process user requests more efficiently:

- [Accept requests from users who can't access {{ tracker-name }}.](support-process-mail-forms.md)
- [Organize multiple support lines to manage requests of different complexity levels.](support-process-lines.md)
- [Message users from the issue page.](support-process-send-mail.md)
- [Group requests by topic.](support-process-group.md)
- [Track the time it takes to process a request.](support-process-sla.md)
- [Collect request statistics.](support-process-dashboards.md)
- [Configure integration with third-party platforms.](support-process-integration.md)
