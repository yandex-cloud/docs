# Automation and templates

{{ tracker-name }} has several features that let you automate your workflow and save time on recurring actions:

1. [Triggers](user/trigger.md): Automatic issue actions triggered by certain events. You can use triggers to change issue parameters or send comments and HTTP requests.

1. [Auto actions](user/autoactions.md): Automatic recurring issue actions. You can use auto actions to [change issue parameters](user/create-autoaction.md) or [create new issue from a template](user/ticket-schedule.md).

1. [Macros](manager/create-macroses.md): Automatic issue actions initiated by the user. Macros can be used to change issue parameters or send automated comments.

1. [Templates](user/ticket-template.md): Templates used for standardized issues or comments.
