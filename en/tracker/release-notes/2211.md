## Filters on the user management page {#admin-users-filters}

The [**Administration** → **Users**]({{ link-tracker }}admin/users) page now supports filters by:
* Group.
* Organization.
* Date of last login.
* Permission.

## Sorting and grouping issues in the mobile app {#mobile-app-sorting}

The {{ tracker-name }} mobile app now lets you sort issues by a variety of parameters, such as type, queue, assignee, or deadline. You can choose the sorting order.

## Issue comment templates {#comment-templates}

Issue comments now have the **Templates** button for:
* Selecting the appropriate template from the list to display it in a comment.
* Creating a new comment template.
* Switching to the [template management page]({{ link-tracker }}settings/templates/comments).

## Displaying issues with resolution on a project's Gantt chart {#gantt-resolution}

On the project Gantt chart, completed issues are displayed with a crossed out key. Clicking on the key opens the issue panel on the right.

To set up panel display, add the key field to the Gantt chart's table space.

## Opening project issues on the project Gantt chart {#gantt-show-project-tasks}

The Gantt chart for projects now lets you display the timeline of issues within each project. To do this, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/checklist-open.png) next to the desired project in the list of projects on the left.

## Displaying external blockers on the Gantt chart for project issues {#gantt-projects-blocker}

If a project issue has blockers outside this project, a lock with the number of blocking issues is displayed to the left of the issue deadline. Clicking this icon opens a window with a list of blocking issues.

## Sharing a link to the completed form for issue creation {#share-task-form}

The form for creating issues now has a button that lets you copy a link to the completed form. The issue parameters that you specified in this form are preserved in the link.

## Retaining the selected filter in the list of projects {#save-project-filters}

The project list page now preserves each user's filter choice.

## Queue email address on any server {#any-mail-domain}

To set up email integration in {{ tracker-name }}, you can now use an email address created on any mail server.
To do this, register an email address on any mail server you like and add it to the [queue settings](../manager/queue-mail.md). All messages that arrive to this address will be converted to issues in the queue.
