## How to add users to {{ tracker-name }} {#section_yvw_tyk_nbb}

To let your employees use {{ tracker-name }}:

1. [Add employees to {{ tracker-name }}](enable-tracker.md#section_v3s_wp4_1cb). You can invite users with Yandex accounts to join your organization or configure an identity federation so that your employees could log in to Tracker with their corporate accounts.

1. Grant your employees [full access to {{ tracker-name }}](enable-tracker.md#access).

## Can an issue have multiple assignees? {#section_jlb_yyk_nbb}

An issue can only have one assignee at a time. There are several ways to organize the work of multiple people:

- If multiple people are working on the issue in turn, change the assignee at different points while the issue is in progress.
- If multiple people are working on the issue simultaneously, divide it into sub-issues and assign each one to a different person.

For more information about issues, see [Working with issues](user/ticket-in-progress.md).

## I don't have access to an issue {#section_xgr_zng_4bb}

The access permissions for issues are determined by the [queue settings](manager/queue-access.md).

If you don't have sufficient rights to access the queue page and its issues, contact the queue owner{% if audience == "external" %} or your organization's administrator{% endif %}. The queue owner's name is usually mentioned in the access restriction message.

If you can access the queue page but some of the issues remain unaccessible, some of the issues may include [components with limited access](manager/queue-access.md#section_tbh_cs5_qbb). If this is the case, please contact the queue owner.

## How can I find the queue owner? {#section_hgc_xyk_nbb}

The owner is listed on the **Description** tab on the queue page. For more information, see [List of queue issues](user/queue.md).
