## How to migrate from Yandex 360 to {{ org-full-name }}

Starting from {{release-date }} 2021, once you activate {{ tracker-full-name }}, an organization is automatically created in {{ org-full-name }}. Your organization's admin can connect [identity federation]({{ link-org-add-federation }}) to it so that your employees can log in to {{ tracker-name }} using their corporate accounts. You're charged for using {{ tracker-name }} through [{{ yandex-cloud }} billing](../billing/index.yaml).

If you activated {{ tracker-name }} before {{release-date }}, the service is linked to your company in Yandex 360. We'll move all organizations from Yandex 360 to {{ org-full-name }} stepwise without involving their admins. We'll notify an organization's admin in advance before carrying out migration to {{ org-full-name }}.

## How to delete an issue {#section_z1d_r1l_nbb}

You can't delete an issue, but you can close it with an appropriate resolution. For example, duplicate issues can be closed with the <q>Duplicate</q> resolution, while issues created by mistake can be closed with the <q>Canceled</q> resolution. For more information about issues, see [Working with issues](user/ticket-in-progress.md).

You can [delete a queue](manager/delete-queue.md) and all issues in it. [Move](user/move-ticket.md) the issues you don't need to a special queue and then delete it.

1. To the left of the queue name, select ![](../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Configure**.

1. Go to the **Basic settings** tab.

1. Click **Delete queue**.

## Can an issue have multiple assignees? {#section_jlb_yyk_nbb}

An issue can only have one assignee at a time. There are several ways to organize the work of multiple people:

- If multiple people are working on the issue in turn, change the assignee at different points while the issue is in progress.
- If multiple people are working on the issue simultaneously, divide it into sub-issues and assign each one to a different person.

For more information about issues, see [Working with issues](user/ticket-in-progress.md).

## I don't have access to an issue {#section_xgr_zng_4bb}

The access permissions for issues are determined by the [queue settings](manager/queue-access.md).

If you don't have sufficient rights to access the queue page and its issues, contact the queue owner{% if audience == "external" %} or your organization's administrator{% endif %}. The queue owner's name is usually mentioned in the access restriction message.

If you can access the queue page but some of the issues remain inaccessible, these issues may include [components with limited access](manager/queue-access.md#section_tbh_cs5_qbb). If this is the case, please contact the queue owner.

## How can I find the queue owner? {#section_hgc_xyk_nbb}

The owner is specified on the **Description** tab on the queue page. For more information, see [List of queue issues](user/queue.md).
