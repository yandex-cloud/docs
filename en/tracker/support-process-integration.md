# Configuring integration with third-party platforms

If you want to integrate third-party software into {{ tracker-name }} (such as a CRM system or call center software), use the {{ tracker-name }} API. For example, you can use the API to create issues in {{ tracker-name }} and then add additional information from third-party software. For more information about the {{ tracker-name }} API features, see the [API reference](about-api.md).

You can [use triggers](user/trigger.md) if you want to transfer information collected in {{ tracker-name }} to another environment (such as sending notifications to another messenger). To view examples for setting up triggers that send notifications to Slack and Telegram, see [{#T}](messenger.md).
