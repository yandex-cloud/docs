# Configure integration with third-party platforms

If you want to integrate {{ tracker-name }} with third-party software (such as a CRM system or call center software), use the {{ tracker-name }} API. For example, you can use the API to create issues in {{ tracker-name }} and then add additional information from third-party software. For more information about the {{ tracker-name }} API features, see the [API reference](about.md).

If you want to transfer information collected in {{ tracker-name }} to another system (such as sending notifications to another messenger), you can [use triggers](user/trigger.md). To view examples for setting up triggers that send notifications to Slack and Telegram, see [{#T}](messenger.md).
