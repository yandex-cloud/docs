## Selecting an organization for {{ tracker-name }} {#connect}

Starting April 17, 2023, you will be able to choose which service to use:

* To continue using both services, you will need to pay for {{ ya-360 }} usage based on the [selected service plan]({{ link-ya-360-tariffs }}). {{ tracker-name }} usage is paid for [separately](./pricing.md).

   {% note info %}

   If you do not pay for using {{ ya-360 }}, {{ tracker-name }} will continue running, but you will not be able to edit the list of your organization members.

   {% endnote %}

* To only use {{ org-full-name }}, you will need to disable the {{ ya-360 }} organization in the {{ tracker-name }} interface.

   {% note info %}

   If your organization is only running in {{ ya-360 }}, you will also be able to activate {{ org-full-name }}.

   {% endnote %}

* To only use {{ ya-360 }}, you will need to disable the {{ org-full-name }} organization in the {{ tracker-name }} interface.

## Linking {{ tracker-name }} to another organization {#reconnect}

In March 2023, administrators will be able to choose an organization when [activating](./enable-tracker.md) {{ tracker-name }}. Later on, administrators of multiple organizations will be able to change {{ tracker-name }} binding to an organization.

{% note info %}

Changing the organization {{ tracker-name }} is linked to only allowed within one organization management service: either {{ ya-360 }} or {{ org-full-name }}.

{% endnote %}

Once a new organization is linked, the current one will be disconnected from {{ tracker-name }}, {{ wiki-name }}, and {{ forms-name }}. Its data will not be lost. However, the current organization users will be marked as dismissed, the groups will be deleted, and the access rights will be revoked.

Users registered in both organizations with the same credentials will be able to continue using {{ tracker-name }} without any changes. For other users in the new organization, you will need to reconfigure access rights to {{ tracker-name }}, queues, filters, dashboards, {{ wiki-name }} pages, and forms in {{ forms-name }}.
