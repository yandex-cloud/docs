# Configuring queues

In {{ tracker-name }}, each issue is part of a queue. A queue is an area shared by related issues being worked on under a single product or pipeline. Queues can also be used as a list of issues meant for a specific team or department.

Queues help you organize issues and quickly find their assignees. For example, you can create separate queues for the HR department, a project team, and support staff.

Each queue can have its own unique workflow that best suits the team. To configure your pipeline, set issue stages (statuses) and their order in the queue, which make up the [workflow](manager/workflow.md). Standard workflows in {{ tracker-name }} already have their own [queue templates](manager/workflows.md).

You can use advanced features to make your queue workflow more efficient:

- Set up [automatic recurring actions](automation.md).
- Configure integration with {% if audience == "internal" %}[email](manager/queue-mail.md) and{% endif %} [Yandex.Forms](manager/forms-integration.md).
- Configure [access rights to issues within the queue](manager/queue-access.md).
- Structure your issues using [projects](manager/projects.md), [components](manager/components.md), and [versions](manager/versions.md).

To learn more about organizing your queue workflow, see an [example of configuring Tracker for the support team](support-process.md).
