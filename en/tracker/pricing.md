## Cost calculation {#sec_calculate}

How the monthly {{ tracker-name }} subscription fee is calculated:

* The monthly fee is based on the maximum number of users who simultaneously had access to {{ tracker-name }} during the month.

    {% note tip %}

    If you want to add new users to {{ tracker-name }} while simultaneously revoking access to {{ tracker-name }} for other users, we recommend revoking access for old users first and then adding new users. This will give you the lowest number of users with simultaneous access to {{ tracker-name }}.

    {% endnote %}

{% if audience == "draft" %}- If you accidentally granted access to {{ tracker-name }} to a user or team that won't use {{ tracker-name }}, you can revoke their access rights within 30 minutes. In that case, they won't be included when calculating the monthly subscription fee.
{% endif %}

* For large companies, the monthly fee is calculated on a progressive scale.

>
>* For the next 150 users — {% if region == "ru"%}{{ sku|RUB|b2b.tracker.license.v1|pricingRate.100|int|string }}{% endif %}{% if region == "kz"%}{{ sku|KZT|b2b.tracker.license.v1|pricingRate.100|int|string }}{% endif %}{% if region == "int"%}{{ sku|USD|b2b.tracker.license.v1|pricingRate.100|string }}{% endif %} per user per month.

>* For all users over 250 — {% if region == "ru"%}{{ sku|RUB|b2b.tracker.license.v1|pricingRate.250|int|string }}{% endif %}{% if region == "kz"%}{{ sku|KZT|b2b.tracker.license.v1|pricingRate.250|int|string }}{% endif %}{% if region == "int"%}{{ sku|USD|b2b.tracker.license.v1|pricingRate.250|string }}{% endif %} per user per month.
>
>The number of employees who had full access to {{ tracker-name }} changed in January:
>
>* 245 employees had full {{tracker-name}} access for 14 days.
>
>* The next 7 days saw 270 employees with access to Tracker.
>
>* Finally, during the last 10 days there were 260 employees with access to Tracker.
>
>During the month, the maximum number of users with access to {{ tracker-name }} at the same time was 270.
