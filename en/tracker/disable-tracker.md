# Disabling paid features in {{ tracker-name }}

{% note info %}

If you don't want to pay for {{ tracker-name }}, you can disable all paid features and have your employees use the free [<q>Read-only</q>](access.md#readonly) access mode. {{ tracker-name }} cannot be disabled fully.

{% endnote %}

To stop using paid {{ tracker-full-name }} features, revoke full access to {{ tracker-name }} from your employees. If no more than 5 users have full access, {{ tracker-name }} can be used free of charge. For more information, see [{#T}](pricing.md).

1. On the top panel in {{ tracker-name }}, click ![](../_assets/tracker/tracker-burger.png) → **Manage users**.

1. In the **All users** section, find the employees to revoke {{ tracker-name }} access from and select **Read only** in the **Access** column.



After you revoke access to {{ tracker-name }} from your employees, they won't be able to create and update issues. They can still view information in {{ tracker-name }}.
