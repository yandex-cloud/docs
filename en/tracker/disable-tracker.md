# Deactivating {{ tracker-name }}

{% note alert %}

Paid services will be deactivated automatically if your account balance is negative at the end of the month. For more information, see [Paying for Tracker](pricing.md#billing).

{% endnote %}

To deactivate {{ tracker-name }}:

1. Go to the [Yandex.Connect main page]({{ link-connect-main }}), find the {{ tracker-name }} card, and click  ![](../_assets/tracker/settings.png).

1. On the settings page in {{ tracker-name }}, click **Disable**.

Once {{ tracker-name }} is disabled, all your organization's employees will lose access. The service stores your information for 30 days after deactivation. If you decide not to renew your subscription, your data will be deleted.
