# How to disable paid features in {{ tracker-name }}

To stop using paid {{ tracker-full-name }} features, revoke full access to {{ tracker-name }} from your employees. If no more than 5 users have full access, {{ tracker-name }} can be used free of charge. For more information, see [{#T}](pricing.md).

1. On the top panel in {{ tracker-name }}, click ![](../_assets/tracker/tracker-burger.png) â†’ **Manage access**.

1. In the **All users** section, find the employees to revoke {{ tracker-name }} access from and select **Read only** in the **Access** column.

<!--1. To revoke access from all employees at once, select **Departments** on the left-hand panel and then **Read only** in the **All employees** row.-->

After you revoke access to {{ tracker-name }} from your employees, they won't be able to create and update issues. They can still view information in {{ tracker-name }}.
