## Ideas from our users {#your-ideas}


While working on our main goals, we also try to listen to our users' ideas. This month, we implemented the two most popular ideas:


### Canceling the sending of an email {#mail-timer}

**158 votes**

You can now cancel an email sent from an [issue comment](../user/comments.md). Click **Cancel** at the bottom of the screen within 5 seconds of sending an email: your email will not be sent and you will be able to edit the comment.

### New workflow editor {#workflow-editor}

**154 votes**

[Queue](../queue-intro.md) settings now have a visual editor for [workflows](../manager/create-work-process.md). All statuses and transitions are now displayed in the diagram. We also added some new settings, for example, you can now enable transitions to a status from all other statuses with just a single click.

## Updates {#top-news}

### Updated All Boards page {#new-boadrs-page}

The **All Boards** page has a new design.


### Inviting users to your organization {#invite-org}

You can now send users invitations to {{ org-full-name }} from the {{ tracker-name }} interface. You can send invitations to any email address, not just Yandex. Once a user accepts your invitation, they can select a Yandex account to use to join your organization or create a new account.


### Burn down chart {#burnout-diagramm}

[New boards](../manager/agile-new.md) with a [backlog](../manager/backlog.md) now have a **Burn down chart** tab available for the sprint selected. By default, the chart shows the current sprint.

### Saving Gantt chart settings to filter issues {#gantt-preset-colors}

[Gantt chart](../gantt/search.md) settings for issue system filters (**My projects**, **Created by me**, and other) are saved even after you refresh the page with the respective filter.


### Managing organizations {#org-add}

{{ tracker-name }} now lets you [change an organization](../cloud-vs-360.md#reconnect) from {{ ya-360 }} to {{ org-full-name }}.


### Color settings for filter and queue Gantt charts {#gantt-colors-queue}

You can now select a color for a specific issue in a Gantt chart for an issue [filter](../gantt/search.md) or [queue](../gantt/queue.md).

### Invitations to comments in projects {#project-summons}

You can now invite users to comment on the [project](../manager/project-new.md) either on the page or in the project card.

### Access to projects for customers {#customer-access}

We updated [project](../manager/project-new.md) access settings: now, when selecting the **All participants** access level, access is granted to the reporter, responsible employee, project participants, and customers.

### Displaying an issue list in a Gantt chart by filter or queue {#gantt-settings-columns}

In a Gantt chart created based on an issue filter or queue, you can select the issue parameters to be displayed in the list to the left of the chart. To select the desired parameters, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/settings-old.svg) in the top-right corner of the issue list in the chart.


### Onboarding for new {{ tracker-name }} users {#onboarding}

Onboarding is now available for new {{ tracker-name }} users: when they log in to {{ tracker-name }} for the first time, they can select a suitable [workflow template](../manager/create-work-process.md) and get a set of required tools.

### New boards in workflow templates {#new-boards-presets}

We updated [workflow templates](../manager/create-work-process.md): now, [new issue boards](../manager/agile-new.md) are created in them.


### Migrating to new boards {#create-board-popup}

Now, you can only create [new issue boards](../manager/agile-new.md). You can no longer create old boards, but you can continue to use all previously created ones.

## Fixes and improvements {#fixes}

### Retaining a sprint after you edit a board {#spint-saved}

Now, after you rename fields or update a set of fields in a card, the selected sprint remains on your [issue board](../manager/agile-new.md).

### Displaying issue links in a Gantt chart for projects {#gantt-linked-tasks}

In a [Gantt chart for projects](../gantt/project.md), you can now more effectively edit issue links by adding or removing blockers, dependent issues, or sub-issues. Now, changes you make to the chart apply to issues and immediately appear on charts opened by other users.

### Selecting a end date for a sprint {#sprint-end-date}

We fixed the error that prevented users from specifying an end date for a [sprint](../manager/create-agile-sprint.md). The **Other** option now works properly.

### Grouping issues on a board {#tasks-groups}

The [issue grouping](../manager/agile-new-issues.md#group) on the selected board remains after you refresh and open the page again.
