## Updates {#top-news}

### Limit on the number of issues per group on a board {#desks-groups-limits}

On [issue boards](../manager/agile-new.md) with [grouping](../manager/agile-new-issues.md#group) enabled, you can set the maximum number of issues per group. The number of issues may exceed the limit, in which case the group will be highlighted in yellow.

To set a limit on the number of issues per group, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/actions.svg) → **Maximum number of issues** to the right of the group name, specify the number of issues, and click **Save**. The limit can be applied to both a single group and all groups of the selected type.

### Changing the order of groups on issue boards{#desks-groups-order}

On issue boards with [grouping](../manager/agile-new-issues.md#group) enabled, you can now rank groups by dragging them. To do this, click **Change order** above the group list. In the window that opens, change the order of groups and click **Apply**.

{% note warning %}

Reordering is available for a groupings with fewer than 2,000 groups. You can only do the ranking for 10 groupings per board.

{% endnote %}

### Searching for local fields from dashboard queues {#find-local-params}

When creating and editing widgets on [dashboards](../user/dashboard.md), you can now search for local fields from specific queues.

To find a local field in a queue, specify the field name and the queue key in brackets, e.g., `Status (QUEUE)`.

### Critical path on a project's Gantt chart {#gantt-citical-path}

A [project's Gantt chart](../gantt/project.md) can now be configured to show the [critical path](../gantt/project.md#critical-path). To do that, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/gantt-critical-path.svg) above the timeline on the right:

* A red line will appear on the timeline. It indicates an interval from the start date of the earliest issue to the deadline of the latest issue.
* The issue with the latest deadline will be highlighted in red. All issues blocking the project's final issues will also be highlighted in red.

To disable critical path display, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/gantt-critical-path.svg) once again.

## Fixes and improvements {#fixes}

### Commits on issue pages {#tasks-commits}

In the new interface, there is now a **Commits** tab on issue pages. It is located at the bottom of the issue next to comments and is available if your {{ tracker-name }} has a [repository linked](../manager/add-repository.md) and if at least one commit has been made for the issue.

### Commits in queues {#queues-commits}

The new interface allows you to view commits from issues in a queue if your {{ tracker-name }} has a repository linked. To do this, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/actions.svg) → **Commits** in the top-right corner of the queue page.

### Strike-through for keys of canceled and completed issues {#strikethrough-key}

If an issue gets the **Completed** or **Canceled** status type, its key is now struck through on a greater number of pages than [before](2306.md#strikethrough-key). The changes apply to the following pages:

* Search
* List of filtered issues
* Gantt chart for filters
* Queue issue list
* Gantt chart for queues
* Dashboards
* Links with other issues

If an issue is closed with a certain resolution, its key is also struck through, as usual.

### Issue status color depending on status type {#status-colour}

Issue status is now colored depending on status type on a greater number of pages than [before](2306.md#{#gantt-colour-status}):

* List of filtered issues
* Gantt chart for filters
* Queue issue list
* Gantt chart for queues
* Dashboards
* Links with other issues
