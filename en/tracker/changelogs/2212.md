## Dashboards in the new interface {#new-dashboards}

[Dashboards](../user/dashboard.md) are now available in the new interface in the light and dark theme. You can place widgets on a dashboard in any order, move them relative to each other, and resize them.
You can't copy the updated dashboards or set up permissions for them so far. You can do that in the old interface version.

## Viewing group members {#show-group-members}

You can now open a list of users who are group members. To do this, go to [**Administration** → **Groups**]({{ link-tracker }}admin/groups) and click on the number of group members.

## Bulk edits to user permissions {#bulk-access-change}

You can now specify multiple users to update [permissions in {{ tracker-name }}](../access.md) for. To do this, go to [**Administration** → **Users**]({{ link-tracker }}admin/users), select the appropriate employees on the list, and choose one of the following:
* Grant full access.
* Grant read-only access.

To select all users, set the corresponding flag in the table header.

## Changing a project's author {#project-author}

You can now change the author of a [project](../manager/project-new.md). Keep in mind that the **Author** field can't be empty.

## Using local fields in boards and projects {#locale-filters}

[Local fields](../local-fields.md) are now available for filtering and displaying lists of issues on boards, in projects and Gantt charts.

## Adding issues to board groups {#create-groups}

You can now add issues with preset parameters to a group on a [board](../manager/agile-new.md) or in a [backlog](../manager/backlog.md). To do this, click **Add issue** under the list of issues in the group. This sets a value in a new or existing issue's field to group issues by. For example, <q>Assignee</q> or <q>Deadline</q>.

Restrictions:
* When grouping issues by queue, you can only create a new issue.
* When grouping issues by reporter, status, or type, you can't add a new issue.

To set up grouping, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/group.svg).

## Moving issues across board groups {#move-groups}

You can now move issues across groups on a [board](../manager/agile-new.md) or in a [backlog](../manager/backlog.md). When moving an issue, a new field value is set depending on the grouping criterion.

To set up grouping, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/group.svg).

## Automatically removing issues from boards {#auto-remove-from-board}

You can now automatically remove issues that were completed a long time ago from a board. To set up this feature on your board, click ![](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) in the top-right corner and select **Automatic issues removal**.

## Automatically extending parent issue deadlines on a Gantt chart {#gantt-parents}

The **Automatically extend the deadlines of the parent issue by the deadlines of sub-issues** setting has been added to a Gantt chart. If enabled, the deadlines of the parent issue are dynamically shifted depending on the changes to the sub-issue deadlines.

## Setting up the layout of a page with a Gantt chart {#gantt-view}

A Gantt chart now lets you set up the width of the issue list on the left and hide the list. The settings persist for the current user.

## Switching to the page of an issue created using a template from {{ forms-full-name }} {#forms}

When creating an issue from a [template in {{ forms-full-name }}](../user/forms-template.md), once you submit the form, you'll be redirected to the new issue page. If a template enables you to create multiple issues at a time, once you submit the form, you'll see a list of new issues.

## Default filter in the mobile app {#mobile-filters}

The issue filter you selected in the [{{ tracker-name }} mobile app](../mobile.md) is now displayed after you restart the app.
