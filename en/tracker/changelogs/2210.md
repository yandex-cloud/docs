## Managing user groups {#admin-groups}

Administrators can configure access permissions for user groups from Yandex 360. Now, they don't have to assign permissions to each user manually.

Groups can be set up under [**Administration** → **Groups**](https://tracker.yandex.ru/admin/groups).

## User management page {#users-page}

There is now a [page](https://tracker.yandex.ru/admin/users) for administrators with a list of all users and additional information about them:
* [Group](../access.md#group-access) membership.
* [Organization](../add-users.md#invite_user) membership.
* Date of last login to {{ tracker-full-name }}.
* [Access permissions](../role-model.md#roles).

The page is available under **Administration** → **Users**.

## "My issues" filter in the start page widget {#widget-my-issues}

When configuring the issues widget on the [start page](../user/startpage.md#tasks), you can use the **My issues** filter. It contains the issues created by you, assigned to you, or followed by you, or the issues that you were invited to comment and that need your response.

The list of filters in the app also lets you find your saved filters that you created in the {{ tracker-name }} interface.
