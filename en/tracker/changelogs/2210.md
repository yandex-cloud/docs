## Managing user groups {#admin-groups}

Administrators can configure access permissions for user groups from {{ yandex-360 }}. Now, they don't have to assign permissions to each user manually.

Groups can be set up under [**Administration** → **Groups**]({{ link-tracker }}admin/groups).

## User management page {#users-page}

There is now a [page]({{ link-tracker }}admin/users) for administrators with a list of all users and additional information about them:
* [Group](../access.md#group-access) membership.
* [Organization](../add-users.md#invite_user) membership.
* Date of last login to {{ tracker-full-name }}.
* [Access permissions](../role-model.md#roles).

The page is available under **Administration** → **Users**.

## "My issues" filter in the start page widget {#widget-my-issues}

When configuring the issues widget on the [start page](../user/startpage.md#tasks), you can use the **My issues** filter. It contains the issues created by you, assigned to you, or followed by you, or the issues that you were invited to comment and that need your response.

## Filtering issues in the {{ tracker-name }} mobile app {#filters-in-mobile-app}

The {{ tracker-full-name }} mobile app now supports issue filtering. Using filters, you can select issues by any parameter, such as:
* From the specified board.
* From a project.
* By assignee.
* By deadline, and so on.

The list of filters in the app also lets you find your saved filters that you created in the {{ tracker-name }} interface.

## Gantt chart updates {#gantt-news}

When scrolling through the Gantt chart of a project, list of projects, or issue filter, the page header is hidden.

{% endlist %}
