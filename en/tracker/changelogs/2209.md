## Creating a billing account {#billing-account}

In [**Administration** â†’ **Billing**](https://tracker.yandex.ru/admin/billing), you can now create a new billing account or activate an existing one for new organizations. If your organization already has a billing account activated, you can view its status, top it up, track spending, and analyze usage details in the **Billing** section.

[Learn more about billing accounts](../billing-account.md)

## When converting an issue to a project, issue comments are transferred, too {#copy-comments-from-project}

[Issue conversion to a project](../manager/create-project.md#----convert-from-task) is now more complete. A project is created with the following parameters of the original issue:

* Name, description, checklist
* Start date and end date.
* Comments.
* Reporter, assignee, and followers.

When transferring comments:
* Comments are copied along with attachments and links.
* The dates of the copied comments in the project will be the same as those of the comments in the issue.
* External messages aren't transferred.
* Only text is transferred from internal messages.

## A project lets you group issues by history {#story-grouping}

To group project issues by history, go to the **Issue list** tab and select the **By history** grouping type.

## Filters for searching by project {#project-filter}

The [**Projects**](https://tracker.yandex.ru/pages/projects) page now supports filtering by:
* Issue queues where the project issues are enqueued.
* Tag.
* Reporter, assignee, or client.
* Start or end date.
* Status.

## Project comments {#project-comments}

Projects now support comments that can be used in the same way as in regular issues:
* Add attachments.
* Add reactions.
* Use markup, including through WYSIWYG editor.
* Edit and delete comments.
* Respond to comments.

Invitations to comment, replies with a message, and notifications of comments are not available so far.

## Issue card macros {#scripts-in-cards}

You can run [macros](../manager/create-macroses.md) right in issue comments. If there are macros set up for a queue, the corresponding button appears in a comment. Clicking the button opens a list of macros where you can perform a search by name. You can add frequently used macros to your favorite ones: they will be displayed at the top of the list.

## Gantt chart updates {#gantt-news}

{% list tabs %}

- Gantt chart for project issues

  1. The Gantt chart for project issues supports sorting by any field. You can also use sorting in tree mode: the parent issues are sorted separately with sub-issues sorted within each of them.
  1. You can range project issues right on the Gantt chart. To do this, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/range.svg) in the left panel next to an issue and move it up or down. If grouping is enabled, ranking only works within a group. In tree mode, sub-issues are transferred together with their parent issue. You can also manage the hierarchy of issues: you can make any issue a sub-issue by placing it inside the parent issue or, vice versa, move a sub-issue to the parent issue level.

- Gantt chart for issue filters

  A Gantt chart is now available for any [issue list](https://tracker.yandex.ru/issues?_view=gantt), even with the filters set up. The chart shows links between issues, provided that the number of links is less than 500.

  When switching from the issue list to the Gantt chart and back, all the set filters are preserved in the link. You can share this link, all your configured filters remain unchanged.

{% endlist %}

## Arbitrary backlog columns {#backlog-columns}

You can create, move, and delete arbitrary columns in the backlog, except the first column. In addition, you can create issues inside columns and move them both within and across the columns.

## Importing issues to the backlog page {#import-backlog}

The backlog page allows importing issues to the backlog (for planning) or sprint (to immediately start working on issues).

## Actions with issue cards on boards {#cards-on-boards}

Backlog issue cards now let you perform the following actions:
* Adding issues to a sprint.
* Moving issues up or down.
* Removing issues from the backlog.

Sprint issue cards now let you perform the following actions:
* Moving issues to a different sprint.
* Returning issues to the backlog.
* Moving issues up or down.
* Removing issues from the backlog.

Cards of a board with a backlog now let you perform the following actions:
* Returning issues to the backlog, if there is a sprint (the sprint is removed).
* Moving issues to the sprint.

## Widgets on the start "My page" {#mypage-widgets}

There is a new pre-configured start page: **My page**. Users can add different widgets on it:
* Issues by any filter.
* Note.

An organization's administrator can create a widget named **Information for employees** to make important announcements for the entire company. This widget will be added to the start page of every employee.

The {{ tracker-name }} team has added to the page a widget with useful information about the service, links to documentation, communication channels, and video tutorials for new employees. The widget will help users learn {{ tracker-name }} faster.

Administrators can also use a widget from the {{ tracker-name }} team that describes the methods for inviting users to {{ tracker-name }}.

[Learn more about **My page** widgets](../user/startpage.md#my-page)

## Enabling the new interface as the main one {#new-interface}

Now, the new interface is enabled by default for all {{ tracker-name }} users. [**My page**](../user/startpage.md#my-page) is selected as the start page.

## Sorting issues on boards {#boards-sorting}

New boards and the backlog filters section now have the sort issues button. If sorting is set up, you can't move issues within a column. When moving an issue to a different column, sorting applies immediately.

## Bulk edits on boards{#boards-bulk}

New boards and the backlog now let you perform bulk edit operations. You can select issues in several ways:
* In a column's menu, to select all the column issues or multiple issues from one column.
* In an issue's menu, to select issues one by one.
* Using shortcuts: Shift + CMD+ Click to select a single issue or Shift + Click to select a range of issues in a column.

A panel for bulk operation selection appears at the bottom of the screen if at least one issue is selected.

## Dragging and dropping issues in backlog and sprint columns {#boards-drag-and-drop}

You can now range issues on boards by dragging and dropping issue cards. For example, you can:
* Range issues within the first column of a backlog.
* Range issues within a sprint.
* Move issues from backlogs to sprints.

You can also disable ranking in the sprint settings.
