* [Project tags](#project-tags)
* [Project filter by client](#projects-consumer-filter)

## Fullscreen mode for viewing boards {#fullscreen-boards-projects}

To make your work with boards even more convenient, we've added fullscreen mode. The {{ tracker-name }} side panel and filters in the header will be collapsed so that the board or project workspace takes up the entire screen made available. To activate fullscreen mode, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/fullscreen-agile.png) in the bottom-right corner.

You can also use fullscreen mode in Gantt charts.

## Retaining context in a project from its issue queues {#project-context}

When setting up filters for project issues, you can only select the values used in the project issue queues.

## Project tags {#project-tags}

Group projects by tagging them. The tags will be displayed on the common project page so that you can group projects by different topics.

## Project filter by client {#projects-consumer-filter}

To open the list of projects where you're a client, use the **I'm a client** filter.

## Setting the width of the content area in an issue {#width-settings}

You can expand the central content area in issues. To do this, open **Settings** → **Interface** and select the appropriate value of the **Content area** setting:
* Standard.
* Wide.
* Maximum.

{% note info %}

The setting only applies if the screen has enough space to expand the area.

{% endnote %}

## Gantt chart updates {#gantt-news}

{% list tabs %}

- Gantt chart for projects

  1. You can now set up chart columns, such as change their width. In this case, new formatting persists when updating the page.
  1. We also added grouping by issue. When grouping issues using multiple values (such as by tag, component, and goal), no links between the grouped issues are displayed.
  1. Charts support tree mode:
    * If you expand the parent issue's sub-issues and refresh the page, the expanded state is retained.
    * If the deadline of sub-issues is later than that of the parent issue, the deadline of the parent issue will be extended as a transparent bar on the chart.
    * Moving the parent issue along the chart also moves its sub-issues.
    * Changing the deadline of the parent issue (reducing or extending it) doesn't affect the deadline of its sub-issues.
  1. In tree mode, you can create a sub-issue on the chart. The chart displays the created sub-issue first among all the sub-issues of the parent issue.

- Gantt chart for a list of projects

  1. The Gantt chart is also available for all of your projects on the [projects page](https://tracker.yandex.ru/pages/projects).
  1. For the list of projects, the chart shows user profile images (avatars). You can click the profile image to change the user responsible for the project.

{% endlist %}


## Enabling a backlog on new boards {#backlog-in-boards}

You can enable a backlog on new boards. Once the option is enabled, the **Backlog** and **Board** tabs appear on the board.
