# Configuring an SLA for issues

In {{ tracker-name }}, an SLA is a [set of rules](manager/sla.md) that defines a timeframe for processing issues in the queue. For example you can set up a time limit during which the assignee must respond to a new issue, respond to a client's comment or completely finish their work on the issue. If the assignee doesn't react within this amount of time, {{ tracker-name }} will send you a notification.

SLAs can be used to [monitor request processing speed](support-process-sla.md) for the support service.

You can filter issues by each rule, set up timer start and end conditions, and [specify your work schedule](manager/schedule.md).
