# Payments

The billing period in {{ tracker-full-name }} is one calendar month. On the second day of each month, you'll be charged for the services used during the previous month.

{% note alert %}

The payment is automatically debited from the billing account linked to {{ tracker-name }}. We recommend that you top up your account in advance.

{% endnote %}

If there is not enough money in your account on the payment date, you may have a negative balance and will enter into arrears. If the account balance is negative at the end of the month, all users from your company will be switched to [<q>Read only</q>](access.md#readonly) mode.

To restore full access to {{ tracker-name }}, top up your account so that your balance is positive.
