# Adding comments to issues

You can use comments to leave notes about the work progress, ask questions about the issue description, and invite your teammates to discuss the issue.

{% note tip %}

If you only discuss an issue in the comments, you will always have access to a full history of its discussion.

{% endnote %}

## Leaving a comment {#leave-comment}

To comment on an issue, enter your text in the **Write a comment** box at the bottom of the screen and tap ![](../../_assets/tracker/send.png). In the comments section, you can use [text markup](../user/markup.md) and [attach images and files](#sec_file). To expand the comment box to full screen, tap ![](../../_assets/tracker/open-text.png).

You can use the comments section to specify a key for a different issue so that {{ tracker-name }} automatically [links](ticket-links.md#add-link) the issue.

## Replying to comments {#answer-comment}
