# Activating {{ tracker-full-name }}

If you aren't using {{ tracker-full-name }} to manage issues in your company, you can connect it. To work in {{ tracker-name }}, you'll need a [{{ yandex-cloud }} organization](../../organization/). If you already have an organization, connect {{ tracker-name }} to it. If you have no organization, you can create it when connecting {{ tracker-name }}.

{% note warning %}

Only the users that have an account on Yandex can connect {{ tracker-name }}.

If the administrator of your organization already connected {{ tracker-name }}, to start working with issues, [log in to the service](../user/login.md).

{% endnote %}
