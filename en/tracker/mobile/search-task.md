# Finding issues by key or name

If you know the name of an issue or its key, you can search for it using the search bar or query language.

At the top of the screen, enter the issue name or key in the **Search by all issues** field. As a result, you'll see a list with the issues that meet the query criteria. The list shows the first 20 entries. If you didn't find the issue you need, refine your query.
