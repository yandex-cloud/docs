# My issues

To find issues you're working on:

1. Open the {{ tracker-full-name }} mobile app.

1. To find the issues in which you are the reporter, assignee, or follower, select the **All my issues** filter.

1. To search for issues in the list, use [quick filters](#q-filters) or [add search criteria](default-filters.md#add-condition).

## Quick filters {#q-filters}

* To use standard filters, click the filter name in the list in the bottom-left corner of the page.
   * **Favorite issues**.
   * **All my issues**.
   * **Reported by me**.
   * **Assigned to me**.
   * **Followed by me**.
   * **Waiting for response**.
   * **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_IssuesPresetSelect.preset-deadline }}**.

* To filter issues by their [resolution](../manager/create-resolution.md), tap **{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.fields.issue.resolution-key-value }}** and select relevant values from the list.

* To use [advanced search parameters](./default-filters.md#add-condition), click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/gantt-settings-button.svg) and select a parameter.

## Searching for issues by name {#search-name}

In the **Search by name, description, comments** field, enter the text to find.
