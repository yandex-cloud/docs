# Logging in to {{ tracker-name }}

If {{ tracker-full-name }} is connected for your organization, to work with your issues, log into your account.

{% note info %}

{% endnote %}

Depending on your organization settings, you can use accounts of different types when working in {{ tracker-name }}. Ask the administrator of your organization about which account should be used for logging in:

* Yandex account, for example `{{ example-account }}`.

* Account on the domain connected to [{{ ya-360 }}]({{ link-ya-360 }}) (for example, `login@example.com`).

* Account in the corporate account management system (for example, Active Directory or Google Workspace), if [single sign-on](../../organization/add-federation.md) is enabled.

To create and edit issues, you'll need [full access](../access.md) to {{ tracker-name }}. If you only have read access to {{ tracker-name }}, contact your organization's administrator.
