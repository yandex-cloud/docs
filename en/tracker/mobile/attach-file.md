# Attaching images and files to an issue

You can attach multiple files in any format to an issue. The maximum size of a single file is 128 MB.
The files that you add in {{ tracker-name }} don't consume space on Yandex&#160;Disk. {{ tracker-name }} doesn't restrict the amount of stored data.

To attach a file to an issue description:

1. Click ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-edit.png) next to the issue description.

1. At the bottom of the screen, tap ![](../../_assets/tracker/pin.png). In the dialog box that opens, allow access to your phone's camera and files.

   * To add a photo or video from your phone's camera, tap **Camera**. When everything is ready, tap **OK**. To take a new photo or video, tap **Repeat**.

   * To attach files from your phone, tap **Files** and select them.

1. Click **Save**.

You can similarly attach a file to a comment.

The attached files are displayed under the issue description, or below the comment.
