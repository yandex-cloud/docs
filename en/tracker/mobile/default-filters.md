# Finding my issues

To find the issues you're working on, use the _system filters_ preset. The filters return the lists of issues where you were specified as an assignee, reporter, or in other roles. To search for issues in the list, use [standard filters](#sys_filters) or [add search criteria](#add-condition).

## Using standard filters {#sys_filters}

Find your issues using preset system filters.

1. In the top-left corner, click **All issues**, then select one of the options:

   * **Favorite issues**: Issues that you [added to Favorites](../user/favourites.md#task-fav).

   * **All my issues**: Issues that list you as the reporter, assignee, or follower.

   * **Reported by me**: Issues that you created.

   * **Assigned to me**: Issues that list you as the assignee.

   * **Followed by me**: Issues that you [subscribed to](../user/subscribe.md#section_xt5_xrv_jz) for updates.

   * **Needs response**: Issues you were [invited to comment on](comments.md#call-comment).

   * **Deadline approaching**: Issues that list you as the reporter, assignee, or follower and where:

   * Issues that have exceeded their deadlines in the past two weeks ![](../../_assets/tracker/deadline-red.png).

   * The deadline will be due within three months ![](../../_assets/tracker/deadline-grey.png).


1. After setting the filter, you'll see the selected issue list.

## Adding search parameters {#add-condition}

#### Searching by parameters

To find issues by the parameters that can't be set using the system filters, add search conditions.

1. In the top-right corner, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/gantt-settings-button.svg).

1. Select an issue parameter, set its value, and click **Apply**.

   Any issues that don't meet your criteria are filtered out of the list.


1. If you need to refine the search conditions, add more parameters.

1. To reset the search parameters, click **Reset** in the top-right corner of the **Filters** page.
