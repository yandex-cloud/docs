# Creating an issue via email

To create an issue via email, send a message with the issue description to the [queue address](../manager/queue-mail.md):


1. Make sure that you added an [email address](../manager/queue-mail.md) for issue creation to your queue.

1. Check that you have [access to the queue](../manager/queue-access.md).


1. Creating a new message.

   {% note tip %}

   Create a new message for every issue. If you respond to a {{ tracker-name }} email or send an existing email again, it appears as an issue comment.

   {% endnote %}

1. Enter the issue name in the **Subject** field.

1. Describe the issue in the email body.

1. Send the email to the address specified in the [queue settings](../manager/queue-mail.md).

You'll receive a reply notifying you that a new issue was created.
