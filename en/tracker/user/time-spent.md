# Specifying time spent

{{ tracker-name }} can keep a record of the time you spent on an issue.

To make sure issue statistics are correct, do not enter any data for another employee. It's important that each assignee register the time spent themselves.

Time is tracked in business weeks (5 work days), business hours (8 hours), hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Time tracking {#spent-time}

The **Time tracking** section displays the time allotted to and spent on resolving the issue.

Before you start working on your issue, we recommend specifying the time you plan to spend on it. Once you finish, you will be able to compare your estimate with how much time you actually spent on the issue.

* **Original estimate**: How much time you're planning to spend on the issue.

* **Estimate**: You can specify how much time you still need to resolve the issue. Fill it in before or after you begin working on the issue.

    * If you don't specify a time value in the **Original estimate** field, the value in the **Estimate** field will be recalculated each time you [register the time spent](#section_y1t_gkh_vcb) on the issue.

    * If you specified a time value in the **Original estimate** field, the value in the **Estimate** field will start to decrease accordingly once you go over your initial estimate.

* **Time spent**: How much time you eventually spent on the issue. If you added [multiple records of time spent](#section_y1t_gkh_vcb) on an issue, this field will display the total time spent.

## Specifying time spent {#section_y1t_gkh_vcb}

To register the time spent:

1. Open the issue page.

1. Select **Actions** â†’ **Add time spent**.

1. Fill in the **Time spent** field.

   Example:
   * 1 week and 3 days: `1w 3d`, `1w 3d`.
   * 3 hours, 20 minutes, and 30 seconds: `3h 20m 30s`, `3h 20m 30s`.

1. If necessary, enter the start time and leave a comment. The comment won't be visible in the issue, but it will be saved in the [Time Spent Report](../manager/statistics.md#section_uxt_3ft_xz).

1. Click **Save**.

{% note info  %}

You can add multiple entries. The time entered is summed up.

You can only change the saved value via an [API request](../concepts/issues/patch-worklog.md).

{% endnote %}

Any user can record the time spent, not just the issue assignee. The [Time Spent Report](../manager/statistics.md#section_uxt_3ft_xz) will show the time spent by all users who added time to the issue.
