# Registering time spent

{{ tracker-name }} can keep a record of the time you spent on an issue.

To make sure issue statistics are correct, do not enter any data for another employee. It's important that each assignee register the time spent themselves.

## Time tracking {#section_y1t_gkh_vcb}

To register the time spent:

1. Open the issue page.

1. Choose **Actions** â†’ **Add time spent**.

1. Fill in **Time spent**. Time is tracked in business weeks (5 work days), business hours (8 hours), hours, minutes, and seconds. Example:
    - 1 week and 3 days: `1w 3d`, `1w 3d`.
    - 3 hours, 20 minutes, and 30 seconds: `3h 20m 30s`, `3h 20m 30s`.

1. If necessary, enter the start time and leave a comment. The comment won't be visible in the issue, but it will be saved in the [Time Spent Report](../manager/statistics.md#section_uxt_3ft_xz).

1. Click **Save**.

Any user can record the time spent, not just the issue assignee. The [Time Spent Report](../manager/statistics.md#section_uxt_3ft_xz) will show the time spent by all users who added time to the issue.

## View time spent {#section_cqc_hkh_vcb}

You can view the time spent on an issue in the details on the right panel or in the [Time Spent Report](../manager/statistics.md#section_uxt_3ft_xz).

If the **Time spent** section is not displayed in the issue details, add it:

1. Click **![](../../_assets/tracker/task-params-btn.png) Select fields** on the issue details panel.

1. Under **Time spent**, enable the **Estimate** and **Time spent** options.

You can use the **Estimate** field to estimate the time needed to resolve the issue. Fill it in when you begin working on the issue. Each time you record the time spent, the estimation will decrease by the amount you enter.
