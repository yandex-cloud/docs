# Templates

To create preset issues and comments, configure personal templates. If you want to share your templates with colleagues, set up template sharing.

Templates help you:

* Spend less time creating issues and comments.
* Use a standard formatting style for your issues or team issues.
* Reduce the number of mistakes and typos in issues.

{% note tip %}

To create an issue template for a specific queue and add it to the issue creation page, [use {{ forms-full-name }}](forms-template.md).

{% endnote %}

* [{#T}](create-template.md)
* [{#T}](edit-template.md)
* [{#T}](delete-template.md)
* [{#T}](share-template.md)
