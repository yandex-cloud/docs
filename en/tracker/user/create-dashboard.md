# Creating a dashboard

You can add several dashboards, each with its set of widgets and switch between them as needed. You can make any of your dashboards your start page or share it with a coworker.

To create a dashboard:

1. In the left-hand panel, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/dashboards.svg)&nbsp;**Dashboards** → **New dashboard**.

1. Enter a name for the dashboard and click **Create**.

1. In the top-right corner, click **Edit** and select widgets one by one from the **Add widget** list to configure them. The following widgets are available in {{ tracker-name }}:

   - [Issues](widgets.md#tasks)
   - [Note Widget](widgets.md#note)
   - [Summary table](widgets.md#summary-table)
   - [Summary table with totaled values](widgets.md#summary-table-with-totals)
   - [Events](widgets.md#events)
   - [Issue Statistics](widgets.md#issues-stat)
   - [Created vs. Resolved Graph](widgets.md#created-and-resolved)

   Widgets let you view issue analytics. Issues are selected for widgets using a [query language](query-filter.md) or [filter](create-filter.md). You can select a filter from the list of preset and custom filters or set it manually right on the widget creation page.

1. Arrange the widgets however you like, set their sizes, and click **Save**.
