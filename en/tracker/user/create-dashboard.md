# Creating a dashboard

You can create multiple dashboards with different sets of widgets and switch between them as necessary. You can make any of your dashboards your home page or share it with a coworker.

To create a dashboard:

1. Select **Dashboards** → **Create dashboard** on the {{ tracker-name }} top panel.

1. Enter the name of the dashboard and choose a widget arrangement.

1. Add widgets and configure them. There are several types of widgets:
    - [Issue list](widgets.md#section_ll1_zdp_pz): This type of widget contains a list of issues that meet a specific filter.
    - [Pivot table](widgets.md#section_esm_vjp_pz): This type of widget displays a table with statistics for issues.
    - [Statistics widget](widgets.md#section_htb_kvp_pz): This type of widget shows issue statistics as a chart or graph.
    - [Notes](widgets.md#section_rtw_3gr_pz): This type of widget is for your notes.

- [Invitation form](widgets.md#invite_form): This type of widget lets you invite your colleagues to {{ tracker-name }}.

    Most widgets contain information about a specific set of issues. The list of issues to include in the widget is set using a filter. You can set filters using [direct links, names](create-filter.md) or the [query language](query-filter.md).

1. Arrange the widgets however you like and click **Save**.

1. Enter a name for your new dashboard and click **Save**.

You will be the owner of the new dashboard. You can change it, edit the widgets, and set access rights.
