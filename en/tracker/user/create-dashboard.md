# How to create a dashboard

You can create multiple dashboards with different sets of widgets and switch between them as necessary. You can make any of your dashboards your home page or share it with a coworker.

To create a dashboard:

1. Choose **Dashboards** → **New dashboard** on the top panel in {{ tracker-name }}.

1. Enter the name of the dashboard and choose a widget arrangement.

1. Add widgets and configure them. There are several types of widgets:
    - [Issues](widgets.md#section_ll1_zdp_pz): This type of widget contains a list of issues that meet a specific filter.
    - [Summary table](widgets.md#section_esm_vjp_pz): This type of widget displays a table with statistics for issues.
    - [Issue Statistics](widgets.md#section_htb_kvp_pz): This type of widget shows statistics as a chart or graph.
    - [Note Widget](widgets.md#section_rtw_3gr_pz): This type of widget is for your notes.

    Most widgets contain information about a specific set of issues. The list of issues to include in the widget is set using a [filter](filters.md). You can set the filter using a [direct link](filters.md), [name](create-filter.md), or the [query language](query-filter.md).

1. Arrange the widgets however is convenient and click **Save**.
