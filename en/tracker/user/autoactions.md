# Auto actions

{% note warning %}

By default, only a [queue owner](../manager/queue-access.md) can create, edit, and delete auto actions. No more than 100 auto actions can be created for a single queue.

{% endnote %}

An auto action is a set of actions on the queue's issues that is applied automatically at a given interval.

Use auto actions for:

- [Change issue fields that match a filter](create-autoaction.md).
- [Set up scheduled issue creation based on a template](ticket-schedule.md).
