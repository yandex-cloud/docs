# Auto actions

{% note warning %}

By default, only a [queue owner](../manager/queue-access.md) can create, edit, and delete auto actions. You can create a maximum of 100 auto actions per queue.

{% endnote %}

An auto action is a set of actions that run on a schedule and can automatically be applied to issues in a queue.

You can use auto actions to:

- [Change issue fields that match a filter](create-autoaction.md).
- [Set up scheduled issue creation based on a template](ticket-schedule.md).
