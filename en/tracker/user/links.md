# Links between issues

Issue links help group multiple issues based on a common theme or view the issue hierarchy.

{{ tracker-name }} has several link types:

Parent issue — Sub-issue
:  You can use this link type to decompose your issues. Break larger project chunks into standalone issues and sub-issues.
:  Let's say you need to implement a new feature in your product, which implies resolving multiple smaller issues. For such cases, you can create a <q>New feature</q> type parent issue and link your sub-issues to it.

Related to 
:  Use this link type to reference other issues with a common theme.

Depends on — Blocker to
:  Use this link type if a certain issue can only be worked on once another issue is completed. For instance, a new app feature that can only enter development once the interface has been designed.

Duplicated by — Duplicates
:  Use this link type to group issues that describe the same task. As an example, this link should be used if you created multiple <q>Bug</q> type issues that describe the same problem.

Epic for — Sub-epic
:  Use this link type to decompose issues if [you're working with Scrum](../manager/create-agile-sprint.md#section_vj5_4f5_zfb).

You can view and edit the list of links on the [issue page](ticket-links.md).
