# Query language

If the basic filters don&apos;t give you enough options, use the query language to define a filter.

The query language allows you to:

- Search for issues [by name, description, and comment](#section_qsz_glk_lz).

- Filter issues [by multiple values in a single field](#section_pf4_slk_lz).

- Use [comparison operators](#section_kws_ylk_lz) and [logical operators](#section_yqw_fmk_lz) in filters.

- Specify [functions](#section_pmb_kmk_lz) as a comparison value.

- Set the [sorting order](#section_f3y_kpk_lz) for issues in the filter results.

## Query format {#section_pgq_xjk_lz}

To define a filter using the query language:

1. On the top panel in {{ tracker-name }}, choose **Issues** â†’ **Find issues**.

1. Click **Query language** in the upper-right corner.

1. Enter a query and click **Apply**.

The basic format of the query is:

```no-highlight
"parameter": "value"
```

To set the parameter, start typing its name and choose the appropriate one from the suggestions. For the full list of parameters, see [Filter parameters](#section_d5p_d4n_jdb).

#### Examples

- Issues that are in the `TEST` queue:

    ```no-highlight
    "Queue": "TEST"
    ```
- Issues that are assigned to Alice Little:

    ```no-highlight
    "Assignee": "Alice Little"
    ```
- Issues with the status `Open` or `In progress`.

    ```no-highlight
    "Status": "Open", "In progress"
    ```
- Issues created from January 1 to January 30, 2017:

    ```no-highlight
    "Created": "2017-01-01".."2017-01-30"
    ```

## Multiple parameter values {#section_pf4_slk_lz}

If you want to filter issues by multiple values for the same parameter, separate them with commas:

```no-highlight
parameter: "value1", "value2", " value3"
```

#### Example

```no-highlight
author: "vpupkin","iivanov"
```


This filter outputs all issues that were reported by `vpupkin` or `iivanov`.

## Filters with multiple conditions {#section_yqw_fmk_lz}

You can combine multiple conditions in a single filter using Boolean operators:

- `AND`: The logical **AND** operator. Conditions combined with this operator must all be met at the same time.

    Example:

    ```no-highlight
    parameter1: "value1" AND parameter2: "value2"
    ```

    This query outputs issues where `parameter1` is set to `value1` **and** `parameter2` is set to `value2`.

    {% note info %}

    Instead of using the `AND` operator, you can just list the fields separated by a space.

    {% endnote %}

- `OR`: The logical **OR** operator. At least one of the conditions combined with this operator must be met.

    Example:

    ```no-highlight
    parameter1: "value1" OR parameter2: "value2"
    ```

    This query outputs issues where `parameter1` is set to `value1` **or** `parameter2` is set to `value2`.

You can create complex filters by combining multiple operators in a single query:

```no-highlight
parameter1: "value1" AND parameter2: "value2" OR parameter3: "value3"
```

When complex filters are processed, the `AND` operators are applied first. Use parentheses to change the order of actions:

```no-highlight
parameter1: "value1" AND (parameter2: "value2" OR parameter3: "value3")
```

## Text search {#section_qsz_glk_lz}

In addition to searching by parameters, you can also use the familiar text search. To do this, enter text in the query field and click **Apply**.

The search is performed across all the text fields in the issue: name, description, and comments.

- To search in only one of the fields, use the parameter to specify it:

    - `Summary`: The issue name.

    - `Description`: The issue description.

    - `Comment`: Text in comments.

    - `History`: Text in the history of changes.

    ```no-highlight
    Description: "Off with her head"
    ```

    This filter outputs all the issues that have a description containing the words and close forms of the words in the query.

- To only find issues with text that exactly matches the query text, use the `#` operator:

    ```no-highlight
    Summary: #"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
    ```

    This filter only outputs the issues whose name exactly matches the query text.

- To only find issues that have no text specified in the query, use the `~` operator:

    ```no-highlight
    Comment: ~"Consectetur adipiscing elit"
    ```

    This filter only outputs the issues whose comments don't match the query text.

## Searching by user {#section_search_by_user}

You can search for issues by users' real names and usernames specified in issue fields. There are multiple ways to specify a real name or a username in your query:

- Putting the first and last name in quotation marks: `"first_name last_name"`. Used to search for an exact match with the user's first and last name.

    Example:

    ```no-highlight
    Author: "Alice Little"
    ```

    Entering this query will display all issues where the author is specified as Alice Little.

- Entering a username and putting `@` at the end: `login@`. Used to search for an exact match containing this username.

    Example:

    ```no-highlight
    Assignee: user3370@ 
    ```

    This query will display all issues that have `user3370` specified as the assignee.

- Entering a user's first name, last name, or username. Used for searching for exact matches containing either of those.

    Examples:

    - `Followers: Alice`. This query will display all issues followed by users with the first name Alice no matter what their last name is.

    - `Followers: alice`. This query will display all issues followed by the user with the username `alice@` or any user named Alice {% if locale == "ru" %}(if the name is specified in English){% endif %}.

{% if audience == "internal" %}

## Searching by local field {#local_fields}

To specify the value of an [issue's local field](../local-fields.md) in a query, enter the key of the queue that the field is linked to and then the field name or key after a dot. Examples:

```
DEVS."Tester": "Alice Little"
```

```
DEVS.tester: user3370@
```

{% endif %}

## Date and time parameters {#section_lyr_qjj_nz}

Many issue parameters have date and time values. The query language supports several formats for these parameters:

#### Date

- MM/DD/YYYY

    Example:

    ```
    04/30/2017
    ```

- DD.MM.YYYY

    Example:

    ```
    30.04.2017
    ```

- DD-MM-YYYY

    Example:

    ```
    30-04-2017
    ```

- YYYY-MM-DD

    Example:

    ```
    2017-04-30
    ```

#### Time

- You can set time intervals in weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds in the format:

    ```
    "XXw XXd XXh XXm XXs"
    ```

    For example, a time interval of 3 days 5 hours and 32 minutes is written as:

    ```
    "3d 5h 32m"
    ```

When searching fields that contain a date, you can use the addition and subtraction operations, time ranges, and [functions](#section_pmb_kmk_lz).

Here is an example of a filter for issues created no earlier than eight days ago:

```
Created: > today() - "1w 1d"
```

A filter for issues that were created in a certain period of time:

```
Created: 01-01-2017 .. 02-03-2017
```

## Comparison operations {#section_kws_ylk_lz}

In addition to looking for exact matches, the query language supports comparisons:

- **Not equal to**

    ```no-highlight
    parameter: !"value"
    ```

- **Greater than**, **Less than**, **Less than or equal to**, **Greater than or equal to**

    These operations are only applied to numeric parameters and date and time parameters.

    ```no-highlight
    parameter: >number
    parameter: <number
    parameter: >=number
    parameter: <=number
    ```

- **In the range**

    This operation is only applied to numeric parameters.

    ```no-highlight
    parameter: number1 .. number2
    ```

## Functions {#section_pmb_kmk_lz}

In addition to explicit parameter values, you can use functions. A function is a variable with a value that is calculated when the request is executed. For example, the function `today()` takes the value of today's date. To show all issues created today, use the query:

```no-highlight
Created: today()
```

| Function | Result | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| ```empty()  ``` | Empty value (parameter omitted) | Find issues that don't have an assignee:<br/>``` Assignee: empty()``` |
| ```notEmpty() ``` | Any non-empty value (parameter set) | Find issues that have a deadline set:<br/>``` Deadline: notEmpty()``` |
| ```me()``` | Name of the user who made the request | Find issues that you created:<br/>``` Author: me()``` |
| ```now() ``` | Current time to the minute | Find issues created in the last 12 hours:<br/>``` Created: >now()-12h ``` |
| ```today() ``` | Time interval corresponding to the current date | Find issues created today:<br/>``` Created: today() ``` |
| ```week() ``` | Date range corresponding to the current week | Find issues created this week:<br/>``` Created: week() ``` |
| ```month()  ``` | Date range corresponding to the current month | Find issues created this month:<br/>``` Created: month() ``` |
| ```quarter()  ``` | Date range corresponding to the current quarter | Find issues created in this quarter:<br/>``` Created: quarter() ``` |
| ```year() ``` | Date range for the current year | Find issues created this year:<br/>``` Created: year() ``` |
| ```unresolved() ``` | No resolution | Find all issues that do not have a resolution set:<br/>``` Resolution: unresolved() ``` |
| ```group() ``` | List of department employees | Find issues that employees of the Sales department are working on:<br/>``` Assignee: group(value: "Sales department") ``` |

## Search for parameter changes {#section_i1y_lgr_3bb}

If you know when and how a parameter was changed for an issue, you can create a filter for it:

```
"parameter": changed(from: "old value" to: "new value" by: "who changed" date: "when changed")
```

For example, to get a list of issues that user Alice Little switched to the status "In progress" in a certain time period, make the query:

```
Status: changed(to: "In progress" by: "Alice Little" date: 01.09.2017 .. 15.09.2017)
```

## Sort results {#section_f3y_kpk_lz}

You can sort the filter results by setting the `"Sort By"` parameter at the end of the query. For the value, specify the name of the field to sort by:

```no-highlight
"Sort By": Created
```

If necessary, sort by ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order:

```no-highlight
"Sort By": Created ASC
```

To specify multiple fields to sort by, separate them with commas in order of priority:

```no-highlight
"Sort By": Created ASC, Updated DESC
```

## Useful queries {#section_rv3_zr1_mz}

Try a few ready-made queries to learn how they work:

- Active issues that you created:

    ```no-highlight
    Author: me() Resolution: empty()
    ```

- Active issues that you are assigned to:

    ```no-highlight
    Assignee: me() Resolution: empty()
    ```

- Active issues that you are following:

    ```no-highlight
    Followers: me() Resolution: empty()
    ```

- Issues that you are assigned to that have a deadline during the current week:

    ```no-highlight
    Assignee: me() Deadline: week()
    ```

- Issues with **Critical** or **Blocker** priority that you are the reporter, assignee, or follower for.

    ```no-highlight
    (Followers: me() OR Assignee: me() OR Author: me()) AND Resolution: empty() AND Priority: Blocker, Critical
    ```
