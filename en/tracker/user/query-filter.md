title: "Query language in Yandex Tracker"
description: "This section describes the Yandex Tracker query language. The query language allows you to search for tasks by name, description and comments, filter tasks by several values of one parameter, use comparison operations and logical operators in filters, specify functions as a value for comparison, and also set the sort order of tasks in the filter results. "

# Query language

If the basic filters don&apos;t give you enough options, use the query language to define a filter.

The query language allows you to:

* Search for issues [by name, description, and comment](#query-text).

* Filter issues [by multiple values of a single field](#query-multiple-values).

* Use the [comparison operators](#query-compare) and [logical operators](#query-multiple-conditions) in filters.

* Specify [functions](#query-functions) as a comparison value.

* Set the [sort order](#query-result-sort) for issues in the filter results.

## Query format {#query-format}

To define a filter using the query language:

1. On the {{ tracker-name }} top panel, select **Issues** â†’ **Find issues**.

1. Click **Query language** in the upper-right corner.

1. Enter a query and click **Apply**.

The basic format of the query is:

```no-highlight
"parameter": "value"
```

To set the parameter, start typing its name and choose the appropriate one from the suggestions. For the full list of parameters, see [Filter parameters](#filter-parameters).

#### Examples {#format-example}

> - Issues that are in the `TEST` queue:
>
>    ```no-highlight
>    "Queue": "TEST"
>    ```
> - Issues that are assigned to Alice Little:
>
>    ```no-highlight
>    "Assignee": "Alice Little"
>    ```
> - Issues with the `Open` or `In progress` status.
>
>    ```no-highlight
>    "Status": "Open", "In progress"
>    ```
> - Issues created from January 1 to January 30, 2017:
>
>    ```no-highlight
>    "Created": "2017-01-01".."2017-01-30"
>    ```

## Multiple parameter values {#query-multiple-values}

If you want to filter issues by multiple values for the same parameter, separate them with commas:

```no-highlight
parameter: "value1", "value2", " value3"
```

#### Example {#multiple-example}

> ```no-highlight
> author: "vpupkin","iivanov"
> ```
>
>This filter outputs all issues that were reported by `vpupkin` or `iivanov`.

## Filters with multiple conditions {#query-multiple-conditions}

You can combine multiple conditions in a single filter using Boolean operators:

- `AND`: The logical **AND** operator. Conditions combined with this operator must all be met at the same time.

    Example:

    ```no-highlight
    parameter1: "value1" AND parameter2: "value2"
    ```

    This query outputs the issues that have `parameter1` set to `value1` **and** `parameter2` set to `value2`.

    {% note info %}

    Instead of using the `AND` operator, you can just list the fields separated by a space.

    {% endnote %}

- `OR`: The logical **OR** operator. At least one of the conditions combined with this operator must be met.

    Example:

    ```no-highlight
    parameter1: "value1" OR parameter2: "value2"
    ```

    This query outputs the issues that have at least one of the conditions met: `parameter1` is set to `value1` **or** `parameter2` is set to `value2`.

You can create complex filters by combining multiple operators in a single query:

```no-highlight
parameter1: "value1" AND parameter2: "value2" OR parameter3: "value3"
```

When complex filters are processed, the `AND` operators are applied first. Use parentheses to change the order of actions:

```no-highlight
parameter1: "value1" AND (parameter2: "value2" OR parameter3: "value3")
```

## Searching by text {#query-text}

In addition to searching by parameters, you can also use the familiar text search. To do this, enter text in the query field and click **Apply**.

The search is performed across all the text fields in the issue: name, description, and comments.

* To search in only one of the fields, use the parameter to specify it:

    * `Summary`: The issue name.

    * `Description`: The issue description.

    * `Comment`: Text in comments.

    * `History`: Text in the history of changes.

    ```no-highlight
    Description: "Off with her head"
    ```

    This filter outputs all the issues that have a description containing the words and close forms of the words in the query.

* To only find issues with text that exactly matches the query text, use the `#` operator:

    ```no-highlight
    Summary: #"Version 2.0"
    ```

    This filter only returns issues whose name exactly matches the query text.

* To only find issues that don't have a particular text fragment in a given field, use the `!` operator:

    ```no-highlight
    Summary: !"UI"
    ```

    This filter only returns issues whose name doesn't contain a `UI` text fragment.

* To only find issues whose name doesn't exactly match the query text, use the `~` operator. This operator only applies to the `Summary` field:

    ```no-highlight
    Summary: ~"UI Update 2.0"
    ```

    This filter only returns issues whose name doesn't match the query text.

## Searching by user {#query-user}

You can search for issues by users' real names and usernames specified in issue fields. There are multiple ways to specify a real name or a username in your query:

* Putting the first and last name in quotation marks: `"first_name last_name"`. Used to search for an exact match with the user's first and last name.

    Example:

    ```no-highlight
    Author: "Alice Little"
    ```

    Entering this query will display all issues where the author is specified as Alice Little.

* Entering a username and putting `@` at the end: `login@`. Used to search for an exact match containing this username.

    Example:

    ```no-highlight
    Assignee: user3370@ 
    ```

    This query will display all issues that have `user3370` specified as the assignee.

* Entering a user's first name, last name, or username. Used for searching for exact matches containing either of those.

    Examples:

    * `Followers: Alice`. This query will display all issues followed by users with the first name Alice no matter what their last name is.

    * `Followers: alice`. This query will display all issues followed by the user with the username `alice@` or any user named Alice {% if locale == "ru" %}(if the name is in English){% endif %}.

## Searching by local field {#local_fields}

To specify the value of an [issue's local field](../local-fields.md) in a query, enter the key of the queue that the field is linked to and then the field name in English or Russian after a dot. If the field name is comprised of several words, specify the name in quotation marks. Examples:

```
DEVS.Tester: "Alice Little"
```

```
DEVS."Lead Tester": "Alice Little"
```

```
DEVS.tester: user3370@
```

## Date and time parameters {#query-date-time}

Many issue parameters have date and time values. The query language supports several formats for these parameters:

#### Date {#date}

* MM/DD/YYYY

    Example:

    ```
    04/30/2017
    ```

* DD.MM.YYYY

    Example:

    ```
    30.04.2017
    ```

* DD-MM-YYYY

    Example:

    ```
    30-04-2017
    ```

* YYYY-MM-DD

    Example:

    ```
    2017-04-30
    ```

#### Date and time {#date-time}

To specify the exact date and time, use this format:

```
"YYYY-MM-DD XXh:XXm:XXs"
```

Example:

```
"2017-04-30 17:25:00"
```

#### Time intervals {#time-intervals}

* You can set time intervals in weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds in the format:

    ```
    "XXw XXd XXh XXm XXs"
    ```

    For example, a time interval of 3 days, 5 hours, and 32 minutes can be written as:

    ```
    "3d 5h 32m"
    ```

* You can set intervals using valid date formats:

    ```
    DD-MM-YYYY .. DD-MM-YYYY
    ```

    Here's an example of a filter for issues that were created in a certain period of time:

    ```
    Created: 01-01-2017 .. 02-03-2017
    ```

* Time intervals can be set using [functions](#query-functions) as well as comparison, addition, and subtraction operations.

    Here is an example of a filter for issues created no earlier than eight days ago:

    ```
    Created: > today() - "1w 1d"
    ```

## Comparison operations {#query-compare}

In addition to looking for exact matches, the query language supports comparisons:

* **Not equal to**

    ```no-highlight
    parameter: !"value"
    ```

* **Greater than**, **Less than**, **Less than or equal to**, **Greater than or equal to**

    These operations are only applied to numeric parameters and date and time parameters.

    ```no-highlight
    parameter: >number
    parameter: <number
    parameter: >=number
    parameter: <=number
    ```

* **In the range**

    This operation is only applied to numeric parameters.

    ```no-highlight
    parameter: number1 .. number2
    ```

## Functions {#query-functions}

In addition to explicit parameter values, you can use functions. A function is a variable with a value that is calculated when the query is executed. For example, the function `today()` takes the value of today's date. To show all issues created today, use the query:

```no-highlight
Created: today()
```

| Function | Result | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| ```empty()  ``` | Empty value (parameter omitted) | Find issues that don't have an assignee:<br/>``` Assignee: empty() ``` |
| ```notEmpty() ``` | Any non-empty value (parameter set) | Find issues that have a deadline set:<br/>``` Deadline: notEmpty() ``` |
| ```me()  ``` | Name of the user executing the query | Find issues that you created:<br/>``` Author: me() ``` |
| ```now() ``` | Current time to the minute | Find issues created in the last 12 hours:<br/>``` Created: >now()-12h ``` |
| ```today() ``` | Time interval corresponding to the current date | Find issues created today:<br/>``` Created: today() ``` |
| ```week() ``` | Date range corresponding to the current week | Find issues created this week:<br/>``` Created: week() ``` |
| ```month()  ``` | Date range corresponding to the current month | Find issues created this month:<br/>``` Created: month() ``` |
| ```quarter()  ``` | Date range corresponding to the current quarter | Find issues created in this quarter:<br/>``` Created: quarter() ``` |
| ```year() ``` | Date range for the current year | Find issues created this year:<br/>``` Created: year() ``` |
| ```unresolved() ``` | No resolution | Find all issues that do not have a resolution set:<br/>``` Resolution: unresolved() ``` |
| ```group() ``` | List of department employees | Find issues that employees of the Sales department are working on:<br/>``` Assignee: group(value: "Sales department")  ``` |

## Searching by parameter change {#query-change}

If you know when and how a parameter was changed for an issue, you can create a filter for it:

```
"parameter": changed(from: "old value" to: "new value" by: "who changed" date: "when changed")
```

For example, to get a list of issues that user Alice Little switched to the <q>In progress</q> status in a certain period of time, you need to create a query:

```
Status: changed(to: "In progress" by: "Alice Little" date: 01.09.2017 .. 15.09.2017)
```

For example, to get a list of issues that user Alice Little switched to the <q>In progress</q> status over the last week, use a [function](#query-functions) in your query:

```
Status: changed(to: "In progress" by: "Alice Little" date: >today()-1w)>
```

## Sorting results {#query-result-sort}

You can sort filter results by setting the `"Sort By"` parameter at the end of the query. For the value, specify the name of the field to sort by:

```no-highlight
"Sort By": Created
```

If necessary, sort in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order:

```no-highlight
"Sort By": Created ASC
```

To specify multiple fields to sort by, separate them with commas in order of priority:

```no-highlight
"Sort By": Created ASC, Updated DESC
```

## Useful queries {#useful-queries}

Try a few ready-made queries to learn how they work:

* Active issues that you created:

    ```no-highlight
    Author: me() Resolution: empty()
    ```

* Active issues that you are assigned to:

    ```no-highlight
    Assignee: me() Resolution: empty()
    ```

* Active issues that you are following:

    ```no-highlight
    Followers: me() Resolution: empty()
    ```

* Issues that you are assigned to that have a deadline during the current week:

    ```no-highlight
    Assignee: me() Deadline: week()
    ```

* Issues with the **Critical** or **Blocker** priority for which you are the reporter, assignee, or follower.

    ```no-highlight
    (Followers: me() OR Assignee: me() OR Author: me()) AND Resolution: empty() AND Priority: Blocker, Critical
    ```
