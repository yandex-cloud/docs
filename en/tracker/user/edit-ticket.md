# Editing an issue

To edit an issue, go to the issue page. If you don't have access to edit the issue, [request permissions](../faq.md#section_xgr_zng_4bb) from the queue owner or {% if audience == "external" %}your company's{% endif %} admin.

{% note info %}

Issue pages are updated in real time. If someone edits or adds a comment to an issue that you have open in your browser, you will immediately see a notification on the browser tab.

{% list tabs %}

- Web interface

  To the right of the issue description, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-edit.png) and edit the text. Use [YFM markup](markup.md) to format text. Click **Save** to save your changes.

  If you close or refresh the page without saving your changes, the new description will still be stored in drafts. You can restore that description by clicking the edit icon ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-edit.png), clicking ![](../../_assets/tracker/drafts.png) in the toolbar, and choosing the draft.

  You can use the issue description to specify a key for a different issue so that {{ tracker-name }} automatically links the issues.

  {% if audience == "internal" %}
{% note info %}

  If you need to paste a link to another issue in your comment without actually linking the issues together, specify the `st:` parameter before the issue key (for example, `st:TEST-1234`). If you do this, a [magic link](wiki.md#magic-link-descr) will be displayed in the text field, but you won't link issues together.
You can disable automatic linking for issues from different queues in the [queue settings](../manager/edit-queue-general.md).
