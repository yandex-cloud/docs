# Working with an agile board

Issues are displayed on the board as cards with general issue parameters on them. You [can customize](../manager/edit-agile-board.md#sec_layout) the appearance of cards on the board by choosing fields to display or setting colors that appear when selecting tags and components.

{% note warning %}

The board only displays issues from the queues you have access to.

{% endnote %}

## Managing issues {#section_bgx_j21_2gb}

Managing issues on {{ tracker-name }} boards is like working with stickers on a real board:

- Issue cards are arranged into columns based on their status. To change the issue status, just drag it to the corresponding column.
- If you want to place a card somewhere else in the column, just drag it to the location you need (only applies to boards with [Allow changing the order of issues](../manager/edit-agile-board.md#board-settings) enabled).
- If you want to change issue options or leave a comment, click the key and make your changes in the issue card to the right.

## Create an issue {#section_mjn_3sg_2hb}

{% note warning %}

Make sure that the queue for creating issues in is specified in the [board settings](../manager/edit-agile-board.md#board-settings). The new issue will be created in the specified queue.

{% endnote %}

{{ tracker-name }} boards allow you to quickly create issues. You can create an issue directly in the sprint or place it in the backlog. You only need to specify an issue's name and type, as all the other fields can be filled in later.

## Adding issues to a board {#section_psd_wl4_vgb}

{% note warning %}

Your board will only display issues if their issue statuses are enabled in the board settings.

{% endnote %}

You can add issues with specific settings to your board automatically using [board filters](../manager/edit-agile-board.md#row_oqh_1j2_wgb). To add an issue to your board manually, create a new issue on the board from scratch, or add an issue to the backlog or a sprint.

#### Adding issues to a backlog

1. Open the issue page.

1. Click the title of the **Boards** field in the right-hand panel. If there's no **Boards** field, add it by clicking **Choose fields**.

1. Start typing the board's name in the **Boards** field and pick the option you need from the list that appears.

The issue will be placed on the board you've picked. To remove an issue from the board, clear the **Boards** field on the issue's page.

#### Adding issues to a sprint

1. Open the issue page.

1. Click the title of the **Sprint** field in the **Agile** panel on the right. If there's no **Sprint** field, add it by clicking **Choose fields**.

1. Start typing the sprint's name in the field and pick the option you need from the list that appears. The Boards field will be filled in automatically.

The issue on the board will be placed in the sprint you've picked. To remove an issue from the board, clear the **Boards** field on the issue's page.

#### Adding multiple issues

To add multiple issues to the board at once, use the [bulk change](../manager/bulk-change.md) feature:

1. Select the issues you need using [filters](../user/create-filter.md).

1. Choose the issues you want to add to the board and click **Edit fields**.

1. To add an issue to a backlog, start typing the backlog's name in the **Board** field and pick the option you need from the list that appears. If there's no **Board** field, add it by clicking **Choose fields**.

1. To add an issue to a sprint, start typing the sprint's name in the **Sprint** field and pick the option you need from the list that appears. The Boards field will be filled in automatically.

    If there's no **Sprint** field, add it by clicking **Choose fields**.

1. Click **Continue** and wait until your issues are processed.

## Adding notes to a board {#notes_add}

You can attach your own notes and comments to the columns on the board to make navigation easier for other users. Such notes can be freely edited by all users.

To attach a note to a column, do the following:

1. Open the board page.

1. Select  ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-dots.png) â†’ **Add note** at the top of the column.

1. Enter the text for your note. To format the text, use [YFM markup](markup.md).

1. Save the changes.

You can only attach one note to each individual column. It will show up at the top of the column, visible to all users.

## Filtering issues {#section_cxl_x31_2gb}

If there are too many issues on the board, you can always hide some of them using filters. You can apply multiple filters at once. Here is the list of available filters:

- By sprint. Use the upper panel to choose the sprint whose issues you want to view.

- By resolution. On the top panel, expand the **Resolution** menu and specify the resolutions you want to display on the board.

- By status. On the top panel, expand the **Status** menu and specify the statuses you want to display on the board.

- By issue key or name. Start typing an issue's key or name on the upper panel. Only the issues whose name or key contains your query will be displayed on the board.

- Quick Filters There are only two quick filters on the board by default: **Assigned to me** and **Reported by me**. To add new filters, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/edit-agile.png) on the filter panel.

## Fullscreen mode {#section_w2w_h1h_2hb}

You can switch the board to fullscreen mode. Cards are smaller in fullscreen mode, so more of them are displayed simultaneously. This mode is useful when planning or analyzing sprints.

To switch to fullscreen mode, open the board page and click ![](../../_assets/tracker/fullscreen-agile.png) next to the board's name.

To exit fullscreen mode, click **Exit fullscreen mode** in the bottom right corner of the page.

## Adding boards to Favorites {#section_nf5_r31_2gb}

You can add boards to Favorites for quicker access. Just go to a board's page and click ![](../../_assets/tracker/add-to-favorites.png) to the right of the board name. Your favorite boards are displayed in the **Boards** menu on the top panel in {{ tracker-name }}.
