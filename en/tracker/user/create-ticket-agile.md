If you use issue boards, it might be convenient for you to create issues right on the board you need. You can create an issue in particular sprint or place it in the backlog. You only need to specify an issue's name and type, as all the other fields can be filled in later.

1. Open the issue board.

1. Click **Add issue** in the lower-right corner.

1. Enter the issue's name and specify its type.

1. Click **Create**.

The created issue will be placed in the queue you specified in the [settings](../manager/edit-agile-board.md#section_ft1_3l3_3z). To view the issue, refresh the board page.
