# Working with issues

To open your issue list, in the left-hand menu, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/tasks.svg) **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_NavigationBar.issue-lists-menu-item }}** → **All my issues** or follow the [link]({{ link-tracker }}issues/my-issues). To get started with an issue, go to the issue's page.


## Starting work on an issue {#section_qpp_5rn_jz}

When getting started with an issue, change it to a new status (usually {{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.status.in.progress }}). The status shows what state the issue is in and helps other {{ tracker-name }} users track its progress. The current status is shown on the right panel.

When working on the issue, make sure to timely change the issue status so that's your colleagues and you are aware of its execution stage.

{% note tip %}

The available statuses and transitions depend on the [queue settings](../manager/workflow.md).

{% endnote %}

> Your issue has the <q>{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.status.open }}</q> status. When you start working on it, switch the status to <q>{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.status.in.progress }}</q>. When you finish, change the status to <q>{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.status.closed }}</q>. If you need to go back to the issue later, you can switch it back to <q>{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.status.open }}</q>.

## Working on an issue {#section_c3t_l53_d1b}

{{ tracker-name }} helps you keep track of an issue's progress and keep in touch with colleagues. When working on your issues, you can:

- [Create an issue checklist](checklist.md).
   Enumerate the steps needed to resolve the issue and tick off their execution.
- [Edit issue details](edit-ticket.md).
   If the issue description has changed, you can edit it.
- [Comment on issues](comments.md).
   Add comments to issues, make notes, and invite colleagues to comment.
- [Keep a record of time spent](time-spent.md).
   Register the time spent on the issue.

## Closing an issue {#section_kyj_gbm_2z}

When you finish working on an issue, switch it to a final status (usually <q>{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.status.closed }}</q>) and select a **resolution** (the reason the issue was closed). The available resolutions depend on the [queue settings](../manager/add-ticket-type.md).

> It was decided to cancel the issue you're working on. To register this in {{ tracker-name }}, switch the issue to the <q>{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.status.closed }}</q> status and select the <q>Canceled</q> resolution.
