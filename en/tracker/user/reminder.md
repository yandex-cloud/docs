# Setting up an issue reminder

{{ tracker-name }} can send issue reminders. You can send reminders to yourself or other users. Only the sender and the recipient will be able to see the reminder.

## Creating a reminder {#section_ct4_trk_t2b}

To set up a reminder:

1. Open the issue page.

1. Tap ![](../../_assets/tracker/reminder2.png).

1. Click **Add reminder**.

1. Enter the date and time for the reminder.

1. Specify the recipient of the reminder. Start typing the user's name or login and choose one of the suggested options.

   A reminder can only have one recipient. If you want to send a reminder to several users, you have to create an individual reminder for each of them.

1. To send an issue reminder regardless of the issue status, select **Even if resolved**.

1. If necessary, enter a comment. The user will receive it with the reminder.

1. Click **Save**.

{{ tracker-name }} will send an email to the user at the time specified, and a pop-up reminder will appear on the issue page.
