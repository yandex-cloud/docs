   * To open all the issues available to you in {{ tracker-name }}, at the bottom of the window, click **All issues** or follow the [direct link]({{ link-tracker }}).

To search for issues in the list, use [quick filters](#q-filters) or [add search criteria](default-filters.md#add-condition).

   * **Favorite issues**.
   * **All my issues**.
   * **Reported by me**.
   * **Assigned to me**.
   * **Followed by me**.
   * **Waiting for response**.
   * **Deadline approaching**.

* To filter issues by their [resolution](../manager/create-resolution.md), click **Resolution** and select relevant values from the list.

* To use the [advanced search parameters](./default-filters.md#add-condition), click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/add-filter.svg) **Add a field for filtering** and select a field.

1. In the **Search by name, description, comments** field, enter the text to find.

The system will search for issues that match all the selected filters.
