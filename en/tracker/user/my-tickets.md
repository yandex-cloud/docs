# My issues

To find issues you're working on:

1. In the left panel, open ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/tasks.svg) **Issues**.

1. To find the issues in which you are the reporter, assignee, or follower, select the **All my issues** filter.

1. If you cannot see all relevant issues, expand the list:

   * On the left panel at the bottom of the page, click **Full list of filtered issues** or follow the [direct link]({{ link-tracker }}issues/my-issues).

   * To open all the issues available to you in {{ tracker-name }}, at the bottom of the window, click **All issues** or follow the [direct link]({{ link-tracker }}).

To search for issues in the list, use [filtering by parameters](#q-filters) or [add search criteria](default-filters.md#add-condition).

## Filter by parameters {#q-filters}

Use filters to narrow down your issue list and display only those issues that match the selected parameters. The filter by parameters buttons are above the issue list:

* To use standard filters, click the filter name in the list located in the bottom-left corner of the page:
   * **Favorite issues**.
   * **All my issues**.
   * **Reported by me**.
   * **Assigned to me**.
   * **Followed by me**.
   * **Waiting for response**.
   * **Deadline approaching**.

* To filter issues by their [resolution](../manager/create-resolution.md), click **Resolution** and select relevant values from the list.

* To use the [advanced search parameters](./default-filters.md#add-condition), click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/add-filter.svg) **Add a field for filtering** and select a field.

## Searching for issues by name {#search-name}

If you want to find an issue using its name:

1. In the left panel, open ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/tasks.svg) **Issues** or click the [link]({{ link-tracker }}issues/).

1. In the **Search by name, description, comments** field, enter the text to find.

The system will search for issues that match all the selected filters.

## Configuring how issues are displayed {#manage-list}
