# How to share a dashboard

You can share your dashboard with colleagues:

1. Open the dashboard page.

1. Copy the dashboard address and send it to the person you want to share it with.

By default, any dashboard can be viewed by all users, but you can restrict access to the dashboard.

{% note tip %}

If someone shares a dashboard with you, [add it to your Favorites](favourites.md#section_vj1_rdj_nz) so that you can always find it easily.

{% endnote %}

## How to restrict access to a dashboard {#section_k2z_1nk_pz}

If you want to restrict users&apos; access to your dashboard, you can change access settings:

1. Open the dashboard page.

1. Select ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Edit access control** to the left of the dashboard name.

1. Set permissions to **Read**, **Write**, and **Grant** for the user categories:

    - **Users and robots**: Individual settings for individual users. To add a user to this category, enter the login or the user's name in the search bar at the top of the table.

    - **Groups**: Settings for departments and teams. To add a new department, enter its name in the search bar at the top of the table.

        {% note tip %}

        To add all company employees, select the `All employees` group.

        {% endnote %}

    - **Roles**: Settings for users who have specific roles for the dashboard:

        - **Owner**: The dashboard owner. By default, the owner is the person who created the dashboard, and only the owner has **Write** and **Grant** permissions.

            {% note alert %}

            Try not to change the access settings for the dashboard owner unless necessary. If you accidentally revoked grant permissions for the owner, contactyour organization's administrator.

            {% endnote %}

1. Click **Apply**.
