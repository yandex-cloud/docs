# Shared access to dashboards

You can share your dashboard with your colleagues:

1. Open the dashboard page.

1. Copy the dashboard's URL and send it to the user you want to share it with.

By default, any user has read access to any dashboard.

{% note tip %}

If someone shares a dashboard with you, add it to Favorites so that you can always find it easily. To do this, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/favourites.svg) to the right of the dashboard name. Your favorite dashboards are available in the **Dashboards** menu on the {{ tracker-name }} top panel.

{% endnote %}

The dashboard owner can only be changed by the current owner. Once the owner is changed, you won't have permission to edit the dashboard.

To change the dashboard owner:

1. Open the dashboard page.

1. To the left of the dashboard name, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Edit access control**.

1. Under **Change owner**, enter a new owner's name.

1. Click **Apply**.
