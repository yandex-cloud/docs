# Dashboards

_Dashboards_ let you track the status of important issues on a single page. You can arrange [widgets](widgets.md) on your dashboard to display useful information. They can show lists of issues, statistics on issue completion, pivot tables, or notes.

Widget content is generated automatically. The list of issues that a widget is based on is set using [filters](create-filter.md). You can go to [{#T}](../support-process-dashboards.md) to find sample widgets for the support service dashboard.

{% note warning %}

Issues that you don't have access to will not show up on the dashboard.

{% endnote %}

You can create multiple dashboards with different sets of widgets and switch between them as necessary. You can make any of your dashboards your [home page](startpage-dashboard.md) or [share](share-dashboard.md) it with a coworker.
