# Dashboards

_Dashboards_ let you track the status of important issues on a single page. You can arrange [widgets](widgets.md) on your dashboard to display useful information. They can show issue lists, statistics on issue completion, pivot tables, or notes.

Widget content is generated automatically. The list of issues used to form a widget is set using [filters](create-filter.md). You can go to [{#T}](../support-process-dashboards.md) to find sample widgets for the support service dashboard.

{% note warning %}

Issues that you don't have access to will not show up on the dashboard.

{% endnote %}

You can create multiple dashboards with different sets of widgets and switch between them as necessary. You can make any of your dashboards your [home page](startpage-dashboard.md) or [share](share-dashboard.md) it with a coworker.
