# Finding my issues

To find issues you're working on, use the preset _system filters_. Filters let you view issues that list you as the assignee, reporter, and so on. To search for issues in the list, use [quick filters](#quick-filters) or [add a search parameter](#add-condition).

## Use system filters {#sys_filters}

To find issues you're responsible for, on the top panel in {{ tracker-name }}, click **Issues** â†’ **My issues** and choose one of the filters:

- **My issues**: Issues that list you as the reporter, assignee, or follower.

- **Favorite issues**: Issues that you [added to Favorites](favourites.md#section_thz_1n5_jz).

- **Reported by me**: Issues that you created.

- **Assigned to me**: Issues that list you as the assignee.

- **Followed by me**: Issues that you [subscribed](subscribe.md#section_xt5_xrv_jz) to for updates.

- **Pending reply**: Issues you were [invited to comment on](comments.md#section_nl2_1qv_tz).

You will find the issues you selected on the filter page. You can add filter parameters, configure the list's appearance, or download the list as a file:

- To search for issues in the list, use [quick filters](#quick-filters) or [add a search parameter](#add-condition).

- If you want to hide or display certain issue fields, click **Configure columns**, select the fields, and click **Save**.

- To group issues by a certain field, click **Not grouped** to the right of the list and select the field.

- If you want to create a [Gantt chart](../manager/gantt.md) for your issue list, in the upper-right corner, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/gantt-ico.png) .

- To save the issue list, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-download.png) to the right above the list and select the format of the file to download or simply copy the list to the clipboard.

- To collapse the left-side panel with the filter list, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/button-collapse.png) at the top of the panel.

## Quick filters {#quick-filters}

You can use quick filters to filter out your issue list, leaving only the issues that include the selected parameters. Quick filter buttons are located above the issue list:

* Resolution filters. Select one of the options:

    - **All**: The page displays all issues, regardless of the resolution.

    - **Without resolution**: The page only displays issues that aren't resolved.

    - **With resolution**: The page only displays resolved issues.

* Role-based filters. You can apply multiple filters at the same time:

    - **Reported by me**.

    - **Assigned to me**.

    - **Followed by me**.

As a result, only the issues that meet the selected filter parameters are shown in the list.

## Adding search parameters {#add-condition}

#### Searching by parameter

Some parameters can't be added to quick filters, but you can specify them in your search:

1. Click **Add condition** above the issue list.

1. Select an issue parameter and set its value.

    All issues that don't meet your criteria are filtered out of the list.

    {% if audience == "internal" %}

    {% note info %}

    [Local fields](../local-fields.md) can only be selected if the search criteria specify the queue that the field is linked to.

    {% endnote %}

    {% endif %}

1. You can add multiple parameters for a more thorough search.

1. You can reset the search parameters by clicking **Reset**.

For example, you can search for issues by name or description:

- To find issues that contain a particular phrase in their name, add the **Issue** parameter to your search and enter the text to search for.

- To find issues that contain a particular phrase in their description, add the **Description** parameter to your search and enter the text to search for.

{% note info %}

If you define multiple parameters, only issues that contain all of them are found.

{% endnote %}

#### Query language

If you can't add certain issue parameters to your search, use a query:

1. Click **Query language** in the upper-right corner. All search parameters specified in issue fields and quick filters are displayed in the query field.

1. Use the [query language](query-filter.md) to add parameters.

1. Click **Apply**.

    All issues that don't meet your criteria are filtered out of the list.

#### Save filters

You can use search parameters as a template for creating filters. To do this, click **Save filter as** and enter a name for the filter. The saved filter then appears in the list in the left panel.
