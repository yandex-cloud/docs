# Searching for my issues

To find the issues you're working on, use the _system filters_ preset. Filters let you view issues that list you as the assignee, reporter, and so on. To search for issues in the list, use [quick filters](#quick-filters) or [add search criteria](#add-condition).

## Using system filters {#sys_filters}

Find your issues using preset system filters:

{% list tabs %}

- Web interface

  On the top panel in {{ tracker-name }}, click **Issues** â†’ **My issues** and choose one of the options:

  * **My issues**: Issues that list you as the reporter, assignee, or follower.

  * **Favorite issues**: Issues that you [added to Favorites](favourites.md#section_thz_1n5_jz).

  * **Reported by me**: Issues that you created.

  * **Assigned to me**: Issues that list you as the assignee.

  * **Followed by me**: Issues that you [subscribed to](subscribe.md#section_xt5_xrv_jz) for updates.

  * **Needs response**: Issues you were [invited to comment on](comments.md#call-comment).

  You will find the issues you selected on the filter page. You can add filter parameters, configure the list's appearance, or download the list as a file:

  * To search for issues in the list, use [quick filters](#quick-filters) or [add search criteria](#add-condition).

  * If you want to hide or display certain issue fields, click **Configure columns**, select the fields, and click **Save**.

  * To group issues by a certain field, click **No grouping** to the right of the list and select the desired field.

  * To create a [Gantt chart](../manager/gantt.md) for your issue list, in the upper-right corner, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/gantt-ico.png).

  * To save an issue list, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-download.png) to the right above the list and select the format of the file to download or simply copy the list to the clipboard.

  * To collapse the left-side panel with the filter list, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/button-collapse.png) at the top of the panel.

- Mobile app

  In the upper-left corner, tap the name of the filter and choose one of the options:

    * **My issues**: Issues that list you as the reporter, assignee, or follower.

    * **Reported by me**: Issues that you created.

    * **Assigned to me**: Issues that list you as the assignee.

    * **Followed by me**: Issues that you [subscribed to](subscribe.md#section_xt5_xrv_jz) for updates.

    * **Favorite issues**: Issues that you [added to Favorites](favourites.md#section_thz_1n5_jz).

    * **Waiting for my response**: Issues you were [invited to comment on](comments.md#call-comment).

    * **Deadline approaching**: Issues that list you as the reporter, assignee, or follower and where:

      * The deadline passed in the last two weeks ![](../../_assets/tracker/deadline-red.png).

      * The deadline will pass in the next three months ![](../../_assets/tracker/deadline-grey.png).

  To display both open and completed issues in the list, enable **Show completed issues** in the filter panel.

  After selecting the filter, you'll see the selected issue list.

{% endlist %}

## Quick filters {#quick-filters}

{% note info %}

Quick filters are only available in the {{ tracker-name }} web interface.

{% endnote %}

You can use quick filters to filter out your issue list, leaving only the issues that include the selected parameters. Quick filter buttons are located above the issue list:

![image](../../_assets/tracker/quick-filters-new.png)

* Resolution filters. Select one of the options:

    * **All**: The page displays all issues, regardless of the resolution.

    * **Without resolution**: The page only displays issues that aren't resolved.

    * **With resolution**: The page only displays resolved issues.

* Role-based filters. You can apply multiple filters at the same time:

    * **Reported by me**

    * **Assigned to me**

    * **Followed by me**

As a result, only the issues that meet the selected filter criteria are shown in the list.

## Adding search parameters {#add-condition}

{% note info %}

You can only set the search criteria in the {{ tracker-name }} web interface.

{% endnote %}

#### Searching by parameter

Some parameters can't be added to quick filters, but you can specify them in your search:

1. Click **Add condition** above the issue list.

1. Select an issue parameter and set its value.

    All issues that don't meet your criteria are filtered out of the list.

    {% if audience == "internal" %}

    {% note info %}

    [A local issue field](../local-fields.md) can only be selected if the queue that the field is linked to is specified in the search criteria.

    {% endnote %}

    {% endif %}

1. You can add multiple parameters for a more thorough search.

1. You can reset the search parameters by clicking **Reset** above the issue list.

For example, you can search for issues by name or description:

* To find issues that contain a particular phrase in their name, add the **Issue** parameter to your search and enter the text to search for.

* To find issues that contain a particular phrase in their description, add the **Description** parameter to your search and enter the text to search for.

![](../../_assets/tracker/filters-condition.png)

{% note info %}

If you define multiple parameters, only issues that contain all of them are found.

{% endnote %}

#### Query language

If you can't add certain issue parameters to your search, use a query:

1. Click **Query language** in the upper-right corner. All search parameters specified in issue fields and quick filters are displayed in the query field.

1. Use the [query language](query-filter.md) to add parameters.

1. Click **Apply**.

    All issues that don't meet your criteria are filtered out of the list.

#### Saving filters

You can use search parameters as a template for creating filters. To do this, click **Save filter as** and name the filter. The saved filter then appears in the list in the left panel.
