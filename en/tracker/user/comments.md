# Adding comments to issues

You can use comments to leave notes about progress, ask for additional information, or ask colleagues to join the discussion.

{% note tip %}

If you keep all your discussions about an issue in the comments section, you will always have access to the full history of what was discussed.

{% endnote %}

## Leaving a comment {#leave-comment}

{% list tabs %}

- Web interface

    To comment on an issue, enter your text in the box at the bottom of the page and click **Submit**. You can use [markup](markup.md) in the comments section and attach images and files.

    You can use the comments section to specify a key for a different issue so that {{ tracker-name }} automatically links the issue.

    {% if audience=="internal" %}

    {% note info %}

    If you need to paste a link to another issue in your comment without actually linking the issues together, specify the `st:` parameter before the issue key (for example, `st:TEST-1234`). If you do this, a [magic link](wiki.md#magic-link-descr) will be displayed in the text field, but you won't link issues together.
You can disable automatic linking for issues from different queues in the [queue settings](../manager/edit-queue-general.md).

    {% endnote %}

    {% endif %}

    If you close or refresh the page without sending your comment, it is still stored in drafts. You can restore the comment text by clicking ![](../../_assets/tracker/drafts.png) in the toolbar above the comment box and choosing the draft.

- Mobile app

    You can use the comments section to specify a key for a different issue so that {{ tracker-name }} automatically [links](ticket-links.md#add-link) the issue.
