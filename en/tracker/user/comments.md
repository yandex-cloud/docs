# Add comments to issues

You can use comments to leave notes about progress, ask for additional information, or ask colleagues to join the discussion.

{% note tip %}

If you keep all your discussions about an issue in the comments section, you will always have access to the full history of what was discussed.

{% endnote %}

## Leave a comment {#section_c5n_vlv_tz}

To comment on an issue, enter text in the box at the bottom of the page. In the comments section, you can use [wiki markup](wiki-markup.md) and attach images and files.

You can use the comments section to specify a key for a different issue. {{ tracker-name }} will then link the issue automatically.

{% note info %}

If you need to paste a link to another issue in your comment without actually linking the issues together, include the `st:` parameter before the issue key (for example: `st:TEST-1234`). If you do this, a [magic link](wiki.md#magic-link-descr) will be displayed in the text field, but you won't link issues together.
You can disable automatic linking for issues from different queues in the [queue settings](../manager/edit-queue-general.md).

{% endnote %}

If you close or refresh the page without sending your comment, it is still stored in drafts. You can restore the comment text by clicking ![](../../_assets/tracker/drafts.png) in the toolbar above the comment box and choosing the draft.

        You can set up a **Nickname** to communicate with outside users. Create one or more nicknames in the [queue email address](../manager/queue-mail.md) settings.

        The <q>From</q> field will display your name and address.
