# Overview

{% note warning %}

Only an [administrator](../role-model.md) can connect repositories.

{% endnote %}

Connecting your repositories to {{ tracker-name }} enables you to link commits to issues. You can connect any number of repositories hosted on the following services:

* [Bitbucket](bitbucket.md#repo)
* [GitHub](github.md#repo)
* [GitLab](gitlab.md#repo)

You can also connect your own [Bitbucket](bitbucket.md#on-premise), [GitHub](github.md#on-premise), or [GitLab](gitlab.md#on-premise) server to {{ tracker-name }}. In this case, all repositories that a token has access to will be connected to {{ tracker-name }}.
