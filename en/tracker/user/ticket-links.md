# Editing issue links

You can link issues to other issues to group multiple issues based on a common topic or set the issue hierarchy.

The number of links to an issue is unlimited. The list of related issues is shown under the issue description.

You can also link issues and [repository commits](#section_commit).

Issue links are created automatically when an issue key is entered into the issue's description or comment body.
