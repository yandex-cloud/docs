# List of queue issues

Each issue in {{ tracker-name }} belongs to a [queue](../queue-intro.md). Issues with a common topic are usually put in the same queue. They might be issues for a specific project, department, or team.

To view all the issues in a queue, open the queue page:

1. Select **Queues** → **All queues** on the top panel in {{ tracker-name }}.

1. Click the name of the desired queue.

By default, the queue page only displays active issues (the **Without resolution** option). You can customize which issues to display by using the [quick filter](../manager/quick-filters.md) buttons above the list of issues.
