# Personal settings

You can manage your issues more easily by adjusting the {{ tracker-name }} interface.

## Customizing your home page {#sec_my_page}

You can set {% if audience == "external" %}your [home page](startpage.md){% else %}the [**My page** tab](startpage.md){% endif %} to display any [filter](create-filter.md), [dashboard](dashboard.md), or [issue board](../manager/create-agile-board.md):

1. {% include [open-personal-settings](../../_includes/tracker/open-personal-settings.md) %}

1. Under **My page**, choose the filter, dashboard, or issue board you want to see on the home page.

1. Click **Save**.

## Setting the interface language {#choose-language}

You can use {{ tracker-name }} in English or Russian. To do this:

1. {% include [open-personal-settings](../../_includes/tracker/open-personal-settings.md) %}

1. Under **Interface language**, choose the desired language.

1. Click **Save**.

## Setting the user display type {#sec_display}

By default, the **Author**, **Assignee**, and **Followers** fields display the users' first and last names. If you want to display their usernames or profile pictures instead, change the user display mode.

    - Select **Show avatars instead of names** to display profile pictures instead of names and usernames in the **Followers** field.

        {% endcut %}

1. Click **Save**.

## Setting the date display format {#sec_display_date}

Values responsible for date and time can be displayed in the full (day, month, year, time) or simplified (day and month) formats.

If you want to change the display type for these values, do the following:

1. {% include [open-personal-settings](../../_includes/tracker/open-personal-settings.md) %}

1. Under **Date format**, select the desired format.

1. Click **Save**.

## Configuring notifications {#sec_notifications}

{{ tracker-name }} notifies you of any updates to issues you're subscribed to. You can change your notification settings on the personal settings page:

1. {% include [open-personal-settings](../../_includes/tracker/open-personal-settings.md) %}

1. Set your notification settings:
    - Enable or disable [regular update reports for issues you're subscribed to](notification-digest.md).
