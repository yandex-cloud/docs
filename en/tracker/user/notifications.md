# Notifications and subscriptions

By default, {{ tracker-name }} sends you notifications about changes to issues if you have one of these roles:

- **Reporter**: You created this issue.
- **Assignee**: You are assigned to this issue.
- **Follower**: You are subscribed to notifications for this issue.
- **Queue/version/component subscriber**: You are subscribed to notifications for the queue or component that the issue belongs to.

Notifications contain information about any changes to issues and are sent to the mailbox linked to your account.

If the standard rules for sending notifications do not suit you, you can change them:

- [{#T}](subscribe.md)
- [Receive regular update digests](notification-digest.md)
- [Set up a list of events and roles you want to be notified about](notification-settings.md)
- [Subscribe other users to issue, component, or version updates](../manager/subscriptions.md)
{% if audience == "draft" %}- [Send notifications to mailboxes in your domain](../manager/mail-notifications.md){% endif %}
