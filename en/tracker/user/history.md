# Viewing issue change history

## Viewing the history of changes {#show-history}

Any changes to an issue are saved in the **History**. To view issue change history:

1. Open the issue page.

1. To the right of the **Activity** section, click the **Comments** list (selected by default) and select **History**.

The change history saves:

* Names of the saved parameters.
* Parameter values before and after the change.
* Names of change authors.
* Date and time when the changes were made.

## Sorting entries {#change-order}

Entries in the change history are ordered chronologically by default.

To change the order of entries, to the right of the **Activity** section, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/new-first.svg) **Newest first**.

The issue comments will also get reordered.
