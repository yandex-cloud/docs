# Creating an issue from a form

In [Yandex.Forms]({{ link-forms }}), you can set up integration with {{ tracker-name }} to automatically create issues using data from forms.

You can post your forms on websites or add them to websites and wiki pages. Using these forms, even users without access to {{ tracker-name }} can create issues on their own. Forms make it much more convenient to [process user requests sent to the support team](../support-process-mail-forms.md) or collect support requests.

If you want to use a form as a template for quickly creating standardized issues, [embed the form on the issue creation page in {{ tracker-name }}](../manager/attach-form.md).

To learn more about integration with Yandex.Forms, see [{#T}](../manager/forms-integration.md).
