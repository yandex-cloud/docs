# Creating an issue from a form

You can create issues automatically based on information taken from [{{ forms-full-name }}]({{ link-forms }}) by setting up integration with {{ tracker-name }}.

Here is how you can use forms to create issues:

- The form is posted as a direct link, hosted on a website or on {{ wiki-full-name }}.

  If this is the case, simply fill in and submit the form. The information you enter will be used when compiling the issue.

  Using such forms, even users without access to {{ tracker-name }} can create issues on their own. Forms make it much more convenient to [process user requests sent to the support team](../support-process-mail-forms.md) or collect support requests.

- The form is [linked to a queue in {{ tracker-name }}](../manager/attach-form.md) as a quick issue template.

  If this is the case, go to the queue page and click **Create issue**. Select your form and fill it in. The information you enter will be used when compiling the issue.

For more information about integration with {{ forms-full-name }}, see [{#T}](../manager/forms-integration.md).
