# Getting access to an issue

Access permissions for issues are determined by the [queue settings](../manager/queue-access.md).

If you do not have sufficient rights to access the queue page and its issues, contact the queue owner {% if audience == "external" %} or [your organization's admin](../role-model.md){% endif %}. The queue owner's name is usually mentioned in the access restriction message.

If you can access the queue page but some of the issues remain inaccessible, these issues may include [components with limited access](../manager/queue-access.md#section_tbh_cs5_qbb). If this is the case, please contact the queue owner.
