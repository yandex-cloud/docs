# Get access to an issue

Access permissions for issues are determined by the [queue settings](../manager/queue-access.md).

If you don't have sufficient rights to access the queue page and its issues, contact the queue owneror your organization's administrator. The queue owner's name is usually mentioned in the access restriction message.

If you can access the queue page but some issues remain inaccessible, they may include [components with limited access](../manager/queue-access.md#section_tbh_cs5_qbb). If this is the case, please contact the queue owner.
