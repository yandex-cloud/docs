# Deleting an issue

An issue can't be deleted in {{ tracker-name }}. If you created an issue by accident or want to cancel it due to a change of plans, simply close the issue with the appropriate resolution.

For example, duplicate issues can be closed with the <q>Duplicate</q> resolution, while issues created by mistake can be closed with the <q>Canceled</q> resolution. For more information about how to close issues, see [Working with issues](ticket-in-progress.md#section_kyj_gbm_2z).

You can also hide an unnecessary issue from search results and dashboards by clearing the **Assignee** field, deleting its links to other issues, and so on.

{% note tip %}

You can [delete a queue](../manager/delete-queue.md) and all issues in it. [Move](move-ticket.md) the issues you don't need to a special queue and then delete it.

{% endnote %}
