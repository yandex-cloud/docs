# Deleting an issue

An issue can't be deleted in {{ tracker-name }}. If you created an issue by accident or want to cancel it due to a change of plans, simply close the issue with the appropriate resolution.

For example, if two issues copy each other, one of them can be closed with the "Duplicate" resolution, while issues created by mistake can be closed with the "Cancelled" resolution. For more information about closing issues, see [Working with issues](ticket-in-progress.md#section_kyj_gbm_2z).

You can also hide an unnecessary issue from search results and dashboards by clearing the **Assignee** field, deleting its links to other issues, and so on.

{% note tip %}

You can [delete a queue](../manager/delete-queue.md) and all issues in it. [Move](edit-ticket.md#section_xwx_qpn_jz) the issues you don't need to a special queue and then delete it.
