# Receiving update reports

To regularly receive reports for issues you're subscribed to via email:

1. {% include [open-personal-settings](../../_includes/tracker/open-personal-settings.md) %}

1. Enable **Receive issue update digest** and choose how often you'd like to receive updates.

1. Click **Save**.

The repot contains a list of issues that were changed during the selected period. You can also [specify what changes](notification-settings.md) to include in the report.
