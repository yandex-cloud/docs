# Attaching images and files to an issue

You can attach multiple files in any format to an issue. The maximum size of a single file is 128 MB.
The files that you add in {{ tracker-name }} don't consume space on Yandex&#160;Disk. {{ tracker-name }} doesn't restrict the amount of stored data.

To attach a file to an issue description, use one of the methods:

* Click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/icon-file.svg) **Attaching files** under the issue description.

* Drag files to the issue description.

* To attach an image, in the comment field on the toolbar, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/text-edit/image.svg). Then, add the image URL or upload it from your device.

You can similarly attach a file to a comment.

The list of all files attached to the issue page is shown under the issue description.
