# Adding issue fields

## Standard issue fields {#section_ymd_ycj_1gb}

The most popular issue fields (settings) are available in {{ tracker-name }} by default. You can see the list of existing fields on the [{{ tracker-name }} settings]({{ link-admin-fields }}) page.

If the field you need is missing, you can [create a new one in your queue](create-param.md#section_local_field). If you want to add a field that will be available in all {{ tracker-name }} queues, {% if audience == "external" %}your organization's administrator can [create a global field](create-param.md#section_global_field){% else %}submit a request to create a global field using [this form](create-param.md#section_global_field){% endif %}.

## Adding a local field {#section_local_field}

If you need to add a new issue field that is not available in {{ tracker-name }}, you can add local fields to your queue.

A local field can only be used in the issues of the queue it's linked to. The advantage of local fields is that the queue owner can manage them without the risk of affecting the workflows in other queues. Users working in other queues won't see this field in their issues.

To learn more about creating and using local fields, see [Local issue fields](../local-fields.md).

{% note alert %}

Local fields are temporarily not supported in certain cases. They will be implemented later. To learn more, see [Local field constraints](../local-fields.md#restrictions).

{% endnote %}

## Adding a global field {#section_global_field}

{% if audience == "external" %}

{% note alert %}

Only your organization's administrator can add global issue fields.

{% endnote %}

To add a new issue field (parameter):

1. Make sure that you are logged in as an administrator.

1. On the {{ tracker-name }} top panel, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) â†’ **Configure {{ tracker-name }}**.

1. Go to the **Fields** tab.

1. Click **Create field**.

1. Select the field type and click **Continue**.

1. Set parameters for the new field:

    - **Category**. All {{ tracker-name }} fields are grouped into categories. Select the category that best suits the new field.

    - **Name**. Try to give the fields short and informative names.

    - **Name in English**. This name is shown in the English interface of {{ tracker-name }}.

    - **Type of number** (only for fields with the <q>number</q> type).

    - **List items** (only for fields with the <q>drop-down list</q> type). Specify the possible values and their order.

    - **Number of list items** (only for fields with the <q>drop-down list</q> type).

{% else %}

If you need to create a new issue field, consider [adding a local field](../local-fields.md) linked to a specific queue. You should only create a global field if a local field is not suitable for some reason.

To add a new global issue field, order it using [this form](https://forms.yandex-team.ru/surveys/66769/). Requests are reviewed within 2-3 business days. If the issue is urgent, set its priority to <q>critical</q> and provide a comment as to why it's urgent.
