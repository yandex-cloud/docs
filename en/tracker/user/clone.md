# How to clone an issue

You can use cloning to create new issues based on existing ones. You can clone issues in any queue that is available to you.

{% note tip %}

If you need to create similar issues on a regular basis, use [templates](ticket-template.md).

{% endnote %}

To clone an issue:

1. Open the issue page.

1. Choose  **Actions** â†’ **Clone issue**.

1. Fill in the fields:

    - **Clone in**: Select the queue where you want to create the cloned issue.

    - **Copy issue fields**: Select this option to keep the same issue parameters after cloning. If some of the settings are not available in the target queue (for example, versions or components), they will be left empty.

        {% note warning %}

        If the issue has values entered for [local fields](../local-fields.md), they will be deleted when the issued is cloned to another queue.

        {% endnote %}

    - **Link the cloned issue**: Select this option to link the issue and its clone.

    - **Issue name**: The same issue name is used by default, but you can change it.

    - **Type**: Select the type of issue. The issue types available depend on the target queue settings.

    - **Status**: Select the issue status. The available issue statuses depend on the settings of the target queue for the selected issue type.

    - **Assignee** and **Followers**: These settings are preserved by default, but you can change them.

1. Click **Clone**.
