# Cloning an issue

You can use cloning to create new issues based on existing ones. You can clone issues in any queue that is available to you.

If you need to create similar issues on a regular basis, use [templates](ticket-template.md).

To clone an issue:

1. Select **Actions** â†’ **Clone issue**.

1. Fill in the fields:

    - **Clone in**: Select the queue to create a cloned issue in.

        If the issue has the [local field](../local-fields.md) values specified, they will be reset when cloning the issue to a different queue.

        {% endnote %}
