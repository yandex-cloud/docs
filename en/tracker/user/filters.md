# Find issues

You can use the search box in the top panel in {{ tracker-name }} to find issues by their key or name.

You can use filters to search for issues by parameters.


You can use filters to:

- [Find issues you're working on.](default-filters.md)

- [Find issues in queues.](../manager/quick-filters.md)

- [Set your own search parameters and save them as a preset filter.](create-filter.md)

    You can use your saved filters to pick issues for [dashboards](dashboard.md) and [agile boards](../manager/create-agile-board.md).
