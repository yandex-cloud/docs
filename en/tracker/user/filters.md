You can use filters to:

* [Find the issues you're working on.](default-filters.md)

* [Find issues in a queue.](../manager/quick-filters.md)

* [Set your own search criteria and save them as a preset filter.](create-filter.md)

    You can use your saved filters to pick issues for [dashboards](dashboard.md) and [agile boards](../manager/create-agile-board.md).
