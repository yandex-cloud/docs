# Subscribing to notifications

Subscriptions keep you from missing changes to issues that are important for you. If someone edits an issue that you have subscribed to, you receive an email notification.

You can subscribe to a specific issue, or to all issues related to a particular queue, version, or component.

You can [configure your notifications and subscriptions](notification-settings.md) so that you only receive updates about events you're interested in.

## Subscribing to an issue {#section_xt5_xrv_jz}

If you want to be notified of changes to a specific issue, subscribe to it:

1. Open the issue page.

1. On the right-hand panel in the **Followers** field, click **Add me**. If you don't see the **Followers** field, add it by clicking ![](../../_assets/tracker/task-params-btn.png).

If you did everything correctly, your name will appear in the followers field. Now you will receive emails with notifications of any changes to this issue.

{% note info %}

You can also add other users to the list of followers. To do this, click on the word **Followers** and enter the login or name of the user.

{% endnote %}

## Subscribing to a queue {#section_k13_z5v_jz}

Subscribe to changes to a queue to track changes to all of the issues in the queue:

1. Open the [queue page](queue.md).

1. Select:
    - ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Subscribe to new issues** to get notifications about new issues created in the queue. You'll also be subscribed to notifications about all the events specified in the [notification settings](user-notifications.md#sec_add_role) for the **Queue subscriber** role.
    - ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Subscribe to all notifications** to get notifications of any changes to issues in the queue.

You can also [select events](user-subscriptions.md) to be notified about.

{% note tip %}

If the **Subscriptions** tab doesn't allow changing the list of events, go to the **Notifications** tab. You can [edit](user-notifications.md) the events in the section for the **Queue subscriber** role.
