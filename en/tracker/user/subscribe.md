# Subscribing to notifications

Subscriptions keep you from missing changes to issues that are important for you. If someone edits an issue that you have subscribed to, you receive an email notification.

You can subscribe to a specific issue, or to all issues related to a particular queue, version, or component.

You can [configure your notifications and subscriptions](notification-settings.md) so that you only receive updates about events you're interested in.

## Subscribing to an issue {#section_xt5_xrv_jz}

If you want to be notified of changes to a specific issue, subscribe to it:

1. Open the issue page.

1. On the right-hand panel in the **Followers** field, click **Add me**. If you don't see the **Followers** field, add it by clicking ![](../../_assets/tracker/task-params-btn.png).

If you did everything correctly, your name will appear in the followers field. Now you will receive emails with notifications of any changes to this issue.

{% note info %}

You can also add other users to the list of followers. To do this, click on the word **Followers** and enter the login or name of the user.

{% endnote %}

## Subscribing to a queue {#section_k13_z5v_jz}

Subscribe to changes to a queue to track changes to all of the issues in the queue:

1. Open the [queue page](queue.md).

1. Select:
    - ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Subscribe to new issues** to get notifications about new issues created in the queue. You'll also be subscribed to notifications about all the events specified in the [notification settings](user-notifications.md#sec_add_role) for the **Queue subscriber** role.
    - ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Subscribe to all notifications** to get notifications of any changes to issues in the queue.

You can also [select events](user-subscriptions.md) to be notified about.

{% note tip %}

If the **Subscriptions** tab doesn't allow changing the list of events, go to the **Notifications** tab. You can [edit](user-notifications.md) the events in the section for the **Queue subscriber** role.

{% endnote %}

## Subscribing to a component {#section_km3_jnf_qz}

You can subscribe not only to a queue, but also to its individual components. This way you will only receive notifications about issues that are related to the components you are interested in.

To subscribe to a component:

1. Open the [queue page](queue.md).

1. Go to the **Components** tab.

1. Put the cursor over the component.

1. Select ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Subscribe**.

If you did everything right, you'll see the following icon next to the component name: ![](../../_assets/tracker/subscribtion.png)

By default, all notifications are sent to your email. You can [select events](user-subscriptions.md) to be notified about.

## Subscribing to a version {#section_n2y_jnf_qz}

To track issues associated with a specific version, subscribe to it:

1. Open the [queue page](queue.md).

1. Go to the **Versions** tab.

1. Put the cursor over the version.

1. Select ![](../../_assets/tracker/icon-settings.png) → **Subscribe**.

If you did everything right, you'll see the following icon next to the version number: ![](../../_assets/tracker/subscribtion.png)

By default, all notifications are sent to your email. You can [select events](user-subscriptions.md) to be notified about.



## Getting notifications about your own actions {#sec_self}

By default you don't get notifications for the actions you've done yourself. To enable notifications about your own actions:

1. {% include [open-personal-settings](../../_includes/tracker/open-personal-settings.md) %}

1. Enable **Receive updates with my own actions**.

1. Click **Save**.
