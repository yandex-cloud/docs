# Issue statistics

![](../../_assets/tracker/widgets/stat.png)

The widget displays issue distribution by values of a certain parameter.

{% note info %}

In the **Key parameter** field, we do not recommend using the **Summary** value because the widgets with such settings will soon be disabled. [Read more](../faq.md#section_del_widget).

{% endnote %}

To configure a widget, set the following:

- **Widget name**: Name to display in the widget header.

- **Issue source**: Filter on the basis of which the list of issues is formed. You can select a [system](default-filters.md) filter or a [previously created](create-filter.md) filter from the list or specify a filter using the [query language](query-filter.md) or parameters.

- **Number of rows on page**: Maximum number of chart rows to display in the widget. If there are more rows than the maximum, you can see them by clicking **Show All** at the bottom of the widget.

- **Key parameter**: Issue field to gather statistics for.

- **Sort by**: Sorting order for chart columns.
