## Extension specification {#spec}

Example specification:

```yaml
x-yc-apigateway-integration:
  type: dummy
  http_code: 302
  http_headers:
    Location: "/some/location"
    Set-Cookie: ["a={number}", "b=2"]
  content:
    "application/json": "{ \"message\": \"You've been redirected.\" }"
```

Extension specifics:
* If the request has the header `Accept:`
    * The best match is selected first.
    * If there is no match, the `*` key is selected.
    * If there is no key, the `415 Media not supported` response is returned.
* If the `Accept` header is missing, an arbitrary response is selected.
* If the content option is selected by the `*` key, the response's `Content-Type` is picked from `http_headers`. If it isn't specified there, the actual `Content-Type` is returned.
