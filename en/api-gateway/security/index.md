# Access management

Yandex.Cloud users can only perform operations on resources that are permitted under the roles assigned to them.
If a user doesn't have any roles assigned, almost all operations are forbidden.

To allow access to resources (API gateways) in {{ api-gw-name }}, assign the required roles to the user from the list below. For now, a role can only be assigned for a parent resource (folder or cloud).

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see [{#T}](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation.

{% endnote %}
