# Connecting a domain

You can connect your own domain to access the API gateway. You can connect multiple domains to a single API gateway. In this case, the domain is identified by the `Host` header.

{% note warning %}

This must be a third-level domain or higher (for example, www.example.com). This has to do with how CNAME records are processed on DNS hosting. Learn more in [RFC 1912, Section 2.4.](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1912.txt)

{% endnote %}

To connect a domain to an API gateway:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

	1. Host a CNAME record with your DNS provider or on your own DNS server:

	    ```
	    <domain> IN CNAME <API gateway service domain>
	    ```

		{% cut "How to find your API gateway service domain" %}
		
		1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
		1. Select the folder where the API gateway is located and in the list of services, **API Gateway**
		1. Select the API gateway.
		1. In the window that opens, go to **Overview**. You can see the service domain under **General information**.

		{% endcut %}

	1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the API gateway is located.

	1. In the list of services, select **Certificate Manager** and:

		1. [Create](../../certificate-manager/operations/managed/cert-create.md) a certificate from Let's Encrypt<sup>®</sup>.
		1. [Confirm](../../certificate-manager/operations/managed/cert-validate.md) the rights for the domain.
		1. When the certificate status changes to `Issued`, [create](../../certificate-manager/operations/domain/domain-create.md) a domain. In the **Certificate** field, select the certificate that you created in Step 3.1.

		{% note info %}

		The Let's Encrypt<sup>®</sup> certificate is valid for 90 days. You need to [update](../../certificate-manager/concepts/managed-certificate.md#renew) it on time. In some cases, domain rights checks are performed [automatically](../../certificate-manager/concepts/challenges.md#auto).

		{% endnote %}

	1. Go back to the folder page.

	1. In the list of services, select **API Gateway** and:

		1. Select the API gateway.
