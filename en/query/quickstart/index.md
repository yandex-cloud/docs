# Getting started with {{ yq-name }}: Overview

{{ yq-full-name }} provides [analytical processing](../concepts/batch-processing.md) of data stored in [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../../storage/index.yaml) and [streaming processing](../concepts/stream-processing.md) of real-time data from [{{ yds-full-name }}](../../data-streams/index.yaml). {{ yq-name }} is built around the concept of [unified streaming and analytical computations](../concepts/unified-processing.md). This allows you to use a single query to process both streaming and analytical data.

 {{ yq-name }} runs data queries in an SQL-like language called [YQL](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/yql/reference/syntax/).
