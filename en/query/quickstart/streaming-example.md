# Processing of data streams from {{ yds-full-name }}

In this example, you will [process a data stream](../concepts/stream-processing.md) on New York City taxi rides. Data for the example will be written by a generator to a dedicated [{{ yds-full-name }}](../../data-streams/index.yaml) stream.

As a result, you will get the total cost of the first ten rides since the stream data processing began.

To run this example:

1. [{#T}](#before-you-begin).
1. [{#T}](#create-datastream).
1. [{#T}](#configure-generation).
1. [{#T}](#run-query).
1. [{#T}](#check-result).

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

1. Sign in or sign up to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). If you do not yet have an account, go to the management console and follow the instructions.
1. On the [**Billing**]({{ link-console-billing }}) page, make sure you have a [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) linked and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you do not yet have a billing account, [create one](../../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. If you do not have any folder, [create one](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/create.md).
1. We will connect to our data stream using a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md). Thus, you will need to [create](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md#create-sa) a service account with the `datastream-connection-account` name and the `ydb.editor` role.
1. Data streams use {{ ydb-full-name }}. [Create](../../ydb/quickstart.md#serverless) a serverless database.

## Create a data stream {#create-datastream}

{% include [create-stream-tutorial](../../_includes/data-streams/create-stream-tutorial.md) %}

## Set up data generation {#configure-generation}

{% include [streaming-infra](../_includes/create-tutorial-streaming-infra.md) %}

Data generation to the `yellow-taxi` stream will start. Use the **Stop** and **Start** buttons to control the data generator.

## Run the query {#run-query}

1. In the query editor in the {{ yq-name }} interface, click **New streaming query**.
1. Enter the query text in the text field:

   ```sql
   $data =
   SELECT
       *
   FROM
       bindings.`tutorial-streaming` LIMIT 10;

   SELECT
       HOP_END() AS time,
       COUNT(*) AS ride_count,
       SUM(total_amount) AS total_amount
   FROM
       $data
   GROUP BY
       HOP(CAST(tpep_pickup_datetime AS Timestamp), "PT1M", "PT1M", "PT1M");
   ```

1. Click **Run**.

## Review the result {#check-result}

Once the query is completed, you'll see the following results: the total cost (`total_amount`) of the first 10 rides made after the query ran.

| # | time | ride_count | total_amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2022-11-28T16:05:00.000000Z | 10 | 5675.542679843059 |
