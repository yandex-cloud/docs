# Data pattern processing

A **data pattern** is a combination of events, as well as conditions and correlations between these events, used to track various regularities and detect events. Pattern searching is used for analyzing and monitoring event streams in real time, enabling prompt response to changes and making crucial decisions. In data analysis systems, a data pattern builds a rule by which the system determines whether the incoming event stream meets certain criteria; this results in triggering specific actions or notifications.

Here is a hands-on example of pattern processing in a data stream produced by an IoT device, where pressing its buttons triggers certain events. Let's assume you need to find and process the following sequence of button clicks: `button 1`, `button 2`, and `button 3`. The data is transmitted as JSON strings, which are distributed across the `ts` and `button` columns of `input_stream` using [data bindings](glossary.md#binding).

The structure of the data to transmit is as follows:
```json
{"ts":1700000000, "button": 1, "device_id": 1, "zone_id": 24}
{"ts":1701000000, "button": 2, "device_id": 2, "zone_id": 12}
```

The body of the SQL query to {{ yql-short-name }} looks like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM bindings.input_stream MATCH_RECOGNIZE ( -- Performing pattern matching from input_stream
    ORDER BY ts -- Viewing events based on the ts column data sorted ascending (data type: Timestamp)
    MEASURES
      LAST(B1.ts) AS b1, -- Going to get the latest timestamp of clicking button 1 in the query results
      LAST(B3.ts) AS b3  -- Going to get the latest timestamp of clicking button 3 in the query results

    ONE ROW PER MATCH    -- Going to get one result row per match hit
    AFTER MATCH SKIP TO NEXT ROW -- Going to move to the next row once the pattern match is hit
    PATTERN (
      B1 B2+ B3 -- Searching across the data for a pattern that includes one button 1 click, one or more button 2 clicks, and one button 3 click
    )
    DEFINE
        B1 AS B1.button = 1, -- Defining the B1 condition as clicking button 1 (the button field equals 1)
        B2 AS B2.button = 2, -- Defining the B2 condition as clicking button 2 (the button field equals 2)
        B3 AS B3.button = 3  -- Defining the B3 condition as clicking button 3 (the button field equals 3)
) AS MATCHED;
```


## Syntax {#syntax}

The `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` command searches for data based on a given pattern and returns the hits. Here is the SQL syntax of the `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` command:
```sql
MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
    [ PARTITION BY <pattern_1> [ ... , <pattern_N>] ]
    ORDER BY orderItem1 [ ... , orderItemN] [ASC]
    MEASURES LAST(<variable_1>)|FIRST(<variable_1>) [AS] <name_of_column_1> [ ... , LAST(<variable_N>)|FIRST(<variable_N>) [AS] <name_of_column_N>]
    ONE ROW PER MATCH
    [AFTER MATCH SKIP TO NEXT ROW]
    PATTERN (<search_pattern>)
    DEFINE <variable_1> AS <expression_1>[ ... , <variable_N> AS <expression_N>]
)
```

Here is a brief description of the SQL syntax elements of the `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` command:
* [`DEFINE`](#define): Conditions the rows must meet for each variable: `<variable_1> AS <expression_1>[ ... , <variable_N> AS <expression_N>]`.
* [`PATTERN`](#pattern): Pattern to search for across the data. It consists of variables and search rules of the pattern described in `<search_pattern>`. `PATTERN` works similarly to [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions).
* [`ONE ROW PER MATCH`](#rows_per_match): Determines the amount of output data for each hit match.
* [`AFTER MATCH SKIP TO NEXT ROW`](#after_match_skip_to_next_row): Defines the method of moving to the point of the next match search.
* [`MEASURES`](#measures): Specifies the list of output columns. Each column from the `<expression_1> [AS] <name_of_column_1> [ ... , <expression_N> [AS] <name_of_column_N>]` list is an independent construct that sets output columns and describes expressions for their computation.
* [`ORDER BY`](#order_by): Determines sorting of input data. Pattern search is performed within the data sorted according to the list of columns or expressions listed in `<expression_1> [AS] <name_of_column_1> [ ... , <expression_N> [AS] <name_of_column_N>]`.
* [`PARTITION BY`](#partition_by) divides the input data flow as per the specified rules in accordance with `<pattern_1> [ ... , <pattern_N>]`. Pattern search is performed independently in each part.


### DEFINE {#define}

```sql
DEFINE <variable_1> AS <expression_1>[, <variable_2> AS <expression_2>, ...]
```

`DEFINE` declares variables that are searched for in the input data. Variables are names of SQL expressions computed over the input data. SQL expressions in `DEFINE` have the same meaning as search expressions in a `WHERE` SQL clause. For example, the `button = 1` expression searches for all rows that contain the `button` column with the `1` value. Any SQL expressions that can be used to perform a search, including aggregation functions like `LAST` or `FIRST`, can act as conditions. For example, one can use such expressions as `button > 2 AND zone_id < 12` or `LAST(button) > 10`.

In your SQL statements, make sure to specify the variable name for which you are searching for matches. For instance, in the following SQL command, you need to specify the variable name for which the calculation is being performed (`A`), for the `button = 1` condition:

```sql
DEFINE
  A AS A.button = 1
```


{% include [info](../_includes/match_recognize_common_exclusion.md) %}


When processing each row of data, all logical expressions of all `DEFINE` keyword variables are calculated. If during the calculation of `DEFINE` variable expressions the logical expression gets the `TRUE` value, such a row is labeled with the `DEFINE` variable name and added to the list of rows subject to pattern matching.


#### **Examples** {#define-example}

When defining variables in SQL expressions, you can reference other variables:

```sql
DEFINE
  A AS A.button = 1,
  B AS B.button > 2 AND A.zone_id < 12
```

Here is an example of an SQL expression with references to other variables:
```sql
DEFINE
  A AS A.button = 1,
  B AS A.button > 2 AND A.device_id = 12 OR A.zone_id < 12
```


### PATTERN {#pattern}

```sql
PATTERN (<search_pattern>)
```

The `PATTERN` keyword describes the data search pattern in the format derived from variables in the `DEFINE` section. The `PATTERN` syntax is similar to the one of [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions).

{% note warning %}

If a variable used in the `PATTERN` section has not been previously described in the `DEFINE` section, it is assumed that it is always `TRUE`.

{% endnote %}

`PATTERN` also enables using [quantifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Quantification). In regular expressions, they determine the number of repetitions of an element or subsequence in the matched pattern. Letâ€™s use the `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` variables from the `DEFINE` section to explain how quantifiers work. Here is the list of supported quantifiers:

| Quantifier | Description |
|----|-----|
| `A+` | One or more occurrences of `A` |
| `A*` | Zero or more occurrences of `A` |
| `A?` | Zero or one occurrence of `A` |
| `B{n}` | Exactly `n` occurrences of `B` |
| `C{n, m}` | From `n` to `m` occurrences of `C` (`m` inclusive) |
| `D{n,}` | At least `n` occurrences of `D` |
| `(A\|B)` | Occurrence of `A` or `B` in the data |
| `(A\|B){,m}` | No more than `m` occurrences of `A` or `B` (`m` inclusive) |


Supported pattern search sequences:

| Supported sequences | Syntax | Description |
|---|---|----|
| Sequence | `A B+ C+ D+` | The system searches for the exact specified sequence, the occurrence of other variables within the sequence is not allowed. The pattern search is performed in the order of the pattern variables. |
| One of | `A \| B \| C` | Variables are listed in any order with a pipe (`\|`) between them. The search is performed for any variable from the specified list. |
| Grouping | `(A \| B)+ \| C` | Variables inside round brackets are considered a single group. In this case, quantifiers apply to the entire group. |


#### **Example** {#pattern-example}

```sql
PATTERN (
  B1 E* B2+ B3
)
DEFINE
    B1 as B1.button = 1,
    B2 as B2.button = 2,
    B3 as B3.button = 3
```

The `DEFINE` section describes the `B1`, `B2`, and `B3` variables, while it does not describe `E`. Such notation allows interpreting `E` as any event, so the following pattern will be searched: one `button 1` click, one or more `button 2` clicks, and one `button 3` click. Meanwhile, between a click of `button 1` and `button 2`, any number of any other events may occur.


### ROWS PER MATCH {#rows_per_match}

`ROWS PER MATCH` determines the number of pattern matches. `ONE ROW PER MATCH` sets the _one row per match_ mode. The data schema of the result will be a union of [partitioning columns](#partition_by) and all [dimension](#measures) columns.



### AFTER MATCH SKIP TO NEXT ROW {#after_match_skip_to_next_row}

`AFTER MATCH SKIP TO NEXT ROW` is an optional parameter. It determines the method of transitioning from the found match to searching the next match.

If a [pattern](#pattern) with a quantifier that implies variable repetition is specified first or last, the search results return a set of rows, each matching the occurrence of the variable.


#### Examples {#match-examples}

The input data for all examples are:
```text
 button: 1
 button: 1
 button: 2
 button: 2
 button: 3
 button: 3
 button: 3
```


##### **Example 1** {#match-example1}

If a quantifier allowing only one match is specified first and last in the expression, a single result row is returned.

```sql
MEASURES
  LAST(B1.button) AS b1,
  LAST(B2.button) AS b2,
  LAST(B3.button) AS b3
PATTERN (
  B1 B2+ B3
)
DEFINE
    B1 AS B1.button = 1,
    B2 AS B2.button = 2,
    B3 AS B3.button = 3,

```

Result:
|b1|b2|b3|
|--|--|--|
|1|2|3|


##### **Example 2** {#match-example2}

When a quantifier that allows multiple matches is applied to the first pattern variable, one row will be added to the result for each match of this element. As a result, the number of resulting rows will equal the number of matches of the first element in the pattern.

```sql
MEASURES
  LAST(B1.button) AS b1,
  LAST(B2.button) AS b2,
  LAST(B3.button) AS b3
PATTERN (
  B1+ B2+ B3
)
DEFINE
    B1 AS B1.button = 1,
    B2 AS B2.button = 2,
    B3 AS B3.button = 3
```

Result:
|b1|b2|b3|
|--|--|--|
|1|2|3|
|1|2|3|


##### **Example 3** {#match-example3}

When indicating the last quantifier that allows multiple matches, a set of rows will be returned in accordance with the number of found matches: one row for each match at the beginning and one row for each match at the end. The result will be a Cartesian product of input and output matches.

```sql
MEASURES
  LAST(B1.button) AS b1,
  LAST(B2.button) AS b2,
  LAST(B3.button) AS b3
PATTERN (
  B1 B2+ B3+
)
DEFINE
    B1 AS B1.button = 1,
    B2 AS B2.button = 2,
    B3 AS B3.button = 3
```

Result:
|b1|b2|b3|
|--|--|--|
|1|2|3|
|1|2|3|
|1|2|3|


##### **Example 4** {#match-example3}

When specifying the first and last quantifier, which allows multiple matches, a set of rows will be returned according to the number of found matches.

```sql
MEASURES
  LAST(B1.button) AS b1,
  LAST(B2.button) AS b2,
  LAST(B3.button) AS b3
PATTERN (
  B1+ B2+ B3+
)
DEFINE
    B1 AS B1.button = 1,
    B2 AS B2.button = 2,
    B3 AS B3.button = 3
```

Result:
|b1|b2|b3|
|--|--|--|
|1|2|3|
|1|2|3|
|1|2|3|
|1|2|3|
|1|2|3|
|1|2|3|


### MEASURES {#measures}

```sql
MEASURES LAST(<variable_1>)|FIRST(<variable_1>) [AS] <name_of_column_1> [ ... , LAST(<variable_N>)|FIRST(<variable_N>) [AS] <name_of_column_N>]
```

`MEASURES` describes the set of returned columns when a pattern is found. A set of returned columns should be represented by an SQL expression with the `LAST`/`FIRST` aggregate functions over the variables declared in the [`DEFINE`](#define) statement.


##### **Example** {#measures-example}

```sql
MEASURES
  LAST(B1.ts) AS b1,
  FIRST(B3.ts) AS b3
```


### ORDER BY {#order_by}

```sql
ORDER BY orderItem1 [ ... , orderItemN] [ASC]

orderItem ::= { <column_names> | <expression> }
```

`ORDER BY` determines sorting of the input data. That is, before all pattern search operations are performed, the data will be pre-sorted according to the specified keys or expressions. The syntax is similar to the `ORDER BY` SQL expression. Sorting is only allowed by fields of the [TimeStamp](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/yql/reference/types/primitive#datetime) type, with only ascending direction (`ASC`) supported.

##### **Example** {#order_by-example}

```sql
ORDER BY CAST(ts AS Timestamp),
         button_index DESC,
         ts2 ASC
```


### PARTITION BY {#partition_by}

```sql
PARTITION BY <pattern_1> [ ... , <pattern_N>]

partition ::= { <column_names> | <expression> }
```

`PARTITION BY` is an optional expression that partitions the input data according to the list of the fields specified in this keyword, converting the source data into multiple independent stream groups, each used for an independent pattern search. If the command is not specified, all data is processed as a single group.

The syntax is equivalent to the `PARTITION BY` SQL expression for window functions, covering all types of aggregation functions.

#### **Example** {#partition_by-example}

```sql
PARTITION BY building
```


## Limitations {#limitations}

Our support for the `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` command will eventually comply with [SQL-2016](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016); currently, however, the following limitations apply:
- [`ORDER_BY`](#order_by). As sorting columns, you can specify exactly one column (expression) with the [`Timestamp`](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/yql/reference/types/primitive#datetime) type. Only the ascending (`ASC`) sorting order is supported.
- [`MEASURES`](#measures). Neither aggregation functions nor `PREV`/`NEXT` are supported.
- [`ROWS PER MATCH`](#rows_per_match). Only the `ONE ROW PER MATCH` mode is supported; `ALL ROWS PER MATCH` is not.
- [`PATTERN`](#pattern). Union pattern variables are not implemented.
- [`DEFINE`](#define). Aggregation functions are not supported.
