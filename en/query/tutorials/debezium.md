# Processing CDC Debezium streams

[Debezium](https://debezium.io) is a change data capture service for streaming DB changes to other systems for processing. You can use {{ yds-full-name }} to capture these changes and {{ yq-full-name }} to process them. You can do the following with processed data:

* Send it to {{ monitoring-full-name }} to make charts and use it in alerting.
* Write it to a {{ yds-short-name }} stream and then send it to {{ sf-full-name }} for processing.
* Write it to a {{ yds-short-name }} stream and then transfer it to {{ data-transfer-full-name }} to be [sent to various storage systems](../../data-streams/tutorials/data-ingestion.md).

![debezium-architecture](../../_assets/query/debezium-architecture.png)

In this use case, you will send [{{ PG }}](https://www.postgresql.org/) database changes to a {{ yds-short-name }} stream using Debezium and then run a query to them with {{ yq-name }}. The query will return the number of changes in DB tables grouped by 10s interval. It is assumed that Debezium is installed on the server with {{ PG }} set up and running.

To implement this use case:

1. [{#T}](#create-yds-stream).
1. [{#T}](#credentials).
1. [{#T}](#debezium-server).
1. [{#T}](#connect-query).
1. [{#T}](#query).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

## Create a {{ yds-name }} data stream {#create-yds-stream}

[Create a stream](../../data-streams/operations/manage-streams.md#create-data-stream) named `debezium`.

## Set the stream connection parameters {#credentials}

1. [Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) a service account and [assign](../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md) it the `editor` role for your folder.
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md) a static access key.
1. On the server where {{ PG }} is set up and running, configure the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html):
   1. [Install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and run this command:

      ```bash
      aws configure
      ```

    1. Enter the following one by one:

      * `AWS Access Key ID [None]:`: [ID of the service account's access key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/access-key.md).
      * `AWS Secret Access Key [None]:`: [Secret access key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/access-key.md) of the service account.
      * `Default region name [None]:`: The `{{ region-id }}` availability zone.

## Set up Debezium Server {#debezium-server}

On the server where PostgreSQL is set up and running:

{% include [debezium-setup](../../_includes/data-streams/debezium-setup.md) %}

## Connect {{ yq-name }} to your data stream {#connect-query}

1. [Create a connection](../operations/connection.md#create) with the `yds-connection` name and `Data Streams` type.
1. On the binding creation page:
   * Enter the binding name: `debezium`.
   * Specify the stream: `cdebezium`.
   * Add a `JSON` column named `data`.
1. Click **Create**.

## Run a data query {#query}

Open the query editor in the {{ yq-name }} interface and run the query:

```sql
$debezium_data =
SELECT
    JSON_VALUE(data,"$.payload.source.table") AS table_name,
    DateTime::FromMilliseconds(cast(JSON_VALUE(data,"$.payload.source.ts_ms") AS Uint64)) AS `timestamp`
FROM bindings.`debezium`;

SELECT
    table_name,
    HOP_END()
FROM
    $debezium_data
GROUP BY
    HOP(`timestamp`, "PT10S", "PT10S", "PT10S"),
    table_name
LIMIT 2;
```

{% include [limit](../_includes/select-limit.md) %}
