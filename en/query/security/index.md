# Access management in {{ yq-name }}

{{ yq-name }} uses [roles](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) to manage access rights.

{{ yandex-cloud }} users can only perform operations on resources that are allowed by the roles assigned to them. If a user doesn't have any roles assigned, almost all operations are forbidden.

To allow access to resources in {{ yq-full-name }}, assign the required roles to the user from the list below. Currently, a role can only be assigned to a parent resource (folder or cloud). Roles are inherited by nested resources.

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see [{#T}](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation.

## Assigning roles {#grant-roles}

To assign a user a role:

{% include [grant-role-console](../../_includes/grant-role-console.md) %}

## What roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

You can manage access to {{ yq-name }} objects using both service and primitive roles. The chart below shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. For example, the `editor` role includes all `viewer` role permissions. You can find the description of each role under the chart.
