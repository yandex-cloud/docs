# Making a container private

For a container to be invoked only by users with the permission to do so, make the container private.

{% note info %}

If all unauthorized users (the `allUsers` system group) of a cloud or folder are granted the permission to invoke a container, the container will be public regardless of the settings. [How to revoke a role](../../iam/operations/roles/revoke.md).
