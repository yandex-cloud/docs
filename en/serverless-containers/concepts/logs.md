# Container logs

A container writes logs to {{ cloud-logging-full-name }}, to the [default log group](../../logging/concepts/log-group.md) for the folder where the container is located.

There are two types of logs:

* Automatic: Logs of requests to containers.
* Custom: Logs that custom code writes to the standard output (stdout) and standard error output (stderr).

Learn more about working with logs in the [{{ cloud-logging-full-name }} documentation](../../logging/).
