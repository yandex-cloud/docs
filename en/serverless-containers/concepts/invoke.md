# Invoking a container

You can invoke a container:

* Over [HTTPS](#https).
* Using a [{{ sf-full-name }} trigger](#trigger).
* Using the [{{ api-gw-full-name }} extension](#extension).

When invoking a container, your application accepts HTTP requests to the port passed in the `PORT` environment variable. The port on which the application serves HTTP requests is set in the container revision settings.

## HTTPS {#https}

When calling a container over HTTPS, an HTTP request is passed to the application deployed in the container.

### Filtering message headers {#filter}

When being passed to the container, some HTTP request and response headers change, as described below.

{% list tabs %}

- Request headers

    Removed from a request:
    
    - "Expect"
    - "Te"
    - "Trailer"
    - "Upgrade"
    - "Proxy-Authenticate"
    - "Authorization"
    - "Connection"
    - "Content-Md5"
    - "Max-Forwards"
    - "Server"
    - "Transfer-Encoding"
    - "Www-Authenticate"
    - "Cookie"

- Response headers

    - Removed from a response:
        - "Host"
        - "Authorization"
        - "User-Agent"
        - "Connection"
        - "Max-Forwards"
        - "Cookie"

    - Cause an error if present in a response:
        - "Proxy-Authenticate"
        - "Transfer-Encoding"
        - "Via"

    - Overwritten by adding the `X-Yf-Remapped-` prefix:
        - "Content-Md5"
        - "Date"
        - "Server"
        - "Www-Authenticate"

{% endlist %}

### IP address of the request source {#ip}

The IP address of the client that called the container is passed in the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

## {{ sf-full-name }} trigger {#trigger}

When calling a container using a {{ sf-full-name }} trigger, the JSON description of a trigger event is passed in the body of an HTTP request to the container. Read more about triggers in the [{{ sf-full-name }} documentation](../../functions/concepts/trigger/index.md).

## {{ api-gw-full-name }} extension {#extension}

When invoking a container using the {{ api-gw-name }}, the container receives an HTTP request addressed to the API gateway. In this case, the `Host` header specifies the host on which the user accessed the API gateway rather than the container's host. Learn more about the extension in the [{{ api-gw-full-name }} documentation](../../api-gateway/concepts/extensions/containers.md).
