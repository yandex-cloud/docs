# Invoking a container

You can invoke a container:
* Using [HTTPS](#https).
* Using a [{{ sf-full-name }} trigger](#trigger).
* Using a [{{ api-gw-full-name }} extension](#extension).

{% include [port-variable-note.md](../../_includes/serverless-containers/port-variable-note.md) %}

## HTTPS {#https}

When calling a container over HTTPS, an HTTP request is passed to the application deployed in the container.

### Filtering message headers {#filter}

When being passed to the container, some HTTP request and response headers change, as described below.

{% list tabs %}

- Request headers

   Removed from a request:

   - "Expect"
   - "Te"
   - "Trailer"
   - "Upgrade"
   - "Proxy-Authenticate"
   - "Authorization"
   - "Connection"
   - "Content-Md5"
   - "Max-Forwards"
   - "Server"
   - "Transfer-Encoding"
   - "Www-Authenticate"
   - "Cookie"

- Response headers

   - Removed from a response:
      - "Host"
      - "Authorization"
      - "User-Agent"
      - "Connection"
      - "Max-Forwards"
      - "Cookie"

   - Cause an error if present in a response:

      - "Proxy-Authenticate"
      - "Transfer-Encoding"
      - "Via"

   - Overwritten by adding the `X-Yf-Remapped-` prefix:
      - "Content-Md5"
      - "Date"
      - "Server"
      - "Www-Authenticate"

{% endlist %}

### IP address of the request source {#ip}

The IP address of the client that called the container is passed in the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

## {{ sf-full-name }} trigger {#trigger}

When calling a container using a {{ sf-full-name }} trigger, the JSON description of a trigger event is passed in the body of an HTTP request to the container. Learn more about [triggers](trigger/index.md).

## {{ api-gw-full-name }} extension {#extension}

When invoking a container using the {{ api-gw-name }}, the container receives an HTTP request addressed to the API gateway. In this case, the `Host` header specifies the host on which the user accessed the API gateway rather than the container's host. Learn more about the extension in the [{{ api-gw-full-name }} documentation](../../api-gateway/concepts/extensions/containers.md).
