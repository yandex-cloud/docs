# Pricing for {{ serverless-containers-name }}

## What goes into the cost of using {{ serverless-containers-name }} {#rules}

In {{ serverless-containers-name }}, you're billed for the number of container invocations, computing resources allocated for the application, downtime of [provisioned instances](concepts/container.md#provisioned-instances), and outgoing traffic.

When billing computing resources, the number of cores (vCPUs), the memory allocated for the application, and the time that the application runs are taken into account:
* The number of cores specified when creating a revision is measured in vCPUs and is a positive real number.
* The memory size specified when creating a revision is measured in GB.
* The total container time is measured in hours and is rounded up to a multiple of 100 ms.

{% note warning %}

You're charged for all the container invocations that trigger your code to run.
