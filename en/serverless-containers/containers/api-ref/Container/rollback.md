To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the

In some languages, built-in datetime utilities do not support nanosecond precision (9 digits). ||
|| createdBy | **string**

ID of the user or service account who initiated the operation. ||
|| modifiedAt | **string** (date-time)

|| metadata | **[RollbackContainerMetadata](#yandex.cloud.serverless.containers.v1.RollbackContainerMetadata)**
