## What goes into the cost of using {{ captcha-full-name }} {#rules}

You pay for [requests to the {{ captcha-name }} API](./quickstart.md#check-answer) made at `https://smartcaptcha.yandexcloud.net/validate`. You only pay for [correct requests](concepts/validation.md#service-response) to which the API returns the `ok` status. Correct requests satisfy the following conditions:

* {{ captcha-name }} has identified the request as one sent by a human, not a bot.
* Correct `secret` and `token` values were provided.
* A unique `token` was issued 10 minutes ago or later.

{% note info %}

Using {{ captcha-name }} in [restricted mode](concepts/restricted-mode) is free of charge.

Examples of {{ captcha-name }} cost calculation:

1. The user has passed the CAPTCHA test resulting in a correct `/validate` request from the server. A fee will be charged.

1. The user has sent an empty or incorrect `token` resulting in an incorrect `/validate` request. No fee will be charged.

1. A backend developer has made a mistake and sent an incorrect `secret` or `token` in a response `/validate` request. The API will return an error in the `message` field. No fee will be charged.

1. An intruder has passed the CAPTCHA test, got a `token`, and sent it 10 times during the first minute. The API will return the `ok` status only to the first request, and you will be charged for the first request only.

1. An intruder has passed the CAPTCHA test, got a `token`, and sent it 10 times after 10 minutes. The API will return the `failed` status to all requests. You will not be charged for any of these.
