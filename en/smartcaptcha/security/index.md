# Access management in {{ captcha-name }}

In this section, you will learn about:

* [Resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [What roles this service has](#roles-list).

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

To assign a role for a resource, a user should have the `smart-captcha.admin` role or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

## Resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

You can assign a role for an [organization](../../organization/), [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), or [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder). Roles assigned for an organization, cloud, or folder also apply to the CAPTCHAs in them.

## What roles do I need {#choosing-roles}

The table shows actions and minimum roles required to perform them. You can always assign a role offering more permissions than the one specified in the table. For example, you can assign `smart-captcha.editor` instead of `smart-captcha.viewer`.

Action | User role
----- | -----
Viewing CAPTCHA information | `smart-captcha.viewer`
Creating a CAPTCHA | `smart-captcha.editor`
Editing a CAPTCHA | `smart-captcha.editor`
Deleting a CAPTCHA | `smart-captcha.editor`
Managing roles of CAPTCHA users | `smart-captcha.admin`
