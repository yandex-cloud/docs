You can create an image from a disk, snapshot, other image or URI.
Method starts an asynchronous operation that can be cancelled while it is in progress.

#### Command Usage

Syntax:

`yc beta compute image create <FOLDER-ID>`

#### Flags

#|
||Flag | Description ||
|| `-r`, `--request-file` | `string`

Path to a request file. ||
|| `--example-json` | Generates a JSON template of the request.
The template can be customized and used as input for the command.
Usage example:

1. Generate template: yc beta compute instance create --example-json > request.json
2. Edit the template: vim request.json
3. Run with template: yc beta compute instance create -r request.json ||
|| `--example-yaml` | Generates a YAML template of the request.
The template can be customized and used as input for the command.
Usage example:

1. Generate template: yc beta compute instance create --example-yaml > request.yaml
2. Edit the template: vim request.yaml
3. Run with template: yc beta compute instance create -r request.yaml ||
|| `--description` | `string`

Description of the image. ||
|| `--family` | `string`

The name of the image family to which this image belongs. For more information, see documentation. To get an information about the most recent image from a family, use a [ImageService.GetLatestByFamily] request. ||
|| `--folder-id` | `string`

ID of the folder to create an image in. To get the folder ID, use a [yandex.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.FolderService.List] request. ||
|| `--hardware-generation` | `shorthand/json`

Specify the overrides to hardware_generation of a source disk, image or snapshot, or to the default values if the source does not define it.

Shorthand Syntax:

```hcl
{
  features = generation2-features={} | legacy-features={
    pci-topology = PCI_TOPOLOGY_V1|PCI_TOPOLOGY_V2
  }
}
```

JSON Syntax:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "generation2-features": {},
    "legacy-features": {
      "pci-topology": "PCI_TOPOLOGY_V1|PCI_TOPOLOGY_V2"
    }
  }
}
```

Fields:

```
features -> (oneof<generation2-features|legacy-features>)
  Oneof features field
  legacy-features -> (struct)
    pci-topology -> (struct)
  generation2-features -> (struct)
``` ||
|| `--labels` | `map<string><string>`

Resource labels as 'key:value' pairs. ||
|| `--min-disk-size` | `int`

Minimum size of the disk that will be created from this image. Specified in bytes. Should be more than the volume of source data. ||
|| `--name` | `string`

Name of the image. ||
|| `--os` | `shorthand/json`

Operating system that is contained in the image. If not specified and you used the 'image_id' or 'disk_id' field to set the source, then the value can be inherited from the source resource.

Shorthand Syntax:

```hcl
{
  nvidia = {
    driver = string
  },
  type = LINUX|WINDOWS
}
```

JSON Syntax:

```json
{
  "nvidia": {
    "driver": "string"
  },
  "type": "LINUX|WINDOWS"
}
```

Fields:

```
nvidia -> (struct)
  Gpu type. This field is used to correctly select a node with a host gpu that matches the gpu from here, in order to run the VM on it.
  driver -> (string)
    Gpu driver version.
type -> (struct)
  Operating system type. The default is 'LINUX'. This field is used to correctly emulate a vCPU and calculate the cost of using an instance.
``` ||
|| `--pooled` | When true, an image pool will be created for fast creation disks from the image. ||
|| `--product-ids` | `[]string`

License IDs that indicate which licenses are attached to this resource. License IDs are used to calculate additional charges for the use of the virtual machine. The correct license ID is generated by the platform. IDs are inherited by new resources created from this resource. If you know the license IDs, specify them when you create the image. For example, if you create a disk image using a third-party utility and load it into Object Storage, the license IDs will be lost. You can specify them in this request. ||
|| `--image-id` | `string`

ID of the source image to create the new image from. ||
|| `--disk-id` | `string`

ID of the disk to create the image from. ||
|| `--snapshot-id` | `string`

ID of the snapshot to create the image from. ||
|| `--uri` | `string`

URI of the source image to create the new image from. Currently only supports links to images that are stored in Object Storage. Must be a valid documentation. Currently only supports Qcow2, VMDK, and RAW image formats. ||
|| `--async` | Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting for the operation to complete. ||
