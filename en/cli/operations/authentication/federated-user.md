# Authenticating as a federated user

You can use a [federated account](../../../iam/concepts/index.md#saml-federation) to work with {{ yandex-cloud }} if your company has an [identity federation](../../../iam/concepts/federations.md) set up. In this case, a personal [Yandex account](../../../iam/concepts/index.md#passport) is not required.

If you don't have the {{ yandex-cloud }} command line interface, [install it](../install-cli.md).
