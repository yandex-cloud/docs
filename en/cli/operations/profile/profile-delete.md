{% note important %}

You can't delete a profile if:

- It is an active profile.

1. Get the list of profiles:

    ```
    $ yc config profile list
    prod ACTIVE
    test
    ```

1. Delete the `test` profile:

    ```
    $ yc config profile delete test
    Profile 'test' deleted
    ```

1. Make sure that the profile was deleted:

    ```
    $ yc config profile list
    prod ACTIVE
    ```
