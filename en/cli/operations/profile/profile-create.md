# Creating a profile

There are two ways to create a profile:
- [Creating an empty profile and adding parameters manually](#create).

   This creates and activates an empty profile: you have to [add all the parameters separately](manage-properties.md).
- [Wizard-based profile creation with basic parameters](#interactive-create).

   The CLI suggests setting the basic profile parameters step-by-step. You can use this method to redefine the parameters of an existing profile. This method doesn't work for service accounts.

## Creating an empty profile and adding parameters manually {#create}

Create a profile with the `test` name:
1. Run this command:

   ```bash
   yc config profile create test
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   Profile 'test' created and activated
   ```


1. Add the necessary profile parameters, such as a folder:

   ```bash
   yc config set folder-id <folder ID>
   ```

   View the full [list of profile parameters](../../concepts/core-properties.md) and learn how to [manage](manage-properties.md) them.

You can view an example of this type of profile when [getting started](../../quickstart.md).

## Wizard-based profile creation with basic parameters {#interactive-create}



If you use the wizard to create a profile, the CLI prompts you to enter the basic profile parameters step-by-step:
* Profile name.
* OAuth token (for a Yandex account).
* The cloud you have access rights to.
* Default folder.
* Default availability zone where {{ compute-full-name }} resources are created.

You can stop profile creation at any time. All the settings you entered before stopping are saved to the profile.


If you aren't connected to the management console yet, log in to the [console]({{ link-console-main }}) and accept the user agreement by clicking **Log in**.
