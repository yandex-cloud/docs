Also updates were made to the forms for [creating connections](../operations/create-connection.md).

1. [{{ websql-name }}](/services/websql) is the first service integrated with [{{ metadata-hub-full-name }}](../../metadata-hub/index.yaml). All [connections](../concepts/index.md#connection) are stored in [{{ connection-manager-name }}](../../metadata-hub/concepts/connection-manager.md), but you can also manage ([create](../operations/create-connection.md), [delete](../operations/delete-connection.md), and [edit](../operations/change-connection-settings.md)) them from the {{ websql-name }} interface. All changes you make in {{ websql-name }} are displayed in {{ connection-manager-name }} and vice versa.

Once published, the query will be available to all folder users. This action cannot be undone â€” you can only delete the query you published. [Roles](../security/index.md#roles-list) allow you to manage user access to a published query: you can grant permissions for viewing and editing a query or managing its access permissions.

1. The {{ websql-name }} interface now allows you to share links to various entities. For example, you can send a link to a connection, saved query you published, or page with access permissions for a published query to your colleague.
