# Public network {#public-network}

A _public network_ is an internet-facing network providing physical connectivity for all servers. On [some](./network-restrictions.md#blocked-ports) TCP and UDP ports, network traffic between the private network and the internet is limited. Some {{ baremetal-name }} server [configurations](./server-configurations.md) support reserving [MC-LAG](./mc-lag.md) public network channels.

When working with a public network and internet access, make sure to comply with the [terms of use](https://yandex.com/legal/cloud_termsofuse/en/).

## Ephemeral public subnet {#ephemeral-public-subnet}

An _ephemeral public subnet_ is a public subnet of the `/31` size that is randomly assigned to a {{ baremetal-name }} server from the range of public IPv4 addresses reserved for {{ baremetal-full-name }}.

Ephemeral public subnets are assigned to servers with **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.field_needed-public-ip }}** set to `{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.label_public-ip-ephemeral }}` in their network parameters.

When leasing a {{ baremetal-name }} server, you can enable the [DHCP server](./dhcp.md#dhcp-ephemeral-public-subnet) in an ephemeral public subnet. To do this, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.label_public-ip-via-dhcp }}**. Otherwise, the DHCP server in this subnet will be disabled. You will not be able to change the DHCP server settings in such subnet later.

{% include [public-subnet-cidr-details](../../_includes/baremetal/public-subnet-cidr-details.md) %}

You can [convert](../operations/reserve-public-subnet.md#transform-ephemeral-to-dedicated) an ephemeral public subnet to a [dedicated public subnet](#public-subnet) of size `/31`; this dedicated public subnet of size `/31` will be resolving the default gateway's IP address and the server's public address in the same way as the ephemeral subnet.

The lifecycle of an ephemeral public subnet depends on the lifecycle of the server this subnet is assigned to. When a server lease is cancelled, the ephemeral public subnet assigned to it will be automatically deleted and the server’s public IPv4 address will be released back to the {{ baremetal-name }} address pool.

If the ephemeral public subnet has not been assigned to any server within one month of its creation, such a subnet will also be automatically deleted and its public IPv4 address will return to {{ baremetal-name }}'s address pool.

## Dedicated public subnet {#public-subnet}

A _dedicated public subnet_ is a public subnet made up of an IP address range that will be available to your servers in the selected [pools](./servers.md#server-pools). The IP address range is assigned to the dedicated public subnet automatically.

You can [order](../operations/reserve-public-subnet.md) a dedicated public subnet in the following sizes:

| Subnet size | Total number of IP addresses | Available IP addresses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/31`^1^ | 2 | 1 |
| `/29` | 8 | 5 |
| `/28` | 16 | 13 |
| `/27`^2^ | 32 | 29 |
| `/26`^2^ | 64 | 61 |
| `/25`^2^ | 128 | 125 |
| `/24`^2^ | 256 | 253 |

^1^ You can order a public subnet of size `/31` only by [converting](../operations/reserve-public-subnet.md#transform-ephemeral-to-dedicated) an [ephemeral public subnet](#ephemeral-public-subnet).
^2^ To order public subnets with sizes `/27`, `/26`, `/25`, and `/24`, [contact]({{ link-console-support }}/tickets/create) support.

When you cancel the lease of a server which has a dedicated public subnet assigned to it, its public IPv4 address is released back to the dedicated public subnet’s address pool so you can later use it for another server.

In {{ baremetal-full-name }}, dedicated public subnets are [billable](../pricing.md). The minimum lease period for a dedicated public subnet is one month, so you cannot delete such a subnet during the first month after the order date.

{% note info %}

The default gateway in a dedicated public subnet remains inactive (does not respond to `ping` requests) until at least one server is connected to that public subnet.

## IP address distribution in public subnets {#address-distribution}

{% include [public-subnet-no-dhcp](../../_includes/baremetal/public-subnet-no-dhcp.md) %}

{% include [public-subnet-address-info](../../_includes/baremetal/public-subnet-address-info.md) %}

Within a dedicated public subnet range, IP addresses are distributed as follows:

{% list tabs %}

- Subnets of size `/31`

  * First IP address in the range is the default gateway address.
  * Second IP address in the range is the address available for assignment to the network interface.

  {% include [public-subnet-cidr-31-example](../../_includes/baremetal/public-subnet-cidr-31-example.md) %}

- Subnets of size `/29` or more

  * First IP address in the range is the subnet address.
  * Second IP address in the range is the default gateway address.
  * Third to second-last addresses in the range are addresses available for assignment to network interfaces.
  * Last IP address in the range is the [broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address) (`broadcast`) address.

  For example:

  * Subnet CIDR: `198.51.100.104/29`.
  * Network IP address: `198.51.100.104`.
  * Default gateway IP address: `198.51.100.105`.
  * Available addresses: From `198.51.100.106` to `198.51.100.110`.
  * Broadcast address: `198.51.100.111`.
