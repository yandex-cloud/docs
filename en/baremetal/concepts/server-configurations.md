# Stock server configurations

You can order a server in one of the stock configurations, e.g., based on the processor, memory, and number of disks you need. Alternatively, you can choose a server specifically tailored for a particular task, such as servers with a powerful processor for high-performance computing or servers for data storage with many large disks.

You can view the configurations available for lease in each pool when ordering a server in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

For more information on how to lease a stock configuration server, see [{#T}](../operations/servers/server-lease.md).

If there are no suitable stock configurations, you can design a [custom one](../operations/servers/custom-server-lease.md) from available parts or [contact us](https://yandex.cloud/en/services/baremetal#contact-form) for a [on-request configuration](server-individual-configurations.md).

If there is free capacity available in the pools of your choice, you can lease servers of the following configurations:
