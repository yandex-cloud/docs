# Managing {{ baremetal-name }} servers

To order servers and manage your server lease periods, use the management console: from there, you can select a stock configuration or build a custom one from available parts. 

As soon as your server is ordered and ready to go, you can manage it via:

* [KVM console](../operations/servers/server-kvm.md)
* [CLI](../cli-ref)
* [API](../api-ref)

You can get audit logs of your operations using [{{ at-name }}](../at-ref.md), and manage roles and accesses via [{{ iam-name }}](../security/index.md).
