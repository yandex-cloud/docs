## How to enable services {#enable}

You can use the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) to enable services and manage resources. It allows you to launch VM instances in {{ yandex-cloud }}, connect to them, access object storage, create databases, and more.


Services at the Preview stage are available only to some users. If you want to use one of these services, send us a request for access. You can do this on the page of the service you want to use.
