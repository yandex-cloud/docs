# Availability zones

{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %}

At its initial stage, the {{ yandex-cloud }} platform is hosted in three Yandex data centers located in different areas of Russia (the Vladimir, Ryazan, and Moscow regions). The {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure in each data center is called an _availability zone_. Each zone is isolated from hardware and software failures that may occur in other availability zones. By deploying your apps in multiple zones, you ensure fault tolerance and significantly reduce the risk of data loss.

You can host resources in the following availability zones:
* `{{ region-id }}-a`;
* `{{ region-id }}-b`;
* `{{ region-id }}-c` (with limitations â€” see the [details](ru-central1-c-deprecation.md)).

{% note info %}

When new availability zones appear or existing ones change location, {{ yandex-cloud }} notifies all its customers.

{% endnote %}

{{ yandex-cloud }} resources are either _zonal_ (linked to an availability zone) or _global_ (not linked to zones).

Zonal resources include [virtual machines](../../compute/concepts/vm.md) and [disks](../../compute/concepts/disk.md). Global resources include [cloud networks](../../vpc/concepts/network.md) and [buckets](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md).

{% endif %}

{% if product == "cloud-il" %}

An _availability zone_ is an infrastructure within a data center that hosts {{ yandex-cloud }}. {{ yandex-cloud }} resources are either _zonal_ (linked to an availability zone) or _global_ (not linked to any zone). Zonal resources include [virtual machines](../../compute/concepts/vm.md) and [disks](../../compute/concepts/disk.md). Global resources include [cloud networks](../../vpc/concepts/network.md) and [buckets](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md).

At the first stage, {{ yandex-cloud }} is hosted in a data center located in Tirat Carmel, Israel. Therefore, you can only deploy your applications in a single availability zone: `il1-a`. Later, as new availability zones appear, you'll be able to enhance the fault tolerance of your applications deploying them in multiple standalone zones. A hardware or software failure in an availability zone will not affect other availability zones, which significantly reduces the risk of data loss.
