## How to run Bash commands in the Windows terminal {#soft-bash}

{% list tabs %}

- WLS

   [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) is available for Windows 10 or higher.

   1. To check whether WSL is installed on your PC, run the following command in cmd or PowerShell:

      ```powershell
      wsl -u root
      ```

      If WSL is installed, the terminal will switch to Bash mode:

      ```powershell
      root@<machine_name>:/mnt/c/Users/<username>#
      ```

   1. If not, [install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) WSL and repeat the previous step.

- Bash emulators

   If you are using Windows without WSL, you can install a Bash emulator, such as [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).

## How to adapt your code to command line shells native for Windows {#adapt-commands}

If you want to run your Bash code in cmd or PowerShell, bring it to the appropriate format:

1. [Replace basic syntax elements](#basic-syntax).
1. [Check the format of equivalent commands](#basic-syntax).
1. [Replace other commands with their equivalents](#replace-analogs).
1. [Check the names of system variables and auxiliary syntax](#replace-analogs).

### Replace basic syntax elements {#basic-syntax}

1. Replace the directory separator in file paths: `/` in Linux and `\` in Windows.
1. Replace line break characters. Instead of `\`, use `^` in cmd and `` ` `` in PowerShell.
1. Check out the rules for using all kinds of quotation marks, as they are handled differently in [Linux](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes) and [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_quoting_rules?view=powershell-7).
1. Check out the syntax for using variables.

   {% cut "Examples of using variables" %}

   | Action | Linux | Windows cmd | PowerShell |
   |-------|-------|-------|--------|
   | Writing a variable | `export VAR="1"` | `set VAR="1"` | `$Env:VAR="1"` |
   | Reading a variable | `${VAR}` | `%VAR%` | `$Env:VAR` |

   {% endcut %}

### Check the format of equivalent commands {#check-format}

Many commands in cmd and PowerShell have aliases similar to Bash commands. For example, the `Set-Location` PowerShell command (change to a different directory) will be run if you type `cd`in the terminal.
If the code execution fails:

1. Check if the Bash command has an equivalent in your terminal. For example, in PowerShell, run:

   ```powershell
   alias
   ```

   This will output a list of all aliases defined in the system settings:

   ```text
   CommandType     Name                            Version    Source
   -----------     ----                            -------    ------
   Alias           % -> ForEach-Object
   Alias           ? -> Where-Object
   Alias           ac -> Add-Content
   Alias           asnp -> Add-PSSnapin
   Alias           cat -> Get-Content
   Alias           cd -> Set-Location
   Alias           CFS -> ConvertFrom-String       3.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
   Alias           chdir -> Set-Location
   Alias           clc -> Clear-Content
   Alias           clear -> Clear-Host

   ...

   ```

   For a complete list of aliases, see the `alias` command output.

1. Make sure the command in your command shell performs the same function as its equivalent Bash command.
1. Check the command format: the alias keys may differ. For example, the `ls` command has an alias in PowerShell, but the argument keys differ.

### Replace other commands with their equivalents {#replace-analogs}

1. If a command has no alias, find its equivalent.

   {% cut "List of equivalent commands in Linux, cmd, and PowerShell" %}

   | Action | Linux | Windows cmd | Windows PowerShell |
   |-------|------|------|-------|
   | List files in a directory | `ls -s` | `dir` | `dir`, `ls`, `Get-ChildItem` |
   | List files in a directory and sub-directories | `ls -R` | `tree` | `ls`, `Get-ChildItem` |
   | Create a file | `touch` | `copy nul > ` | `New-Item` |
   | Rename a file | `mv` | `ren` | `ren`, `Rename-Item` |
   | Copy a file | `cp` | `copy` | `copy`, `Copy-Item` |
   | Move a file | `mv` | `move` | `move`, `Move-Item` |
   | Delete a file | `rm` | `del` | `del`, `Remove-Item` |
   | Compare file content | `diff` | `fc` | `diff`, `Get-Content`, `Compare-Object` |
   | Find file strings or object properties | `grep` | `find` | `Select-String`, `Where-Object` |
   | Output command help | `man <command>` | `<command> /?` | `Get-Help <command>` |
   | Output the name of the current directory | `pwd` | `cd` | `$PWD` |
   | Create directory | `mkdir` | `md` | `mkdir`, `New-Item` |
   | Output current date and time | `date` | `time` | `Get-Date` |
   | Configure file access policies | `chown`, `chmod` | `attrib` | `attrib`, `Set-XFileOwner` |
   | Schedule the command run | `cron` | `at` | `schtasks`, `Register-ScheduledJob` |
   | Access a web resource over HTTP | `wget` | `wget` | `Invoke-WebRequest` |

   {% endcut %}

1. If a command has no direct equivalent, you can perform the same action using a combination of commands or other methods. For example, to convert a file to [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) in PowerShell, use the static Convert method: `[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes(''<filename>''))`.

1. Consider the specifics of your command shell. For example, PowerShell works with objects and their properties rather than text. Therefore, instead of searching by `grep`, you will need to use the `Where-Object` PowerShell command in most cases. It handles objects with required property values. To search for a sequence of characters, use the `Select-String` command.

### Check the names of system variables and auxiliary syntax {#replace-analogs}

1. Check the names of environment variables. For example, instead of the `USER` environment variable used in Linux, the `USERNAME` variable is used in Windows.
1. If your code contains comparison, selection, or loop statements, change the syntax to meet the requirements of your command shell.
