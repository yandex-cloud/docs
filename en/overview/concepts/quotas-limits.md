# Quotas and limits

Yandex.Cloud services can be subject to quotas and limits:

{% include [quotes-limits-def.md](../../_includes/quotes-limits-def.md) %}

When designing your infrastructure in Yandex.Cloud, consider the limits as the boundary of opportunities that Yandex Cloud can provide to you. Quotas are changeable restrictions that can potentially be increased to the values of limits.

## Why quotas are needed {#quotas}

Quotas serve as a soft restriction for requesting resources, and allow Yandex Cloud to guarantee the stability of the service: new users cannot take up too much resources for testing purposes. If you are ready to use more resources, contact the [technical support](https://console.cloud.yandex.com/support) and tell us exactly which quotas you need to increase, and how.

Technical support decides whether or not to increase quotas on an individual basis.

## Quotas and limits defaults for Yandex.Cloud services

Quotas are listed with default values that match the quotas of the [trial period](../../free-trial/).
