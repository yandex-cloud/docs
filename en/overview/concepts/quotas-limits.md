# Quotas and limits

{{ yandex-cloud }} services can be subject to quotas and limits:

{% include [quotes-limits-def.md](../../_includes/quotes-limits-def.md) %}

When designing your infrastructure in {{ yandex-cloud }}, plan for the limits as the maximum that {{ yandex-cloud }} can provide you with. Quotas are restrictions that can potentially be increased up to their limit.

## Why quotas are needed {#quotas}

Quotas serve as a soft restriction for requesting resources and let {{ yandex-cloud }} guarantee service stability because new users can't take up too many resources for testing purposes. If you're willing to use more resources, you can increase them in the following ways:

* [Submit an increase request]({{ link-console-quotas }});
* Contact the [technical support]({{ link-console-support }}) and tell us which consumed quotas you need to increase and by how much.

## Default quotas and limits for services {{ yandex-cloud }}

Quotas are listed with default values that match the quotas of the [trial period](../../free-trial/).
