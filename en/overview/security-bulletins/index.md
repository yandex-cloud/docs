### Impact on Yandex.Cloud services

The OS images available to {{ compute-full-name }} are already contain all the necessary patches. However, the new VMs created in {{ compute-full-name }} are not vulnerable to those vulnerabilities.

### Mitigation Techniques

In addition to the patches you can implement and enforce network access control so that your DC is not accessible from untrusted networks. This can be achieved by:
* setting up Windows Firewall or Security Groups;
* putting your DC under a NAT-gateway.
