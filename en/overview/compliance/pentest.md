# Penetration tests

Yandex.Cloud customers that use the [paid version of the service](../../billing/operations/activate-commercial.md) can run penetration tests against their Yandex.Cloud infrastructure.

To run the tests:

1. Make sure that the [billing accounts]({{ link-console-billing }}) of the resources tested have `ACTIVE` status.

1. Coordinate the testing with us: send a request to [technical support]({{ link-console-support }}) or your Yandex.Cloud manager. The managers will check the details and tell you when you can start testing.

1. Start testing according to the agreed plan.

   {% note alert %}

   Keep in mind that your tests should not affect the health and availability of resources of other Yandex.Cloud users.

   {% endnote %}
