# Rules for performing external security scans

Yandex.Cloud users can perform external security scans, including penetration tests, for the software they host in the cloud. They can carry out these scans themselves or have a contractor do it for them.

Scan rules are described in detail in the Acceptable Use Policy: [Rules for performing of External Security Scans](https://yandex.com/legal/cloud_pentest/).
To perform a scan, you need an active [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md).

You can ask additional questions about performing scans when negotiating your request. To apply for a scan:
1. Request an **External security scan form** from Yandex.Cloud [technical support]({{ link-console-support }}) using the cloud owner account.
1. Fill out the form and submit it to technical support.
1. Wait for confirmation from the technical support team that your request was approved by the information security department.
