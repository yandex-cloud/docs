# Pricing policy

## Service plans {#plans}

* _PAYG (Pay As You Go)_: You are only charged for actual usage. {{ price-per-hour-count-per-second }}
* _BYOL (Bring Your Own License)_: Pricing that is available for some products and lets you run software on the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure using licenses purchased from third-party providers (sellers). You are only charged for using {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, therefore, you can buy your own licenses and manage them. For more information about license mobility in {{ yandex-cloud }}, see [Microsoft licenses](licensing.md#mobility).

## Computing resources {#compute}

The total cost depends on the resources used. Learn more about {{ compute-name }} pricing at [{#T}](../compute/pricing.md).

## Minimum configuration {#config}

The minimum configuration required for running the selected product is set automatically. You can calculate the cost of the desired configuration using the [calculator]({{ link-cloud-calculator }}).
