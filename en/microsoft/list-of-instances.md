* [Windows Server 2012 R2](/marketplace/products/yc/windows-server-2012r2-datacenter)

### Remote Desktop Services (RDS) {#rds}

The {{ marketplace-name }} provides [Windows RDS](/marketplace?tab=software&search=windows+rds) images based on [Windows Server 2019 Datacenter](/marketplace?tab=software&search=Windows+Server+2019+Datacenter) with the pre-activated Remote Desktop Licensing Server role and a custom license package. You can choose from RDS license packages of [5](/marketplace/products/yc/windows-rds-5-licenses), [10](/marketplace/products/yc/windows-rds-10-licenses), [25](/marketplace/products/yc/windows-rds-25-licenses), [50](/marketplace/products/yc/windows-rds-50-licenses), [100](/marketplace/products/yc/windows-rds-100-licenses), [250](/marketplace/products/yc/windows-rds-250-licenses), or [500](/marketplace/products/yc/windows-rds-500-licenses) licenses.

{% note warning %}

Images with pre-activated RDS are not optimized using the `sysprep` utility and have a constant SID. Otherwise, there might be conflicts if two VMs with the same number of licenses are running in the same domain. Optimization using the `sysrep` utility will also permanently reset the Remote Desktop Services license server activation.

### Changes to Windows VM images {#changes}

To work in the cloud, changes have been made to the operating system to anonymize it and delete temporary files.

#### Configuration of network services {#configuration}

* Windows remote management is enabled using the WinRM service. Rules that allow WinRM to run via HTTPS were created.
* Rules that allow using ICMP were created.
* The names of the network interfaces correspond to the names on the {{ yandex-cloud }} platform.
* RDP is enabled in the system registry, and the required rules and corresponding network ports have been configured.

#### Power saving settings {#power-saving-settings}

* The system's power plan is set to <q>High performance</q>.

#### Time settings {#time-settings}

* The `RealTimeIsUniversal` parameter is set, meaning that the hardware time is [UTC+0]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Всемирное_координированное_время){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time){% endif %}.

#### Other conversions {#conversions}

* The `ShutDownWithoutLogon` registry parameter allows responding to ACPI Call without having an interactive session.
* SMBv1 is disabled.
* The [serial console]({{ ms.docs }}/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/boot-parameters-to-enable-ems-redirection) is enabled.
* The system is optimized using the [Ngen]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngen){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Image_Generator){% endif %} utility.
* The `cloudbase-init` utility is installed to automate operations when initializing VMs.

### Drivers {#drivers}

To run VMs on Microsoft Windows, you need `virtIO` drivers for network and disk devices. The drivers are provided by the Fedora Project. VM images use the latest available stable version of the drivers that can be [downloaded](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/archive-virtio/virtio-win-0.1.185-2/) from the software developer's website.
