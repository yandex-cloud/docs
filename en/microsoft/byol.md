# Use of personal licenses for Microsoft products

{{ yandex-cloud }} allows you to use your own Microsoft product licenses on [dedicated hosts](../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md). In this case, the license relationships regulate only you as a client and Microsoft as a license vendor. You are fully responsible for complying with the Microsoft license [terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products).

When using Microsoft license products in {{ yandex-cloud }}, the cost of license is deducted from the cost of VM usage. You need to settle all license-related matters with your supplier.

## What licenses can I use {#which-licenses}

The possibility of using a license in {{ yandex-cloud }} depends on the license terms and conditions of a given Microsoft product. BYOL (Bring Your Own License) is possible if the license was purchased under one of the following agreements:

* Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA) or Microsoft Enterprise Subscription Agreement.
* Microsoft Server and Cloud Enrollment (SCE) Agreement.
* Microsoft Enterprise Subscription Agreement (EAS).
* Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA).
* Microsoft Open, Open Value, and Open Value Subscription.
* Microsoft Enrollment for Education Solutions (EES).

{% note info %}

Licenses purchased under Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) don't fit for BYOL.

{% endnote %}

Note that the list of licenses may change and not be exhaustive. Make sure to contact Microsoft for the up-to-date list of license programs suitable for BYOL in cloud environments.

## How do I transfer licenses {#how-to-bring-licenses}

1. [Import the necessary image](#how-to-import).
1. [Create a group of dedicated hosts](#create-host-group).
1. [Create a virtual machine on the dedicated host from the imported image](#create-vm).
1. [Make sure the VM is up and running and activate your license](#test-vm).

### Import the necessary image {#how-to-import}

You can import the image using the [{{ compute-name }} REST API](../compute/api-ref/Image/create).

1. Execute a query like:

   {% list tabs %}

   - Bash

      ```bash
      curl -H "Authorization: Bearer `yc iam create-token`" -H "accept: application/json" -X POST https://compute.{{ api-host }}/compute/v1/images -d '{"folderId": "<ID of your folder>", "name": "<image name>", "description": "<image description>", "os": {"type": "WINDOWS"}, "pooled": false, "uri": "<link to image in Object Storage>"}'
      ```

   - PowerShell

      ```powershell
      function Create-YCImage {
        param(
          [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
          [string]$folderId = "",

          [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
          [string]$name = "",

          [string]$description = "",

          [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
          [string]$os_type = "WINDOWS",

          [int64]$minDiskSizeGb = 50GB,

          [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
          [string]$uri = ""
        )

        $body = @"
      {
        "folderId": "$folderId",
        "name": "$name",
        "description": "$description",
        "os.type": "$os_type",
        "minDiskSize": "$minDiskSizeGb",
        "os": {
          "type": "$os_type"
        },
        "uri": "$uri"
      }
      "@

        Invoke-WebRequest `
          -Method POST `
          -URI https://compute.{{ api-host }}/compute/v1/images `
          -header @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $(& yc iam create-token)" } `
          -ContentType 'Application/json' `
          -body $body
      }


      $folderId = "<ID of your folder>"

      Create-YCImage `
        -folderId $folderId `
        -name "<image name>" `
        -uri "<link to image in Object Storage>"

      ```

   {% endlist %}

1. Open the [management console]({{ link-console-cloud }}), and choose the folder whose ID you specified in the `folderId` parameter in the first step.
1. Go to {{ compute-name }} and choose the **Images** tab.
1. Find the image to be imported, it's in `Creating` status. Wait for the status to change from `Creating` to `Ready`.

### Create a group of dedicated hosts {#create-host-group}

You can use your own licenses only on VMs created on dedicated hosts. Contact your account manager for a quota for a dedicated host group. Note that the minimum number of vCPU cores on dedicated hosts is 128, and they are all paid.

Create a group of dedicated hosts [according to the instructions](../compute/operations/dedicated-host/create-host-group.md).

### Create a VM from your image on the dedicated host {#create-vm}

On the dedicated host, create a VM with the boot disk from the imported image. Specify the ID of the dedicated host in the `--host-id` parameter. You can create a VM only using the CLI, API, or Terraform. Run the command:

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   ```bash
   yc compute instance create \
   --host-id <ID of dedicated host> \
   --name 'win-test' \
   --folder-id <folder ID> \
   --cores <number of vCPUs> \
   --core-fraction 100 \
   --memory <amount of RAM, GB> \
   --network-interface subnet-id=<subnet ID>,nat-ip-version=ipv4 \
   --create-boot-disk image-id=<ID of imported image> \
   --zone <availability zone> \
   ```

{% endlist %}

## Reset the administrator password {#reset-password}

{% note warning %}

If you don't have a password reset agent, [install](../compute/operations/vm-guest-agent/install.md) it.

{% endnote %}

To access the VM, reset the default administrator password and generate a new one.

1. Open the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
1. Select **{{ compute-name }}**.
1. Find the `win-test` VM in the list and wait until its status changes to `RUNNING`. Select the VM.
1. Click **Reset password**.
1. In the window that opens, click **Generate password**.

{% note warning %}

Be sure to save the generated password. It won't be displayed in the management console once you close the window.

{% endnote %}

## Test the VM {#test-vm}

Connect to the created VM [using RDP](../compute/operations/vm-connect/rdp.md) with the password generated after you reset the default one.

After that, you can activate your license.
