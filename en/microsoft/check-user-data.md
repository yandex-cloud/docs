To check and update user details, follow these steps:

1. In the management console, go to [**Billing**]({{ link-console-billing }}?section=accounts).

1. Select a billing account in whose cloud you use a Microsoft product and go to the **Overview** page.

1. Make sure that the **Payer information** section contains up-to-date user details. If the details are outdated or incomplete, click **Edit data in Yandex Balance**. A page for editing payer details opens.

1. Update the details. For more information, see [Help for Yandex Balance](https://yandex.ru/support/balance/operations/change-data.html).

When deploying the product in the future, you will not need to provide the details again.
