# Integration with version and data control systems

{{ ml-platform-short-name }} is integrated with the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system and [DVC](https://dvc.org/) data version control system.

## Integration with the DVC data version control system {#dvc}

To work with the DVC system, use the following commands:

* **%dvc_init**: Initialize a DVC project in the current directory.

    {% cut "Description of command parameters." %}
    * `-f`, `--force`: Deletes an existing internal DVC directory. This clears the entire local cache.
    * `--subdir`: Initializes a DVC project in the working directory even if it isn't the root of the Git repository. This parameter is ignored when running in the root directory of a DVC project.
    * `--no-scm`: Initializes a DVC project separately from Git. This means that DVC doesn't try to find or use Git in the target directory. Some DVC functions are not available in this mode.
    * `-h`, `--help`: Shows Help.
    * `-q`, `--quiet`: Stops writing data to standard output. 0 is output if no problems arise, otherwise 1.
    * `-v`, `--verbose`: Displays detailed tracing information.

    {% endcut %}

* **%dvc_add**: Add files or directories to track in DVC.

    {% cut "Description of command parameters." %}
    * `-R`, `--recursive`: Defines files to add by searching for data files in each target directory and its subdirectories. If there are no directories among the targets, this parameter is ignored.
    * `--no-commit`: Do not save files to cache. In this case, a DVC file is created and an entry is added to .dvc/state.
    * `--file <filename>`: Specifies the name of the generated DVC file. The default name is `<target>.dvc`, where `<target>` is the name of the file to add.
    * `--external`: Allows adding files and folders that are outside of the DVC repository.
    * `-h`, `--help`: Shows Help.
    * `-q`, `--quiet`: Stops writing data to standard output. 0 is output if no problems arise, otherwise 1.

    {% endcut %}

* **%dvc_remove**: Stops tracking files or directories in DVC.

    {% cut "Description of command parameters." %}
    * `--outs`: Additionally deletes data generated at all stages of the target operation. By default, always used for DVC files.
    * `-h`, `--help`: Shows Help.
    * `-q`, `--quiet`: Stops writing data to standard output. 0 is output if no problems arise, otherwise 1.
    * `-v`, `--verbose`: Displays detailed tracing information.

    {% endcut %}

* **%dvc_status**: Show changes in the project pipelines and file mismatches either between the cache and workspace, or between the cache and remote storage.

    {% cut "Description of command parameters." %}
    * `-c`, `--cloud`: Comparisons are made with remote storage.
    * `-a`, `--all-branches`: Compares cache content against all Git branches instead of just the workspace. Applies only if the `--cloud` or `-r` parameter is specified.
    * `-T`, `--all-tags`: The same as `-a`, but applies to Git tags and the workspace. Can be combined with the `-a` parameter, for example, using the `-aT` flag.
    * `-R`, `--recursive`: Defines files for status checks in each target directory and its subdirectories. A search is made in dvc.yaml and DVC files.
    * `--show-json`: Prints the output in JSON format instead of a table.
    * `--all-commits`: The same as `-a` or `-T`, but applies to all Git commits and the workspace. Used for comparing cache content for the entire existing history of the project.
    * `-d, --with-deps`: Defines files to check by tracking dependencies to the targets. If nothing is specified, this parameter is ignored.
    * `-r <name>`, `--remote <name>`: Specifies which remote storage to compare against.
    * `-j <number>`, `--jobs <number>`: Specifies the number of jobs that DVC can use to retrieve information from remote servers. Only applies if the `--cloud` parameter is used or remote access is granted.
    * `-h`, `--help`: Shows Help.
    * `-q`, `--quiet`: Stops writing data to standard output. 0 is output if data is up-to-date, otherwise 1.
    * `-v`, `--verbose`: Displays detailed tracing information.

    {% endcut %}

* **%dvc_checkout**: Update files and directories in the workspace based on current DVC files.

    {% cut "Description of command parameters." %}
    * `--summary`: Displays a summary of changes made by the current command in the workspace.
    * `-R`, `--recursive`: Defines files to update by searching each target directory and its subdirectories for DVC files to check. If there are no directories among the targets, this parameter is ignored.
    * `-d`, `--with-deps`: Defines files to update by tracking dependencies to the target DVC files. If no targets are specified, the parameter is ignored.
    * `-f`, `--force `: Deletes unsaved changes to the workspace.
    * `--relink`: Ensures that the file linking strategy (`reflink`, `hardlink`, `symlink`, or `copy`) for all data in the workspace is consistent with the project's cache.
    * `-q`, `--quiet`: Stops writing data to standard output. 0 is output if no problems arise, otherwise 1.
    * `-v`, `--verbose`: Displays detailed tracing information from executing the `dvc pull` command.

    {% endcut %}

* **%dvc_pull**: Download tracked files or directories from remote storage to the cache and workspace.

    {% cut "Description of command parameters." %}
    * `-a`, `--all-branches`: Defines files to download by checking dvc.yaml and .dvc files in all Git branches instead of just those present in the current workspace.
    * `-T`, `--all-tags`: The same as `-a`, but applies to Git tags and the workspace. Can be combined with the `-a` parameter, for example, using the `-aT` flag.
    * `--all-commits`: The same as `-a` or `-T`, but applies to all Git commits and the workspace. Used for downloading all the data for the entire existing history of the project.

    * `-f`, `--force `: Doesn't prompt when removing workspace files that no longer match the current stages or DVC files.
    * `-r <name>`, `--remote <name>`: Sets the name of the remote storage to pull from.
    * `--run-cache`: Downloads all available history of stage runs from the remote repository into the local run cache.
    * `-j <number>`, `--jobs <number>`: Specifies the number of parallel jobs to download files from remote storage.
    * `-h`, `--help`: Shows Help.
    * `-q`, `--quiet`: Stops writing data to standard output. 0 is output if data is up-to-date, otherwise 1.
    * `-v`, `--verbose`: Displays detailed tracing information.

## Integration with the Git version control system {#git}

To use the version control system, click **Git** in the project window. To work with the system, you can clone an existing repository or initiate a new one, and use all common methods for working with Git. For more information, see [{#T}](../operations/projects/work-with-git.md).
