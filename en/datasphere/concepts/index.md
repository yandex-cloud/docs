# About {{ ml-platform-name }}

{{ ml-platform-full-name }} is a machine learning (ML) development environment that combines the familiar JupyterÂ® Notebook interface, serverless computing technology, and seamless use of different computing resource configurations. {{ ml-platform-full-name }} helps significantly reduce the cost of machine learning compared to computing on your own hardware or other cloud platforms.

If you never used Jupyter Notebook, try it: notebooks are convenient as they help you execute code sequentially and immediately visualize the results. Notebooks are also helpful for making analytical reports and articles: you can add explanations between the code cells in [Markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).

## Advantages of the service {#advantages}

### Ready-to-use development environment {#ready-to-use}

You don't need to spend time creating and maintaining VMs: when you create a new [project](project.md), computing resources are automatically allocated for implementing it.

The VM comes ready with the JupyterLab development environment and pre-installed packages for data analysis and ML (such as TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy), which you can start using immediately. The full list of [pre-installed packages](preinstalled-packages.md).

If you're missing a package, you can [install it](../operations/projects/install-dependencies.md) right from the notebook.

### Automatic maintenance of computing resources {#auto-service}

The service automatically manages resource allocation. If you don't perform any computations, no resources are allocated.

### Saving states at shutdown {#save-state}

If you close the notebook tab, the state of the interpreter, all variables, and computation results are saved. You can continue working when you reopen your project.

### Managing computing resources {#control-computing-resources}

Different computing resources are required for different tasks. For some of them, a regular processor is enough, but for others, you need a GPU.

{{ ml-platform-name }} supports different computing resource [configurations](configurations.md). By default, projects run with the minimal <q>S</q> configuration (32 GB RAM and 2 vCPUs).

You can [change the configuration](../operations/projects/control-compute-resources.md) at any time when working in the notebook. The state of the interpreter is maintained.

### You can share your results {#share-results}

You can [export your notebook as HTML](../operations/projects/publication.md) with all your calculation results and cell explanations and share a link to the report in this format. Exporting in other formats is currently not supported.
