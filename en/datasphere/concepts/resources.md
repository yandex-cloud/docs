# Resources

_Resources_ are files and folders that you can use in [projects](project.md). For example, data for analysis, calculation results, or configuration files. You can upload your files or create them from inside a project.

Resources are stored separately from projects and notebooks. All resources that you [upload](../operations/resources/upload.md) are available from any project [created](../operations/projects/create.md) in the same [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder).

{% include [include](../../_includes/datasphere/update-files.md) %}
