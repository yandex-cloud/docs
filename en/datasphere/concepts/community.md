# Communities in {{ ml-platform-name }}

_Communities_ represent a way to organize team work in {{ ml-platform-name }}. A community determines the scope of projects and resources and helps set up team activities.

Roles determine what the community members can do. A community member may be a _developer_, _editor_, or _administrator_. For a full list of community members, see the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.members }}** tab. Developers can create projects and their resources, run calculations in the IDE, and share resources in the community. Editors can change [settings](../operations/community/manage-community-config.md). Community administrators can invite new members to the community and manage their roles. For more information about roles in {{ ml-platform-name }}, see [this article](../security/index.md).

You can attach to a community [any link](../operations/community/link-channel.md) you want to share with its members.

To create resources and run projects in the IDE, link a {{ yandex-cloud }} [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) to the community. To learn how to do it, see [{#T}](../operations/community/link-ba.md).
