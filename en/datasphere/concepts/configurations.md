# Computing resource configurations

Once you create a project, it runs with the minimum resource configuration: <q>c1.4</q> (4 vCPUs).
You can [change the configuration](../operations/projects/control-compute-resources.md) when working in the notebook. In this case, the state of the interpreter is saved: no variables or computation results are lost.
