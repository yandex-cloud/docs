# Computing resource configurations

Once you create a project, it runs with the minimum resource configuration: <q>c1.4</q> (4 vCPUs).
You can [modify the configuration](../operations/projects/control-compute-resources.md) while using a notebook. In this case, the state of the interpreter is saved: no variables or computation results are lost.

{% note info %}

Since projects run on different {{ yandex-cloud }} platforms with different computing resources, {{ ml-platform-name }} does not guarantee that RAM will be 100% available.
