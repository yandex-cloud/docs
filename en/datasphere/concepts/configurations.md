# Computing resource configurations

Once you create a project, it runs with the minimum resource configuration: <q>c.1.4</q> (4 vCPUs).
You can [modify the configuration](../operations/projects/control-compute-resources.md) while using a notebook. In this case, the state of the interpreter is saved: no variables or computation results are lost.

{% include [configurations](../../_includes/datasphere/migration/configurations.md) %}
