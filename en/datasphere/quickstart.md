# Getting started with {{ ml-platform-name }}

{{ ml-platform-full-name }} is an end-to-end ML development environment where you can use familiar IDEs, serverless computing technology, and seamlessly combine a broad range of {{ yandex-cloud }} computing resource configurations. {{ ml-platform-full-name }} is part of the data platform and offers powerful features to easily interact with {{ yandex-cloud }} services. As an IDE, {{ ml-platform-name }} provides [{{ jlab }}Â® Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

In this section, you'll learn how to:
1. [Create projects](#create-project).
1. [Run projects](#start-project).
1. [Configure the environment](#install-dependencies).
1. [Upload data to projects](#download-data).
1. [Start training](#start-ml).
1. [Share your results](#share-with-community).

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and log in to {{ yandex-cloud }} or register if you don't have an account yet.
1. [On the billing page]({{ link-console-billing }}), make sure you linked a [billing account](../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you don't have a billing account, [create one](../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. Open the [homepage]({{ link-datasphere-main }}) {{ ml-platform-name }}.
1. Accept the user agreement.
1. Select the organization to work with {{ ml-platform-name }} in or create a new one.
