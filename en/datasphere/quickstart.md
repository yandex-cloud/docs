# Getting started with {{ ml-platform-name }}

{{ ml-platform-name }} is a service that simplifies the use of the JupyterLab development environment on {{ yandex-cloud }} computing resources. This lets you perform complex calculations, such as training neural networks or analyzing big data, using the familiar Jupyter Notebook interface.

In this section, you'll learn how to:

1. [Create projects](#create-project) where you'll work in the JupyterLab environment.
1. [Install required packages](#install-dependencies).
1. [Manage computing resources](#control-compute-resources) by changing their configurations.

## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). Then log in to {{ yandex-cloud }} or sign up if you don't have an account yet.
1. On the [Billing]({{ link-console-billing }}), make sure that a [billing account](../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) is linked and that its status is `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE`. If you don't have a billing account, [create one](../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. On the [Access management]({{ link-console-access-management }}) page, make sure you have the `editor` role or higher. The role must be assigned for the folder where you'll work or the cloud that the folder belongs to.
