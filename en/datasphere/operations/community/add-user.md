1. Select the community to add users to.
1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.members }}** tab and click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.add-member }}**.
1. Select one or more users from the list and click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.add }}**.

   If the required user is not on the list, click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.copy-link }}** and send them the copied link in any convenient way.
