# Exporting a project

You can export a project as a ZIP archive. In this case, both a file with a notebook and all files that you see in the **File Explorer** window are exported. This lets you start your notebook locally, provided the environments match.

## Before you begin {#before-begin}

If the project is already open, go to the notebook tab.

If not, open the project:

{% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/before-begin.md) %}

## Export a project {export-project}

To export a project:

1. In the top panel, click **File** and select **Export project as zip**.
1. In the window that opens, click **Download**.

   Wait for the ZIP archive with the project to download.

## What's next {#what-is-next}
