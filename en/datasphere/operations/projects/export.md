# Export a project

You can export a project as a ZIP archive. In this case, both a file with a notebook and all files that you see in the **File Explorer** window are exported. This lets you start your notebook locally, provided the environments match.

## Before you begin {#before-begin}

{% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/ui-before-begin.md) %}

## Export a project {#export-project}

Make sure you've saved the changes. The last saved state is exported.

1. In the top panel, click **File** and select **Export project as zip**.
1. In the window that opens, click **Download**.

   Wait for the ZIP archive with the project to download.
