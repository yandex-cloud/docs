# Exporting a project

You can export a project as a ZIP archive. In this case, both a file with a notebook and all files that you see in the **File Explorer** window are exported. This lets you start your notebook locally, provided the environments match.

## Before you start {#before-begin}

If the project is already open, make sure you save the changes. The last saved state is exported.

If the project isn't open yet:

1. {% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/first-step.md) %}

1. Go to the **Projects** tab.

1. Click the name of the project you want to export.

    Wait for the project to open.

## Export a project {export-project}

To export a project:

1. In the top panel, click **File** and select **Export project as zip**.

1. In the window that opens, click **Download**.

    Wait for the ZIP archive with the project to download.
