# Notebook code snippets

The notebook contains code snippets for simple operations. Use them to extract files from a ZIP archive, to create a dataset, or to connect to file storage. The snippet library is subject to updates, so an up-to-date snippet list is available in the IDE.

## Before you begin {#before-begin}

{% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/ui-before-begin.md) %}
