You can connect to the [Yandex Disk](https://disk.yandex.com) file storage service from the {{ ml-platform-name }} interface.

## Before you begin {#before-begin}

1. [Register](https://yandex.com/dev/id/doc/dg/oauth/tasks/register-client.html) your project as an application in Yandex OAuth:
   1. Go to the [application creation page](https://oauth.yandex.com/client/new) and log in using your [Yandex ID](https://yandex.com/support/id/index.html).
   1. In the **App name** field, specify the name of your project in {{ ml-platform-name }}.
   1. Under **Platforms**, select **Web services**.
   1. In the **Callback URI #1** field, insert `https://oauth.yandex.ru/verification_code`.
   1. Under **Access**, expand **Yandex Disk REST API (cloud_api)** and select all the access permissions offered.
   1. Click **Create app**.
   1. Save the app's ID and password. You'll need them when connecting to Yandex Disk.

   {% note info %}

   When {{ ml-platform-name }} tries to connect to Yandex Disk for the first time, you'll need to go to the Yandex ID login page and copy and paste the confirmation code in the notebook's **Enter the confirmation code** field.
