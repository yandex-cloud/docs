# Creating a directory

You can create directories for grouping uploaded files and accessing them from inside a notebook.

To create a directory:

1. {% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/first-step.md) %}

1. Go to the **Resources** tab.

1. If necessary, select the directory where you want to create a new directory.

1. Click **Create directory**.

1. Enter a name for the directory or its path of multiple subdirectories using `/` as a separator.

    For example, if you specify the `parent/child` path, a directory named `parent` is created with a subdirectory named `child`.
