# Pricing for {{ ml-platform-name }}



## What goes into the cost of using {{ ml-platform-name }} {#rules}

When using {{ ml-platform-name }}, you pay for the use of computing resources: the compute and instance running time is charged per second.

### Running {{ ml-platform-name }} in the {{ ds }} mode {#serverless}

When performing computations and training models in the [{{ ds }} mode](concepts/project.md#serverless), you pay for the compute time. If you do not perform any computational operations in a project, the {{ ml-platform-name }} usage time is not charged. However, if you run computations using {{ dataproc-name }} clusters, they are charged separately. For more information, see [Using {{ dataproc-name }} clusters](#data-proc).

You are separately charged for [data storage](#storage) in datasets and project storage expansion.

### Running {{ ml-platform-name }} in the {{ dd }} mode {#dedicated}

When performing computations and training models in the [{{ dd }} mode](concepts/project.md#dedicated), you pay for the VM usage time since the first computations are run in a notebook until the VM is released regardless of whether any computations were performed after the initial run. If you run computations using {{ dataproc-name }} clusters, they are [charged separately](#data-proc).

You are separately charged for [data storage](#storage) in datasets and project storage expansion.

### Using {{ dataproc-name }} clusters {#data-proc}

The cost of using integration with the {{ dataproc-name }} service takes into account:
* {{ ml-platform-name }} c1.4 configuration computing resources.
   These resources are created for integration with the {{ dataproc-name }} cluster and are charged while computations are running on the cluster.
* The entire lifetime of the {{ dataproc-name }} cluster according to the [{{ dataproc-full-name }} pricing policy](../data-proc/pricing.md).

Learn more about [integration with {{ dataproc-name }}](concepts/data-proc.md).

### Disk space usage {#storage}

Each {{ ml-platform-name }} project has a free-of-charge storage amount. If you increase the project size [quota]({{ link-console-quotas }}), the entire requested [storage capacity](#project-data) exceeding {{ ml-project-size }} is paid for separately. For more information about pricing, see [{#T}](concepts/limits.md).

[Data storage inside datasets](#prices-datasets) is charged separately.

If you need to store large amounts of data, you can use {{ objstorage-full-name }}. In this case, data storage will be charged according to the [{{ objstorage-name }} pricing policy](../storage/pricing.md).

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

The monthly usage rate is based on 720 hours a month.

## Pricing {#prices}

Prices for using configurations apply to [{{ ml-platform-name }} {{ ds }}](concepts/project.md#serverless) and [{{ ml-platform-name }} {{ dd }}](concepts/project.md#dedicated) and when you [use models](../datasphere/concepts/deploy/index.md#node).
