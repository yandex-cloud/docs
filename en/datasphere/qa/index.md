# General questions about {{ ml-platform-name }}

{% include [logs](../../_qa/logs.md) %}

{% include [personal-data](../../_qa/personal-data.md) %}

#### What do I do if I cannot install a package in my project or do not have internet access? {#error-connection}

You might have connection issues if you added a subnet to your project that does not have internet access.

If you need a subnet for your project, [set up an NAT gateway](../../vpc/operations/create-nat-gateway.md) to get internet access.

You can [change or disable](../operations/projects/update.md) the subnet in the project settings.

#### Can I close a tab with a notebook? {#close-notebook-tab}

Yes, you can. If you close the notebook tab, current computations will continue running and the [interpreter state](../concepts/save-state.md), all variables, and computation results will be saved. You can continue working when you reopen your project.

#### Why can't I simultaneously start multiple notebooks in my project? {#parallel-run}

Running notebooks have access to the project storage and can edit files. To avoid conflicts between notebooks accessing the same files during computations, {{ ml-platform-name }} prevents you from starting multiple notebooks at the same time.

#### How do I specify the configuration type for my project? {#instance-type}

Project cells in {{ ml-platform-name }} run with the minimum [resource configuration](../concepts/configurations.md): **c1.4** (4 vCPUs). You can [change configurations](../operations/projects/control-compute-resources.md#config) while using your notebook. The state of the interpreter, variables, and computation results will be saved.

#### How do I resolve the error: <q>The following variables can't be serialized</q>? {#error-variables}

The error says that the system can't serialize the variable. It means that you can't move it when switching to another resource configuration. To avoid the error, run all your computations in the same configuration.

#### If I delete a running cell, will computations stop? {#delete-cell}

No, they will not. Computations will continue even if you delete a cell from the notebook. Before deleting a cell, make sure to stop it. If you have deleted a running cell, stop running calculations. To do this, select **File ⟶ Stop IDE executions** in {{ jlab }}Lab or click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.project-page.stop-ide-executions }}** in the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.project-page.executions }}** widget on the project page.

#### My browser cannot open a {{ ml-platform-name }} project in the IDE. How can I fix this? {#browser}

When opening a project in the IDE, {{ ml-platform-name }} redirects your request to its own host with {{ jlab }}Lab. Modern browsers may block such website behavior if you use more advanced privacy tools, including incognito mode. To open a project in the IDE, turn off the blocking settings:

* **Chrome**: Allow using third-party cookies.
* **Safari**: Uncheck **Website tracking: Prevent cross-site tracking** in **Preferences** ⟶ **Privacy**.
* **Yandex Browser**: Allow using third-party cookies for {{ ml-platform-name }} in the browser settings under **Sites** ⟶ **Advanced site settings**.
