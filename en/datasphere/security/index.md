# Access management in {{ ml-platform-name }}

Access to {{ ml-platform-full-name }} is regulated by assigning permissions in an organization. Organizations are managed using [{{ org-full-name }}](../../organization/).

The list of operations available to {{ ml-platform-short-name }} users is determined by the roles they have. For more information about managing access to {{ yandex-cloud }}, see [{#T}](../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md).

## What resources you can assign roles to {#resources}

Access control is implemented at the level of [communities](../concepts/community.md) and [projects](../concepts/project.md). You can also grant resource access to all community users. The access rights granted apply to the entire hierarchy of resources. For example, if you assign a user a role for a {{ ml-platform-name }} project, all permissions are also valid for resources within this project. Learn more about [relationships between {{ ml-platform-name }} resources](../concepts/resource-model.md).

## How to assign a role {#grant-role}

You can assign a role to a user in the {{ ml-platform-name }} interface:
* [{#T}](../operations/community/add-user.md).
* [{#T}](../operations/projects/add-user.md).
* [Share resources with community members](../operations/index.md#share).

You can also [grant access rights](../../organization/roles.md) through the {{ org-name }} interface.
