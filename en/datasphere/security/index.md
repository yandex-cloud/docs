# Access management

The list of operations available to {{ yandex-cloud }} users is determined by the roles they have. A role is assigned to a user at the folder or cloud level, and nested resources inherit this role.

To allow access to resources in {{ ml-platform-short-name }}, assign the required roles to the user from the list below.

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see [{#T}](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation.
