# Deleting access rules in {{ mtr-name }}

You can delete all access rules applied within the cluster in one step.

{% note info %}

To delete a specific rule, delete its description from the configuration file and apply the changes.

{% endnote %}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  To delete all access rules for a {{ mtr-name }} cluster, run this command:

  ```bash
  {{ yc-mdb-tr }} cluster remove-access-control <cluster_name_or_ID>
  ```

  You can get the cluster ID and name with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  1. Open the current {{ TF }} configuration file describing your infrastructure.
  
      To learn how to create this file, see [Creating a cluster](cluster-create.md).
  
  1. Delete the `yandex_trino_access_control` resource from the configuration file.

  1. Make sure the settings are correct.
  
      {% include [terraform-validate](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/validate.md) %}
  
  1. Confirm updating the resources.
  
      {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}
 
  For more information, see [this {{ TF }} provider guide]({{ tf-provider-mtr-access }}).

- gRPC API {#grpc-api}

  1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and put it in an environment variable:

      {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

  1. {% include [grpc-api-setup-repo](../../_includes/mdb/grpc-api-setup-repo.md) %}

  1. Create a file named `body.json` and paste the following code into it:

      ```json
      {
        "cluster_id": "<cluster_ID>",
        "update_mask": {
          "paths": [
            "trino.access_control"
          ]
        },
        "trino": {
            "access_control": {}
        }
      }
      ```

      Where:

      * `cluster_id`: Cluster ID.
          
          You can get the cluster ID with the [list of clusters](cluster-list.md#list-clusters) in the folder.

      * `update_mask`: List of parameters to update as an array of strings (`paths[]`).

          {% cut "Format for listing settings" %}

          ```yaml
          "update_mask": {
            "paths": [
              "<setting_1>",
              "<setting_2>",
              ...
              "<setting_N>"
            ]
          }
          ```

          {% endcut %}

          {% note warning %}

          When you update a cluster, all parameters of the object you are modifying will take their defaults unless explicitly provided in the request. To avoid this, list the settings you want to change in the `update_mask` parameter.

          {% endnote %}

      * `access_control`: Access rule configuration in the cluster.

  1. Call the [ClusterService.Update](../api-ref/grpc/Cluster/update.md) method, e.g., via the following {{ api-examples.grpc.tool }} request:

      ```bash
      grpcurl \
        -format json \
        -import-path ~/cloudapi/ \
        -import-path ~/cloudapi/third_party/googleapis/ \
        -proto ~/cloudapi/yandex/cloud/trino/v1/cluster_service.proto \
        -rpc-header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
        -d @ \
        {{ api-host-trino }}:{{ port-https }} \
        yandex.cloud.trino.v1.ClusterService.Update \
        < body.json
      ```

  1. Check the [server response](../api-ref/grpc/Cluster/create.md#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation) to make sure your request was successful.
