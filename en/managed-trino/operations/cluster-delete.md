# Deleting a {{ TR }} cluster

You can delete an {{ TR }} cluster if you no longer need it.

## Deleting a cluster {#delete}

Before deleting a cluster, disable its deletion protection if it is enabled.

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you want to delete a cluster.
  1. [Go](../../console/operations/select-service.md#select-service) to **{{ mtr-name }}**.
  1. Click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) for the cluster in question and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.overview.button_action-delete }}**.
  1. In the window that opens, confirm the deletion and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.dialogs.popup-confirm-delete-cluster_button }}**.

- CLI {#cli}

    {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

    {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

    To delete a {{ mtr-name }} cluster, run this command:

    ```bash
    {{ yc-mdb-tr }} cluster delete <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```

    You can get the cluster ID and name with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- REST API {#api}

    1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and put it into an environment variable:

        {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

    1. Call the [Cluster.delete](../api-ref/Cluster/delete.md) method, e.g., via the following {{ api-examples.rest.tool }} request:

        ```bash
        curl \
            --request DELETE \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
            --url 'https://{{ api-host-trino }}/managed-trino/v1/clusters/<cluster_ID>'
        ```

        You can get the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

    1. View the [server response](../api-ref/Cluster/delete.md#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation) to make sure your request was successful.

- gRPC API {#grpc-api}

    1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and put it into an environment variable:

        {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

    1. {% include [grpc-api-setup-repo](../../_includes/mdb/grpc-api-setup-repo.md) %}

    1. Call the [ClusterService/Delete](../api-ref/grpc/Cluster/delete.md) method, e.g., via the following {{ api-examples.grpc.tool }} request:

        ```bash
        grpcurl \
            -format json \
            -import-path ~/cloudapi/ \
            -import-path ~/cloudapi/third_party/googleapis/ \
            -proto ~/cloudapi/yandex/cloud/trino/v1/cluster_service.proto \
            -rpc-header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
            -d '{
                    "cluster_id": "<cluster_ID>"
                }' \
            {{ api-host-trino }}:{{ port-https }} \
            yandex.cloud.trino.v1.ClusterService.Delete
        ```

        You can get the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

    1. View the [server response](../api-ref/grpc/Cluster/create.md#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation) to make sure your request was successful.
