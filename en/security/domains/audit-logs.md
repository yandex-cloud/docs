# Collecting, monitoring, and analyzing audit logs

An audit log is a record of all events in the system, including access to it and operations performed. By collecting and verifying audit logs, you can monitor compliance with the established security procedures and standards and identify vulnerabilities in your security mechanisms.

Events in audit logs occur on different levels:
- [{{ yandex-cloud }} level](#cloud-level): Events that occur with {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.
- [OS level](#os-level).
- [Application level](#app-level).
- [Network level](#network-level) (Flow Logs).

{% note info %}

For more information about {{ k8s }} events, see [Collecting, monitoring, and analyzing audit logs in {{ managed-k8s-full-name }}](./kubernetes.md#collection-monitoring-analysis-audit-logs).

{% endnote %}

## {{ yandex-cloud }} level {#cloud-level}

### Collecting events {#collect}

The main tool for collecting {{ yandex-cloud }} level logs is [{{ at-full-name }}](../../audit-trails/concepts/index.md). The service lets you collect audit logs about events happening to {{ yandex-cloud }} resources and upload these logs to {{ objstorage-full-name }} buckets or {{ cloud-logging-name }} log groups for further analysis or export. For details, see the [instructions](../../audit-trails/quickstart.md) on how to start collecting logs, as well as the [format](../../audit-trails/concepts/format.md) and [reference](../../audit-trails/concepts/events.md) of events.

{% note info %}

See the {{ objstorage-full-name }} security guidelines in [{#T}](secure-config.md#object-storage).

{% endnote %}

 To collect metrics, analyze {{ yandex-cloud }}-level events, and set up notifications, we recommend using [{{ monitoring-full-name }}](../../monitoring/).  It helps you track, for example, a sharp increase in the load on {{ compute-name }}, the number of {{ alb-name }} requests per second (RPS), or significant changes in event statistics in {{ iam-name }}.

You can also use {{ monitoring-name }} to monitor the health of the {{ at-name }} service itself and track security events.

You can export audit logs to a log group in [{{ cloud-logging-name }}](../../logging/) and to [a customer's SIEM system](#export) to analyze information about events and incidents.

### Exporting events to SIEM {#export}

#### {{ at-name }} {#export-at}

Solutions for exporting {{ yandex-cloud }} audit logs are available for the following SIEM systems:

- {{ mes-full-name }} (ELK)

   ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: Collecting, monitoring, and analyzing audit logs in {{ mes-full-name }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/auditlogs/export-auditlogs-to-ELK_main)

- ArcSight

   ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: Collecting, monitoring, and analyzing audit logs in ArcSight SIEM](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/auditlogs/export-auditlogs-to-ArcSight)

- Splunk

   ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: Collecting, monitoring, and analyzing audit logs in Splunk SIEM](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/auditlogs/export-auditlogs-to-Splunk)

Utilities like [GeeseFS](../../storage/tools/geesefs.md) or [s3fs](../../storage/tools/s3fs.md) can help set up export to any SIEM. They allow you to mount an {{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket as a VM's local disk. Next, you need to install a SIEM connector on the VM and configure reading JSON files from the bucket.

#### Metrics {{ monitoring-full-name }}

 You can export metrics to a SIEM system via the API, see the [instructions](../../monitoring/operations/metric/get.md). 

### Responding to events {#respond}

Using {{ sf-full-name }}, you can configure alerts about {{ at-name }} events, as well as automatic responses to malicious actions, including removing dangerous rules or revoking access rights.

## OS level {#os-level}

When using IaaS cloud services and {{ k8s }} node groups, the customer is responsible for ensuring OS security and collecting OS-level events on their own. Free tools for collecting standard OS-generated events and exporting them to the customer's SIEM system include:
  - [Osquery](https://osquery.io/)
  - [Filebeat (ELK)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-system.html)
  - [Wazuh](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/getting-started/use_cases/log_analysis.html)

Additional event generation options can be implemented using Auditd for Linux or Sysmon for Windows.

 You can collect Linux system metrics (CPU, RAM, and disk space usage) with [{{ unified-agent-short-name }}](../../monitoring/concepts/data-collection/unified-agent/index.md) {{ monitoring-name }}. 

You can also export OS events to {{ cloud-logging-name }} using a [Fluent Bit plugin](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/fluent-bit-plugin-yandex).

To describe events to be searched for in audit logs, we recommend using [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) format, which is supported by popular SIEM systems. The Sigma repository contains a [library of events](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules) described in this format.

## Application level {#app-level}

Customers may collect events that occur at the level of applications deployed on {{ compute-name }} resources on their own. For example, save application logs to files and transfer them to a SIEM system using the tools listed in [{#T}](#os-level) above.

## Network level {#network-level}

Currently, {{ vpc-short-name }} network traffic event logs (Flow Logs) can only be collected by customers. You can use {{ marketplace-full-name }} solutions (such as [NGFW](/marketplace?tab=software&search=NGFW), [IDS/IPS](/marketplace?tab=software&search=IDS%2FIPS), or  [network products](/marketplace?categories=network)) or free software for collecting and transmitting events.

## Time synchronization {#time-synch}

To get the exact time of OS- and application-level events, configure clock synchronization by following the [instructions](../../compute/tutorials/ntp.md).
