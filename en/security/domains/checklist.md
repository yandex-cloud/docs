# Security checklist

## Network security {#network-security}

* **Segmentation**: Split resources into groups and put them in different folders or, if strict isolation is required, different {{ vpc-short-name }}. The traffic inside a {{ vpc-short-name }} is allowed by default and is not allowed between {{ vpc-short-name }} (it is only allowed via VMs with two network interfaces in different networks, VPN or {{ interconnect-full-name }}). Watch our webinar to learn [how a network works in {{ yandex-cloud }}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3cZ0o50qH0).
* **Network access restriction, security groups**: Restrict network access across resources using [security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-create.md).
  ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: Setting up security groups (dev/stage/prod) using {{ TF }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/network-sec/segmentation)
* **NGFW from {{ marketplace-short-name }}**: If more robust network protection is required, use [NGFW](/marketplace?tab=software&search=NGFW) from {{ marketplace-full-name }}.
  ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: Installing an NGFW on a {{ yandex-cloud }} VM: Check Point](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/network-sec/checkpoint-1VM)
* **Secure access from outside the cloud infrastructure (VPN)**: If you need remote access to cloud resources, configure a site-to-site VPN (see [this guide](../../tutorials/routing/ipsec-vpn.md) to learn how to set it up using the strongSwan daemon) or use [{{ interconnect-name }}](../../interconnect/). You can also leverage the GOST VPN service.

![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: Creating a site-to-site VPN connection to {{ yandex-cloud }} using {{ TF }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/network-sec/vpn)


* **Secure remote administrator access (VPN)**: Set up a VPN connection between remote devices and {{ yandex-cloud }} using solutions from {{ marketplace-name }}. See the [setup instructions](../../tutorials/routing/openvpn.md) for [OpenVPN](/marketplace/products/yc/openvpn-access-server).
* **Bastion host**: Create a bastion VM to access the infrastructure using control protocols (for example, SSH or RDP).
* **Outbound access (NAT)**: Use an [NAT gateway](../../vpc/concepts/gateways.md#nat-gateway) to ensure secure outbound internet access. The gateway translates your IP addresses to a shared address pool. If internet access should be from your controlled IP address pool, use a [NAT instance](../../tutorials/routing/nat-instance.md#create-nat-instance) (a dedicated VM).
* **DDoS protection**: When assigning public IP addresses to your cloud resources, use the [{{ ddos-protection-full-name }}](../../vpc/ddos-protection/index.md) service by clicking the button (L4 DDoS protection). If you need L7 DDoS protection, contact your account manager.

## Authentication and access control {#authentication}

* **Centralized management and identity federations**: Create an organization in [{{ org-full-name }}](/services/organization) and set up Single Sign-On in {{ yandex-cloud }} via your IdP server. See the setup instructions for [AD FS](../../organization/operations/federations/integration-adfs.md), [Keycloak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oe7V9PvC4), and [Google Workspace](../../organization/operations/federations/integration-gworkspace.md).
* **Federated accounts**: Use federated accounts instead of Yandex accounts whenever possible.
* **Principle of least privilege**: Assign service roles (for example, `compute.images.user`) instead of primitive roles (`viewer`, `editor`, or `admin`). See a [list of all roles](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) and [examples of assigning roles](../../iam/operations/roles/grant.md). Watch our webinar [Managing cloud access permissions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VwSfPZ6eRM&t=3s).
* **{{ TF }} {{ yandex-cloud }} {{ iam-full-name }} module**: Organize access groups for cloud users.
  ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: {{ iam-name }} in {{ TF }} for {{ yandex-cloud }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/auth_and_access/iam#identity-and-access-management-iam-terraform-module-for-yandexcloud)
* **Working with service accounts**: [Assign a service account to a VM instance](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/auth-inside-vm.md) and get a token using the metadata service. Set up a local firewall on the VM instance so that only the necessary processes and system users have access to the metadata service (IP address: 169.254.169.254).<!-- tbd: добавить ссылку на решение -->
* **2FA**: For an identity federation, set up 2FA on the side of your IdP. For a Yandex account, set up 2FA using [this guide](https://yandex.com/support/id/authorization/twofa.html).
* **billing.accounts.owner protection**: After performing the initial operations, don't use an account with this role. To manage a billing account, assign the `admin`, `editor`, or `viewer` role for the billing account to a specific employee with a federated account.
* **resource-manager.clouds.owner protection**: Assign the `resource-manager.clouds.owner` role to employees with federated accounts. Set a strong password for the Yandex account that was used to create the cloud, and use it only when absolutely necessary. Grant administrators less privileged access and use `resource-manager.clouds.owner` only when absolutely necessary.
* **Resource model**: Place all critical resources that must be compliant with standards in a separate cloud. Divide resource groups by folders. Host shared resources (such as network and security groups) in a separate shared resource folder.

## Data encryption and key/secret management {#data-encryption}

* **Encryption in {{ objstorage-full-name }}**: Enable bucket encryption (server-side encryption). See the [instructions](../../storage/operations/buckets/encrypt.md). This encryption protects bucket data from being published on the internet.
* **VM disk encryption (if required)**.
  ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: VM disk encryption using {{ kms-full-name }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/encrypt_and_keys/encrypt_disk_VM)
* **Client-side encryption (if required)**: Use data encryption with {{ kms-name }} keys. See an [overview of encryption methods](../../kms/tutorials/encrypt/index.md).
* **{{ kms-name }} key protection**: Grant only granular access to individual {{ kms-name }} keys (the `kms.keys.encrypterDecrypter` role). Use [key rotation](../../kms/concepts/version.md).
* **Secret management**: Use secret management services, such as [{{ lockbox-name }}](../../lockbox/) or [HashiCorp Vault with {{ kms-name }} support](/marketplace/products/yc/vault-yckms) from {{ marketplace-name }}.<!-- или контейнер {{ registry }}/yc/vault -->

## Secure configuration {#secure-configuration}

* **Default passwords**: Keep track of default passwords in VM software organizationally and technically using various vulnerability scanners.
* **Standards and baseline**: Configure the OS and software in accordance with the baseline and standards (such as CIS and PCI DSS). To automate compliance, use, for example, [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/getting-started/).
* **Disabling the serial console**: Do not use the serial console; if you still have to, [evaluate your risks](../../compute/operations/serial-console/index.md) and disable it once you are done.
* **Safe use of {{ TF }}**: Use `terraform remote state` based on {{ objstorage-name }} with a lock function in {{ ydb-full-name }}. You can see a setup example [here](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/examples/tree/master/terraform-ydb-state). Set [sensitive = true](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/outputs.html#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output) if required. Do not transfer private data to the configuration; if you still have to, use [secret management](https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-managing-secrets-in-your-terraform-code-1d586955ace1#:~:text=this%20blog%20post%3A-,Do%20not%20store%20secrets%20in%20plain%20text.,secrets%20into%20your%20Terraform%20code) services or environment variables. You can read more [here](./secure-config.md#terraform).

* **Integrity control on guest OS**: Use free host-based solutions, such as Wazuh or Osquery, or paid solutions from {{ marketplace-name }}.
* **Secure configuration of {{ objstorage-name }}**: Use encryption, [bucket policies](../../storage/concepts/policy.md), and ACLs, or [versioning for deletion protection](../../storage/concepts/versioning.md), enable [built-in access auditing](../../storage/operations/buckets/enable-logging.md) and configure CORS (if necessary).
  ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: Secure configuration of {{ objstorage-name }} in {{ TF }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/configuration/hardering_bucket)
* **Secure configuration of {{ sf-full-name }}**: Provide a service account token via the [native authentication mechanism](../../functions/operations/function-sa.md) using the assigned service account and metadata. If possible, use [private functions](../../functions/operations/function/function-private.md).
* **Secure configuration of {{ container-registry-full-name }}**: We do not recommend using privileged containers to run loads. Use the built-in image [vulnerability scanner](../../container-registry/concepts/vulnerability-scanner.md).
* **{{ certificate-manager-full-name }}**: Use [{{ certificate-manager-name }}](../../certificate-manager/) to store, receive, and update TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt® and to upload your own certificates. The service is integrated with {{ api-gw-full-name }}, {{ alb-full-name }}, and {{ objstorage-name }}.

## Protection against malicious code {#malicious-code-protection}

* **OS-level protection**: Install antivirus solutions from [{{ marketplace-name }}](/marketplace?categories=security) on VMs.
* **Network-level protection**: Use NGFW/IDS/IPS available in [{{ marketplace-name }}](/marketplace?categories=security) (some of them have built-in sandboxes).
* **Container image-level protection**: Use the image vulnerability scanner integrated with {{ container-registry-name }}.<!-- tbd: вставить ссылку на инструкцию, когда она появится -->

## Managing vulnerabilities {#vulnerability-management}

* **Automated vulnerability scanning**: Use free network scanners, such as Nmap, OpenVAS, and OWASP ZAP, or host-based solutions, such as Wazuh and Tripwire.
* **External security scans**: Perform scans according to the [rules](../compliance/pentest.md).
* **Software and OS updates**: Install updates manually and use automated update tools.
* **Web Application Firewall**: Install a WAF from [{{ marketplace-name }}](/marketplace?categories=security) or use Managed WAF — contact your account manager to get access.
  ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: PT Application Firewall built on {{ yandex-cloud }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/vuln-mgmt/unmng-waf-ptaf-cluster)
  ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Example: Installing a Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) in {{ yandex-cloud }} using {{ TF }} to test Managed WAF](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/vuln-mgmt/vulnerable-web-app-waf-test)

## Collecting, monitoring, and analyzing audit logs {#logs-analysis}

* **{{ at-full-name }}**: Enable [{{ at-name }}](../../audit-trails/quickstart.md) for all clouds and folders.
* **Collecting events on the guest OS and applications side**: Collect events, for example, using [{{ mes-full-name }}](../../managed-elasticsearch/) or free solutions, such as Osquery and Wazuh.
* **Collecting Flow logs (if required)**: For example, using NGFW from {{ marketplace-name }} or free software (options are available in service plans).
* **Exporting {{ at-name }} events to SIEM**.

## Security {{ managed-k8s-full-name }} {#kubernetes-security}

### Data encryption and key/secret management {#kubernetes-data-encryption}

* **Server-side encryption**: Enable secret encryption in etcd. See the [tutorial](../../kms/tutorials/k8s.md). Do this at all times, regardless of whether you use secret management services or not.
* **Secret management**: Use [{{ lockbox-name }}](../../lockbox/) or [HashiCorp Vault with {{ kms-name }} support](/marketplace/products/yc/vault-yckms) from {{ marketplace-name }}.<!-- или контейнер `{{ registry }}/yc/vault` -->
  ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: Secret management using SecretManager ({{ lockbox-name }}, Vault)](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/kubernetes-security/encrypt_and_keys/secret-management)

### Network security {#kubernetes-network-security}

* **Security groups**: Configure security groups for {{ k8s }}. See the [instructions](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/connect/security-groups.md). We don't recommend granting public access and public addresses to {{ k8s }} components.
* **Ingress controller**: To access {{ k8s }} services from outside, use a LoadBalancer (internal or external) Ingress controller (HTTPS): [{{ alb-name }} Ingress Controller](../../managed-kubernetes/tutorials/alb-ingress-controller.md) or other solutions, such as [NGINX Ingress Controller](../../managed-kubernetes/tutorials/ingress-cert-manager.md).
* **DDoS protection**: Create an IP address with DDoS protection and assign it to the service or Ingress controller.
* **Network policy**: Restrict access at the {{ k8s }} level using [Calico network policies](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/calico.md) or advanced [Cilium network policies](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/cilium.md).
* **Access only from a limited pool of addresses (if required)**: Assign security groups for the {{ alb-name }} Ingress controller and use network policies for other Ingress controllers.

### Authentication and access control {#kubernetes-authentication}

* **Access control**: Configure roles to access {{ k8s }}. See the [instructions](../../managed-kubernetes/security/index.md#sa-annotation). Control access rights of the node group's service account (the `container-registry.images.puller` role is usually enough).
  ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: Setting up role models and policies in {{ managed-k8s-name }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/kubernetes-security/auth_and_access/role-model-example)

### Secure configuration {#kubernetes-secure-configuration}

* **Node group configuration according to baseline and standards**: Configure node groups according to standards and baseline: NIST, CIS, and other. You can use automated tools, such as kube-bench and kubescape.
* **Runtime security and policy engine**: Use runtime security solutions, such as Falco, as well as policy engine solutions, such as OPA Gatekeeper and Kyverno.
  ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: Installing Falco and a policy engine with alerts delivered to {{ mes-name }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/auditlogs/export-auditlogs-to-ELK_k8s)
* **Security updates**: Select a relevant [update channel](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/release-channels-and-updates.md) and enable automatic or manual installation of updates immediately after publication in the selected channel. Also perform timely updates of your own software on node groups.
* **Distribution of pods into different node groups**: Configure node taints and tolerations + node affinity (by load and degree of privacy).

### Collecting, monitoring, and analyzing audit logs {#kubernetes-logs-analysis}

* **Collecting and analyzing {{ k8s }} audit logs and security tools**.
  ![](../../_assets/overview/solution-library-icon.svg)[Solution: Analyzing {{ k8s }} security logs in {{ mes-name }}: audit logs, a policy engine, and Falco](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yc-solution-library-for-security/tree/master/auditlogs/export-auditlogs-to-ELK_k8s)
* **Collecting and analyzing audit logs of workloads and node groups**: For example, using open-source tools, such as Fluent Bit and Beats.


* **Monitoring abnormal loads**: Use [{{ monitoring-full-name }}](../../monitoring/).


### Backups {#kubernetes-backup}

* **Backups**: Configure {{ k8s }} cluster backups in {{ objstorage-name }}. See the [tutorial](../../managed-kubernetes/tutorials/backup.md). Follow the recommendations in [Secure configuration of {{ objstorage-name }}](secure-config.md#object-storage).
