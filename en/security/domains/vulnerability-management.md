# Vulnerability management

{{ yandex-cloud }} is responsible for managing vulnerabilities and security updates in managed services. The client is responsible for managing vulnerabilities and security updates for all other system components.

For an example of a scope of responsibility for managing vulnerabilities and security updates, see **Requirement 5** in the [PCI DSS responsibility matrix](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yc-compliance/certificates/PCI_DSS_responsibility_matrix-new.pdf).

## Scanning for vulnerabilities {#vulnerability-scanning}

We recommend that clients scan their own hosts for vulnerabilities. Cloud resources support the installation of custom virtual images of vulnerability scanners or software agents on hosts. There are many fee-based and free solutions for scanning.

Network scanners scan hosts that are accessible over a network. Generally, authentication can be configured on network scanners. Examples of free network scanners:
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
- [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/)
- [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)

Example of a free scanner that operates as an agent on hosts: [Wazuh](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/capabilities/vulnerability-detection/how_it_works.html). Wazuh can also be used as a host-based intrusion detection system (IDS).

## Performing external security scans {#external-security-scans}

Customers hosting their own software in {{ yandex-cloud }} can perform external security scans for the hosted software, including penetration tests. You can run your own scans or use contractors. For more information, see [{#T}](../compliance/pentest.md).

## Managing security updates {#security-updates-management}

A client must perform their own security updates within their scope of responsibility. Various automated tools are available for centralized automated OS and software updates.

{{ yandex-cloud }} publishes [security bulletins](../security-bulletins/index.md) to notify customers of newly discovered vulnerabilities and security updates.

## Web Application Firewall (WAF) {#waf}

To mitigate risks associated with web attacks, we recommend using a Web Application Firewall (WAF). A client can install and maintain a WAF independently or use the Managed WAF service.

### Installing a WAF on your own

[WAF](/marketplace?tab=software&search=waf) images are available from the [{{ marketplace-full-name }}](/marketplace). License types and other required information are available in the product descriptions.

You can also install Wallarm WAF in [{{ managed-k8s-name }}](../../managed-kubernetes/index.yaml). See the [instructions](https://docs.wallarm.com/admin-en/installation-kubernetes-en/) in the Wallarm documentation. This is a BYOL licensing model (a license purchased from a third-party vendor).

### Managed WAF {#managed-waf}

A customer receives a cloud WAF as a service from {{ yandex-cloud }}. They are provided access to a personal account and the ability to view statistics and perform management. To activate the service and get detailed information, contact your account manager, the [sales department](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/#contact-form), or [support]({{link-console-support}}?section=contact). The service is provided in partnership with Qrator.
