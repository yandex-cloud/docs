# Rules for performing external security scans

{{ yandex-cloud }} users can perform external security scans, including penetration tests, for the software they host in the cloud. {{ yandex-cloud }} customers can carry out these scans themselves or have a contractor do it for them.

The scan rules are described in detail in the Acceptable Use Policy: [Rules for performing external security scans]{% if lang == "ru" %}(https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_pentest/){% endif %}{% if lang == "en" %}(https://yandex.com/legal/cloud_pentest/){% endif %}.{% if product == "yandex-cloud" %} To perform a scan, you need an active [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md).{% endif %}

You can ask additional questions about performing scans when negotiating your request.
