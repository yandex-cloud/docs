Applications using Log4j 1.x are only vulnerable to this attack when they use [JNDI](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/lookups.html#JndiLookup). If so, make sure your logging configuration has no `JMSAppender` configured.

#### Log4j 2.x

* Java 8 (and later): Upgrade to Log4j 2.16.0.
* Java 7: Upgrade to release Log4j 2.12.2 as soon as it is available.
* If you're still using previous versions, remove the `JndiLookup` class from the classpath: `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`.

Note that only the `log4j-core JAR` file is affected by this vulnerability. Applications using only the `log4j-api JAR` file without the `log4j-core JAR` file are not affected by this.

If you placed Hystax Acura Controller behind a network load balancer in your infrastructure, apply the above firewall rule to the respective load balancer.

## 12.11.2021: CVE-2021-22205: Remote code execution via a vulnerability in {{ GL }}

### Description

In {{ GL }} versions starting 11.9, a [security issue](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22205) was discovered, which resulted in a remote command execution. An attack may be carried out by sending two requests that require no authentication.

The vulnerability is caused by not properly validating uploaded image files by an external file parser using the ExifTool library ([CVE-2021-22204](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22204)).

The issue is fixed in {{ GL }} versions 13.10.3, 13.9.6, and 13.8.8.

### Impact on {{ yandex-cloud }} services

The vulnerability affects all {{ compute-full-name }} users using a deprecated {{ GL }} image from {{ marketplace-full-name }} or a custom image. These users need to upgrade {{ GL }} to the latest version.

To fix the issue on the {{ yandex-cloud }} side, the following measures were taken:

* The {{ GL }} image has temporarily been removed from {{ marketplace-full-name }} and will be updated to the current version.
* Notifications with update recommendations were sent to all users using a deprecated {{ GL }} image.

{{ mgl-full-name }} users are not affected by the vulnerability, since the service uses the current {{ GL }} version.

### Compensatory measures

If you're using a deprecated {{ GL }} image from {{ marketplace-full-name }} or a custom image, [update](https://about.gitlab.com/update) it to the latest version. If for some reason you can't update the {{ GL }} version, use a [hotpatch](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/cve-2021-22205-how-to-determine-if-a-self-managed-instance-has-been-impacted/60918#hotpatch-2).

### Description

A [security issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104980) was discovered in Kubernetes, which allows unauthorized access to a node's filesystem when a user logs in to a cluster.

### Impact on {{ yandex-cloud }} services

{{ managed-k8s-full-name }} does not provide anonymous cluster access and is not affected by the vulnerability from an external attacker.

### Compensatory measures

To remove the attack vector from an internal attacker, update all existing service clusters and node groups to version 1.19 or higher. If your clusters and node groups are already updated to version 1.19 or higher, update the revisions. An update that fixes the bug is available in all release channels.

We also recommend that you:

* Automatically update your clusters and node groups to the latest versions or revisions.
* Schedule manual updates at least once a month if you can't apply automatic updates.
* Disable running pods as root for untrusted uploads.

To do this, you can use the following tools:
* [OPA Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library/tree/master/library/pod-security-policy/users)
* [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/restricted/require-run-as-nonroot/require-run-as-nonroot/)
