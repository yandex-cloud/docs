# Stopping and starting {{ OS }} clusters

If necessary, you can stop and restart {{ OS }} clusters. When a cluster is stopped, all data in it is retained: it will be available again when you restart the cluster.

You are not charged for the time when your cluster is stopped, but you still pay for the storage size based on the [pricing policy](../pricing.md).
