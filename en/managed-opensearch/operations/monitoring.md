## Monitoring cluster status {#monitoring-cluster}

To view detailed information about the {{ mos-name }} cluster status:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder page and select **{{ mos-name }}**.
   1. Click the name of the cluster you need and select ![image](../../_assets/monitoring.svg) **Monitoring**.

      The page displays the following charts:

      * **Health status**: Shows the cluster's health and technical condition:

         * `0` (red): Cluster is unhealthy or partially functional. At least one of the [primary shards](../concepts/scalability-and-resilience.md) is unavailable. If the cluster responds to queries, the search results will be incomplete.
         * `1` (yellow): Cluster is healthy. There is no access to at least one of the replica shards. The search results in the cluster responses are complete; however, if there are more unavailable shards, the cluster performance will be disrupted.
         * `2` (green): Cluster is healthy. All cluster shards are available.

      * **Active shards**: Number of active primary shards and the total number of active shards in the cluster.
      * **Other shards**: Number of inactive shards in each of the following states:

         * `Delayed unassigned`: Host assignment is delayed.
         * `Unassigned`: There is no assigned host.
         * `Relocating`: Moving to another host.
         * `Initializing`: Being initialized.

      * **Nodes**: Number of hosts with the `DATA` [role](../concepts/host-roles.md#data).
      * **Segments**: Number of index segments per host.
      * **Pending tasks**: Number of enqueued tasks.
      * **Indexing rate**: Number of indexing operations per second, per host.
      * **Search rate**: Number of search queries per second, per host.

## Monitoring the state of hosts {#monitoring-hosts}

To view detailed information about the status of individual {{ mos-name }} hosts:

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder page and select **{{mos-name }}**.
1. Click the name of the cluster you need and select ![image](../../_assets/mdb/hosts.svg) **Hosts**.
1. Select the **Monitoring** tab.
1. Select the host from the drop-down list.

This page displays charts showing the load on an individual host in the cluster. Which charts are exactly displayed depends on the host type:

## Monitoring the state of host groups {#monitoring-host-groups}

To view detailed information about the state of a {{ mos-name }} host group:

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder page and select **{{mos-name }}**.
1. Click the name of the cluster you need and select ![image](../../_assets/mdb/host-groups.svg) **Host groups**.
1. Select the **Monitoring** tab.
1. Select the host group you need from the drop-down list.

This page displays charts showing the load on the cluster's host group. Which charts are exactly displayed depends on the type of hosts in the group; this is in line with the [charts shown for individual hosts](#monitoring-hosts).


## Alert settings in {{ monitoring-full-name }} {#monitoring-integration}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder with the cluster you wish to configure alerts for.
   1. In the list of services, select ![image](../../_assets/monitoring.svg) **{{ monitoring-short-name }}**.
   1. Under **Service dashboards**, select:

      * **{{ mos-name }}** to configure cluster alerts.
      * **{{ mos-name }} — Dashboards** to configure alerts for hosts with the `DASHBOARDS` role.
      * **{{ mos-name }} — Data** to configure alerts for hosts with the `DATA` role.

   1. In the chart you need, click ![options](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **Create alert**.
   1. If there are multiple metrics on a chart, select a data query to generate a metric and click **Continue**. For more information about the query language, see the [{{ monitoring-full-name }} documentation](../../monitoring/concepts/querying.md).
   1. Set the `Alarm` and `Warning` threshold values to trigger the alert.
   1. Click **Create alert**.

{% endlist %}

{% include [other-indicators](../../_includes/mdb/other-indicators.md) %}

Recommended threshold values:

| Metric | Parameter | Formula | `Alarm` | `Warning` |
|----------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| Cluster status | `opensearch_status` | `bottom_last(1)` | `Equal to 0` | `Equal to 1` |
| Number of unassigned shards | `opensearch_unassigned_shards` | `top_last(1)` | `Greater than 0` |                                   |
| Number of relocated shards | `opensearch_relocating_shards` | `top_last(1)` | `Greater than 0` |                                   |
| Number of initialized shards | `opensearch_initializing_shards` | `top_last(1)` | `Greater than 0` |                                   |
| Number of delayed assignment shards | `opensearch_delayed_unassigned_shards` | `top_last(1)` | `Greater than 0` |                                   |
| JVM heap memory used | `opensearch_jvm_mem_heap_used_percent` | `top_last(1)` | Over 90% of host RAM |                                   |
| Storage space used | `opensearch_fs_total_used_percent` | `top_last(1)` | Over 90% of the storage size | Over 85% of the storage size |
| Using the JVM long-lived object pool | `opensearch_jvm_mem_heap_pressure` | `top_last(1)` | Over 90% of host RAM | Over 75% of host RAM |
| Storage space used | `disk.used_bytes` | N/A | 90% of storage size | 80% of storage size |

For the `disk.used_bytes` metric, the values of the `Alarm` and `Warning` metrics are only set in bytes. For example, here are the recommended values for a disk of 100 GB:

* `Alarm`: `96636764160` bytes (90%).
* `Warning`: `85899345920` bytes (80%).

You can view the host's current storage size and RAM amount in the [detailed information about the cluster](cluster-list.md#get-cluster). For a complete list of supported metrics, see the [{{ monitoring-name }} documentation](../../monitoring/metrics-ref/index.md#managed-opensearch).
