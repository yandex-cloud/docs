# Resource relationships in {{ mmg-name }}

The main entity used in {{ mmg-name }} is a _database cluster_.

Each cluster consists of one or more _database hosts_, which are virtual machines with DBMS servers deployed on them. Cluster hosts may reside in different availability zones and even different availability regions. You can learn more about {{ yandex-cloud }} availability zones [here](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).

* A cluster consisting of multiple hosts supports automatic failover, as each hosts can take the primary replica role.

* The cost of a single-host cluster is lower, but it does not guarantee fault tolerance.

When creating a cluster, specify:
* _Host class_: VM template for deploying the cluster hosts. For a list of available host classes and their specs, see [{#T}](instance-types.md).

* _Environment_: Environment where the cluster will be deployed:
   * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
   * `PRESTABLE`: For testing, including the {{ mmg-short-name }} service itself. The prestable environment is updated first with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, not every update ensures backward compatibility.

* _{{ MG }} edition_: For a list of available editions and supported features, see [{#T}](./editions.md).


A cluster created in a folder can be accessed by all VMs connected to the same cloud network. For more information about networking, see the [{{ vpc-name }} documentation](../../vpc/).
