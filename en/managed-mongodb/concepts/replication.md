# Replication and fault tolerance {{ MG }}

{{ mmg-name }} supports replication by default: if a cluster has multiple active hosts, they automatically select a primary replica to process write queries.

When [changing the primary replica](../operations/stepdown.md) manually, {{ MG }} will automatically select a new primary replica from the available hosts.

For more information about how replication works in {{ MG }}, read [its documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/).

## Fault tolerance {#Fault-tolerance}

For cluster hosts to be able to automatically select the primary replica when needed, the vast majority of hosts need to be healthy. As a result, it is more cost-efficient to deploy clusters with an odd number of hosts when working with {{ mmg-name }}. For example, a cluster with three hosts can lose one host and keep working. At the same time, a cluster with four hosts can also lose only one host: if a second host is lost, the remaining hosts will not be enough to select a new primary replica.

A cluster with two hosts does not ensure full fault tolerance for the same reason: a single remaining host cannot select itself as primary replica. In this situation, the cluster can only handle read queries.
