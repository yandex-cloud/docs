# {{ MG }} settings

For {{ mmg-name }} clusters, you can configure settings that relate to {{ MG }}.

The label next to the setting name helps determine which interface is used to set the value of this setting: the management console, CLI, API, or Terraform. The {{ tag-all }} label indicates that all of the above interfaces are supported.

Depending on the selected interface, the same setting is represented differently. For example, **Max incoming connections** in the management console matches:

* `max_incoming_connections` in gRPC, CLI, or Terraform.
* `maxIncomingConnections` in the REST API.

## Settings dependency on the host class {#settings-instance-dependent}

Values of some {{ MG }} settings can be automatically adjusted when you change the host class:

* If the values weren't set or aren't suitable for the new class, the default settings for this class are applied.
* If the manually set settings are suitable for the new class, they don't change.

List of settings that depend on the host class:

* [Net → Max incoming connections](#setting-max-incoming-connections).
* [Engine config → Cache size gb](#setting-engine-cache-size).
