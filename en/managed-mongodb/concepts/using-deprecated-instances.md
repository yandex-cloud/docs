# Using deprecated host classes

As of June 1, 2020, the `s1.nano` host class is deprecated for {{ mmg-short-name }}.

What this means for service users:

- Now you can't change the host class to `s1.nano` for your cluster.

- You can still operate your cluster if it uses the `s1.nano` class, but you can't [add new hosts](../operations/hosts.md) of any class to such a cluster.

  To be able to add hosts to the cluster, [change the host class](../operations/update.md#change-resource-preset) to a [supported class](instance-types.md).

  For example, you can migrate from `s1.nano` to:
  - `s2.micro`: The most affordable host class with 100% guaranteed vCPU performance. Contains twice as many resources as `s1.nano`.
  - `b2.medium`: The closest host class in terms of computing resources. Costs less than `s1.nano`, but the guaranteed vCPU performance is lower: 50% instead of 100%.

- [Pricing rules](../pricing.md) for previously created `s1.nano` hosts don't change.

- [You can restore a cluster from a backup](../operations/cluster-backups.md) only to [existing host classes](instance-types.md).

  You can't restore a cluster from a backup to `s1.nano` hosts even if the backup was made from a cluster with these hosts.
