# Sharding collections {{ MG }}

Sharding in {{ mmg-name }} is available for clusters running {{ MG }} version 4.0 or higher. If your cluster is deployed with version 3.6, you can [update it](../operations/cluster-version-update.md).

Please note that when you shard a {{ mmg-name }} cluster, mongos and mongocfg service hosts are automatically created and [billed](../pricing.md) separately from the main DBMS hosts.

It makes sense to shard collections when splitting data into shards significantly helps improve DBMS performance or data availability. To increase availability, each shard should consist of 3 or more database hosts.

Ease of use and actual performance improvements depend strongly on the sharding key you choose: make sure that the data of the collection is logically distributed across shards and isn't linked to data in different shards.

You should use sharding if:

* Significantly large volumes of data. Consider sharding if your collection is 200 GB or more.
* Collections with non-uniform contents. For example, data can be clearly classified as frequently queried and rarely queried.
* Collections requiring high read and write speeds. Sharding helps distribute workloads among hosts to bypass technical limitations.

For more information about the sharding concept, see [{#T}](../concepts/sharding.md).

## How to enable collection sharding {#enable}

{% note important %}

Run all your sharding setup commands via the `mongo` CLI from a user granted the [mdbShardingManager](../concepts/users-and-roles.md#mdbShardingManager) role in the [admin](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-admin-database) database.

{% endnote %}

1. Open a {{ mmg-name }} cluster page in [консоли управления]({{ link-console-main }}).

1. Go to the **Shards** tab and click **Enable**.

1. Specify the host class, storage type and size, and subnets for shard hosts (mongocfg and mongos).

1. Connect to the mongos host using the `mongo` CLI and enable sharding:

   ```
   sh.enableSharding(<database name>)
   ```

1. Define an index for the sharded collection:

   ```
   db.<collection name>.ensureIndex( { "<index>": "hashed" } )
   ```

1. Enable collection sharding:

   ```
   sh.shardCollection( "<collection>", { "<index>": "hashed" } )
   ```

   For a detailed description of the `shardCollection`  command, see the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.shardCollection/#definition).

1. Modify applications that use your database to **only** use the mongos hosts.

## Example of sharding {#example}

Let's say you already have a {{ mmg-name }} sharded cluster hosting the `billing` database. Your task is to enable sharding for the `payment` and `addresses` collections. In the example, the `payment` index hash and the value of the `addresses` field are used as the shard key.

Sequence of operations:

1. [Connect](../operations/connect.md) to the `billing` database. Make sure that the user connecting to the database has the [mdbShardingManager](../concepts/users-and-roles.md#mdbShardingManager) role in the [admin](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-admin-database) database.

1. Enable `billing` database sharding:

   ```
   sh.enableSharding("billing")
   ```

1. Define the index for the sharded collection:

   ```
   db.payments.ensureIndex( { "_id": "hashed" } )
   ```

1. Create the necessary number of shards in [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

1. Shard the collection based on its namespace:

   ```
   sh.shardCollection( "billing.payments", { "_id": "hashed" } )
   ```

Sharding is now enabled and configured. To make sure, try listing the available shards using the command `db.adminCommand( { listShards: 1 } )`.
