# Version update {{ MG }}

You can upgrade {{ mmg-name }} clusters to versions 4.0, 4.2, or 4.4.

You can upgrade only to the version that immediately follows the current one, namely:

- From version 3.6 to version 4.0.
- From version 4.0 to version 4.2.
- From version 4.2 to version 4.4.

You need multiple steps to upgrade between versions that are farther apart. For example, to upgrade a cluster from 4.0 to 4.4, you need two steps: 4.0 → 4.2 → 4.4.

{% note info %}

In April 2021, clusters running {{ MG }} 3.6 will be [forcibly upgraded](../qa/general.md#dbms-deprecated) to version 4.0 due to the version 3.6 [End of Life](https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy). We recommend that you upgrade to the latest {{ MG }} versions in advance.

{% endnote %}

## Before upgrading {#before-update}

Prior to upgrading a cluster, make sure this doesn't affect your applications:

1. View the revision history for {{ MG }} versions [4.0](https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.0/release-notes/4.0/), [4.2](https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.0/release-notes/), or [4.4](https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.4/release-notes/4.4/) and check if any of the revisions may affect your applications.
1. Try upgrading a test cluster (you can try [deploying](cluster-backups.md#restore) it from a backup of the main cluster).
1. [Back up](cluster-backups.md#create-backup) the main cluster prior to upgrading.

## Upgrading a cluster {#start-update}

To upgrade a {{ mmg-name }} cluster:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console
  1. Open the **{{ mmg-name }}** page in the folder with the cluster to be updated.
  1. Select the cluster from the list and click **Edit cluster**.
  1. In the **Version** field, click *4.0*, *4.2*, or *4.4*.
  1. Click **Save changes**.

  Once the update is launched, the cluster status changes to **UPDATING**. Wait for the operation to complete and then check the cluster version.

- CLI

  1. Get a list of your {{ MG }} clusters using the command:

     ```bash
     yc managed-mongodb cluster list
     ```

  1. Get information about a cluster and check the {{ MG }} version in the `config.version` parameter:

     ```bash
     yc managed-mongodb cluster get <cluster ID>
     ```

  1. Start the {{ MG }} update:

     ```bash
     yc managed-mongodb cluster update <cluster ID> --mongodb-version=<new version ID>
     ```

     When the update starts, the cluster status switches to **UPDATING**. Wait for the operation to complete and then check the cluster version.

  1. After the update, all the MongoDB features that are not backward-compatible with the previous version are disabled. To remove this restriction, run the command:

     ```bash
     yc managed-mongodb cluster update <cluster ID> --feature-compatibility-version=<new version ID>
     ```

     Learn more about backward compatibility in the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/).

- API

  You can update the {{ MG }} version for a cluster using the [update](../api-ref/Cluster/update.md) API method: pass the appropriate value in the `configSpec.poolerConfig.poolingMode` request parameter.

  After the update, all the MongoDB features that are not backward-compatible with the previous version are disabled. To remove this restriction, use the API [update](../api-ref/Cluster/update.md) method: pass the new version number in the request using the `configSpec.featureCompatibilityVersion` property.

  Learn more about backward compatibility in the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/).

{% endlist %}

## Examples {#examples}

Let's say you need to update the cluster from version 3.6 to version 4.0.

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   1. To get a list of clusters and find out the cluster ID, run the command:

      ```
      $ yc managed-mongodb cluster list
      +----------------------+---------------+---------------------+--------+---------+
      |          ID          |     NAME      |     CREATED AT      | HEALTH | STATUS  |
      +----------------------+---------------+---------------------+--------+---------+
      | c9q8p8j2gaih8iti42mh |   mongodb406  | 2019-04-23 12:44:17 | ALIVE  | RUNNING |
      +----------------------+---------------+---------------------+--------+---------+
      ```

   1. To get information about the `c9qut3k64b2o9umqogr7` cluster, run the command:

      ```
      $ yc managed-mongodb cluster get c9qut3k64b2o9umqogr7
        id: c9qut3k64b2o9umqogr7
        folder_id: b1g0itj57rbjk9thrinv
        created_at: "2019-07-16T09:43:50.393231Z"
        name: mongodb406
        environment: PRODUCTION

        config:
          version: "3.6"
          feature_compatibility_version: "3.6"
          ...
      ```

   1. To update the `c9qutgkd4b2o9umqog97` cluster to version 4.0, run the command:

      ```bash
      $ yc managed-mongodb cluster update c9qutgkd4b2o9umqog97 --mongodb-version=4.0
      ```

   1. To enable all 4.0 features in the `c9qutgkd4b2o9umqog97` cluster, run the command:

      ```bash
      $ yc managed-mongodb cluster update c9qutgkd4b2o9umqog97 --feature-compatibility-version=4.0
      ```
