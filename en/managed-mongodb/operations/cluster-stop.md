# Stopping and starting {{ MG }} clusters

You can stop and restart a DB cluster, if required. You are not charged for the time when your cluster is stopped: you only continue to pay for the storage size and backups based on the [pricing policy](../pricing.md#prices-storage).

## Stopping a cluster {#stop-cluster}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.
   1. Select the desired cluster in the list, click ![options](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg), and select **Stop**.
   1. Confirm that you want to stop the cluster and click **Stop**.

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To stop a cluster, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-mg }} cluster stop <cluster name or ID>
   ```

   You can request the cluster ID or name with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

   To stop a cluster, use the [stop](../api-ref/Cluster/stop.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/Stop](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#Stop) gRPC API call and provide the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter.

   The cluster ID can be requested with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

   To start a cluster, use the [start](../api-ref/Cluster/start.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/Start](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#Start) gRPC API call and provide the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter.
