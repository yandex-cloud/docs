# Managing backups in {{ mmg-name }}

You can create [backups](../concepts/backup.md) and restore clusters from existing backups.

{{ mmg-name }} also creates automatic daily backups. You can [set the backup start time and retention period](update.md#change-additional-settings).

## Restoring clusters from backups {#restore}

Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) technology lets you restore the cluster state to any point in time between when the oldest backup was created and when the most recent oplog was archived. For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/backup.md).

For example, if the backup operation ended on August 10, 2020, 12:00 p.m. UTC, the current date is August 15, 2020, 7:00 p.m. UTC, and the latest `oplog` was saved on August 15, 2020, 6:50 p.m. UTC, the cluster can be restored to any state between August 10, 2020, 12:00:01 p.m. UTC and August 15, 2020, 6:50:00 p.m. UTC, inclusive.

{% note warning %}

* PITR only works for clusters with {{ MG }} version 4.2 and higher.
* PITR is not supported for clusters with [sharding](../tutorials/sharding.md) enabled. Such clusters can be restored only to the point in time when the selected backup was created.

{% endnote %}

When you restore a cluster from a backup, you create a new cluster with data from the backup. If the folder has insufficient [resources](../concepts/limits.md) to create such a cluster, you will not be able to restore from the backup. The average backup recovery speed is 10 MBps.

For a new cluster, you should set all the parameters that are required at creation, except for the cluster type (a {{ MG }} backup cannot be restored as a {{ PG }} cluster).

When restoring to the current state, the new cluster will reflect the state of:

* An existing cluster at the time of recovery.
* A deleted cluster at the time of archiving the last oplog.

- Management console

   To restore an existing cluster from a backup:

   1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.

   1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and select ![image](../../_assets/mdb/backup.svg) **Backup copies**.

   1. Click ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) for the desired backup and then click **Restore cluster**.

   1. Set up the new cluster. You can select a folder for the new cluster from the **Folder** list.

   1. Click **Restore cluster**.

   To restore a previously deleted cluster from a backup:

   1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.

   1. On the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/mdb/backup.svg) **Backups**.

   1. Find the desired backup using the backup creation time and cluster ID. The **Name** column contains the IDs in `<cluster ID>:<backup ID>` format.

   1. Click ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) for the desired backup and then click **Restore cluster**.

   1. Set up the new cluster. You can select a folder for the new cluster from the **Folder** list.

   1. Click **Restore cluster**.

   {{ mmg-name }} launches the operation to create a cluster from the backup.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To restore a cluster from a backup:

   1. View a description of the CLI restore {{ MG }} cluster command:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-mg }} cluster restore --help
      ```

   1. Getting a list of available {{ MG }} cluster backups:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-mdb-mg }} backup list
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      +--------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+---------------------+--------+-----------+
      |            ID            |     CREATED AT      |  SOURCE CLUSTER ID   |     STARTED AT      |  SIZE  |   TYPE    |
      +--------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+---------------------+--------+-----------+

      | ...                                                                                         |                    |
      +--------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+---------------------+--------+-----------+
      ```

      The time when the backup was completed is shown in the `CREATED AT` column with a list of available backups, in `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss` format (`2020-08-10 12:00:00` in the example above). You can restore a cluster to any point in time starting with creation of its backup.

   1. Run the command to create a new cluster from a backup (the example shows only some parameters):

      
      ```bash
       {{ yc-mdb-mg }} cluster restore \
          --backup-id <backup ID> \
          --recovery-target-timestamp <point in time> \
          --mongodb-version <{{ MG }} version> \
          --name <name of new cluster> \
          --environment <environment: PRESTABLE or PRODUCTION> \
          --network-name <network name> \
          --host zone-id=<availability zone>,`
                `subnet-id=<subnet ID> \
          --mongod-resource-preset <host class> \
          --mongod-disk-size <storage size in GB> \
          --mongod-disk-type <disk type>
      ```


      In the `--recovery-target-timestamp` parameter, specify the point in time to which you want to restore the {{ MG }} cluster in [UNIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) format. If you don't specify the parameter, the cluster is restored to when the backup was completed.

- API

   To restore an existing cluster from a backup, use the [restore](../api-ref/Cluster/restore.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/Restore](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#Restore) gRPC API call and provide the following in the request:

   * ID of the desired backup, in the `backupId` parameter. To find out the ID, [retrieve a list of cluster backups](#list-backups).
   * Name of the new cluster that will contain the data recovered from the backup, in the `name` parameter. It must be unique within the folder.

   In the `recoveryTargetSpec.timestamp` parameter, specify the point in time to which you want to restore the {{ MG }} cluster in [UNIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) format. If you don't specify the parameter, the cluster is restored to when the backup was completed.
