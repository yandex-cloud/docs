# Managing shards

You can enable [sharding](../concepts/sharding.md) for a cluster as well as add and configure individual shards.

Make sure that your shards consist of at least 3 `MONGOD` hosts to ensure higher availability. We don't recommend sharding small collections: query processing is faster with a standard replica cluster.

{% note alert %}

After [cluster sharding](../concepts/sharding.md) is enabled:

- You can't disable sharding: the cluster will always maintain a minimum number of `MONGOS`, `MONGOCFG`, or `MONGOINFRA` hosts depending on the [sharding type](../concepts/sharding.md#shard-management).
- For accessing the databases, only use the `MONGOS` or `MONGOINFRA` hosts that route queries to shards. For this purpose, edit host addresses in your application code accordingly.

{% endnote %}

## Enabling sharding {#enable}

The {{ mmg-name }} interface lets you quickly create a [{{ MG }} sharding infrastructure](../concepts/sharding.md#shard-management).

To learn how to directly shard your {{ MG }} database and collections, see [{#T}](../tutorials/sharding.md).

To enable sharding, you need:

* At least 3 `MONGOINFRA` hosts for standard sharding.
* At least 2 `MONGOS` and 3 `MONGOCFG` hosts for advanced sharding.

{% note info %}

Sharding is [not supported](../concepts/sharding.md#shard-management) for hosts with the classes **b1.nano**, **b1.micro**, **b1.medium**, **b2.nano**, **b2.micro**, or **b2.medium**. If you don't see the **Shards** tab, [increase the cluster host class](update.md#change-resource-preset) to the supported value.

{% endnote %}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.

   1. Click on the name of a cluster and open the **Shards** tab.

   1. Click **Enable**.

   1. Select a sharding type:
      - **Standard**: Using a `MONGOINFRA` host.


      - **Advanced**: Using `MONGOS` and `MONGOCFG` hosts.


         For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/sharding.md).

      {% note warning %}

      After you enable sharding, you can't change its type.

      {% endnote %}

   1. Set the parameters of the hosts that will provide access to the sharded data.

   1. Click **Enable sharding**.

   The cluster will start updating, with the requested hosts and first shard of the cluster created.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}
