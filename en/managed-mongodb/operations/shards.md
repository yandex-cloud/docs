# Managing shards

You can enable [sharding](../concepts/sharding.md) for a cluster as well as add and configure individual shards.

{% note alert %}

After [cluster sharding](../concepts/sharding.md) is enabled:

- You can't disable sharding: the cluster will always maintain a minimum number of `MONGOS`, `MONGOCFG`, or `MONGOINFRA` hosts depending on the [sharding type](../concepts/sharding.md#shard-management).
- For accessing the databases, only use the `MONGOS` or `MONGOINFRA` hosts that route queries to shards. For this purpose, edit host addresses in your application code accordingly.

{% endnote %}

Make sure that your shards consist of at least 3 hosts to ensure higher availability. We don't recommend sharding small collections: query processing is faster with a standard replica cluster.

## Enabling sharding {#enable}

The {{ mmg-name }} interface lets you quickly create a [{{ MG }} sharding infrastructure](../concepts/sharding.md#shard-management).

To learn how to directly shard your {{ MG }} database and collections, see [{#T}](../tutorials/sharding.md).

{% note info %}

Sharding is [not supported](../concepts/sharding.md#shard-management) for hosts with the classes **b1.nano**, **b1.micro**, **b1.medium**, **b2.nano**, **b2.micro**, or **b2.medium**. If you don't see the **Shards** tab, [increase the cluster host class](update.md#change-resource-preset) to the supported value.

{% endnote %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.

   1. Click the name of a cluster and open the **Shards** tab.

   1. Click **Enable**.

   1. Select a sharding type:
      - **Standard**: Using a `MONGOINFRA` host.

         To ensure continuous access to data, {{ mmg-name }} requires at least three `MONGOINFRA` hosts.

      - **Advanced**: Using `MONGOS` and `MONGOCFG` hosts.

         To ensure continuous access to data, {{ mmg-name }} requires at least two `MONGOS` hosts and at least three `MONGOCFG` hosts.

         For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/sharding.md).

      {% note warning %}

      After you enable sharding, you can't change its type.

      {% endnote %}

   1. Set the parameters of the hosts that will provide access to the sharded data.

   1. Click **Enable sharding**.

   The cluster will start updating, with the requested hosts and first shard of the cluster created.

- API

   You can enable sharding for the cluster using the [enableSharding](../api-ref/Cluster/enableSharding.md) method.

## Listing shards in a cluster {#list-shards}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.

   1. Click the name of a cluster and open the **Shards** tab.

- API

   To list the shards in a cluster, use the [listShards](../api-ref/Cluster/listShards.md) method.

{% endlist %}

## Adding a shard {#add-shard}

The number of shards in {{ mmg-short-name }} clusters is limited by the CPU and RAM quotas available to DB clusters in your cloud. To check the resources in use, open the [Quotas]({{ link-console-quotas }}) page and find **{{ mmg-full-name }}**.

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.
   1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and go to the **Hosts** tab.
   1. Click **Add shard**.
   1. Enter a name for the shard and add the number of hosts you need.
   1. Click **Create shard**.

- API

   To add a host to the cluster, use the [addShard](../api-ref/Cluster/addHosts.md) method.

{% endlist %}


## Deleting a shard {#delete-shard}

You can delete a shard from a {{ MG }} cluster provided that it's not the only shard in it. To replace the only shard in a cluster, first create a new shard and then remove the old one.

{% note info %}

The [removeShard](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/removeShard/) operation will be called for the shard being deleted and will safely transfer data to the remaining shards.

{% endnote %}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.
   1. Click on the name of a cluster and open the **Shards** tab.
   1. Click the ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) icon in the same row as the desired host and select **Delete**.
   1. In the window that opens, click **Delete**.

- API

   Use the [deleteShard](../api-ref/Cluster/deleteShard.md) method to delete a host.
