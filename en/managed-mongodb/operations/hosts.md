# Managing hosts in a cluster

You can add and remove cluster hosts, resync the hosts, and [manage settings {{ MG }}](update.md) for individual clusters.

## Getting a list of cluster hosts {#list-hosts}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.

  1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and select the **Hosts** tab.

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  To get a list of cluster hosts, run the command:

  ```
  $ {{ yc-mdb-mg }} host list
       --cluster-name <cluster name>
  
  +----------------------------+--------------+--------+------------+--------------+----------+---------------+-----------+
  |            NAME            |  CLUSTER ID  |  TYPE  | SHARD NAME |     ROLE     |  HEALTH  |    ZONE ID    | PUBLIC IP |
  +----------------------------+--------------+--------+------------+--------------+----------+---------------+-----------+
  | rc1b...mdb.yandexcloud.net | c9qp71dk1... | MONGOD | rs01       | PRIMARY      | ALIVE    | ru-central1-b | false     |
  | rc1c...mdb.yandexcloud.net | c9qp71dk1... | MONGOD | rs01       | SECONDARY    | ALIVE    | ru-central1-c | false     |
  +----------------------------+--------------+--------+------------+--------------+----------+---------------+-----------+
  ```

  You can query the cluster name with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

  To get a list of cluster hosts, use the [listHosts](../api-ref/Cluster/listHosts.md) method.

{% endlist %}

## Adding a host {#add-host}

The number of hosts in {{ mmg-short-name }} clusters is limited by the CPU and RAM quotas available to DB clusters in your cloud. To check the resources in use, open the [Quotas]({{ link-console-quotas }}) page and find the **{{ mmg-full-name }}** block.

You can add different types of hosts to a cluster. Their number depends on the [sharding type](../concepts/sharding.md):

{#hosts-table}

| Shard type | MONGOD | MONGOINFRA | MONGOS | MONGOCFG |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| No sharding | ⩾ 1 | — | — | — |
| Standard | ⩾ 1 | ⩾ 3 | — | — |
| Advanced | ⩾ 1 | — | ⩾ 2 | ⩾ 3 |

{% list tabs %}

- Management console
  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.
  1. Click on the name of the cluster you need and go to the **Hosts** tab.
  1. Click **Add host**.

  {% if audience != "internal" %}

  1. Specify the host parameters:

      * Availability zone.

      * Subnet (if the necessary subnet is not in the list, [create it](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md)).

      * Select the **Public access** option if the host must be accessible from outside {{ yandex-cloud }}.

      * Host type and shard name, if [sharding](../concepts/sharding.md) is enabled for the cluster.

  {% endif %}

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  To add a host to the cluster:

  {% if audience != "internal" %}

  1. Request a list of cluster subnets to select one for the new host:

      ```
      $ yc vpc subnet list
      
      +-----------+-----------+------------+---------------+------------------+
      |     ID    |   NAME    | NETWORK ID |     ZONE      |      RANGE       |
      +-----------+-----------+------------+---------------+------------------+
      | b0cl69... | default-c | enp6rq7... | ru-central1-c | [172.16.0.0/20]  |
      | e2lkj9... | default-b | enp6rq7... | ru-central1-b | [10.10.0.0/16]   |
      | e9b0ph... | a-2       | enp6rq7... | ru-central1-a | [172.16.32.0/20] |
      | e9b9v2... | default-a | enp6rq7... | ru-central1-a | [172.16.16.0/20] |
      +-----------+-----------+------------+---------------+------------------+
      ```

     If the necessary subnet is not in the list, [create it](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md). {% endif %}

  1. See the description of the CLI command for adding a host:

     ```
     $ {{ yc-mdb-mg }} host add --help
     ```

  1. Run the add host command:

      ```
      $ {{ yc-mdb-mg }} host add
           --cluster-name <cluster name>
           --host zone-id=<availability zone>,subnet-id=<subnet ID>
      ```

      {{ mmg-short-name }} will run the add host operation.

      The subnet ID should be specified if the availability zone contains multiple subnets, otherwise {{ mmg-short-name }} automatically selects a single subnet. You can retrieve the cluster name with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

  To add a host to the cluster, use the [addHosts](../api-ref/Cluster/addHosts.md) method.

{% endlist %}

## Deleting a host {#remove-host}

You can remove a `MONGOD` host from a {{ MG }} cluster if it is not the only host in it. To replace a single host, first create a new host and then remove the old one.

If the host is a primary one at the time of removal, {{ mmg-short-name }} automatically selects a new primary replica.

From a [sharded](../operations/shards.md#enable) cluster, you may remove the `MONGOS`, `MONGOCFG`, or `MONGOINFRA` hosts that exceed the [minimum number](#hosts-table) needed for sharding.

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.

  1. Click on the name of the cluster you want and select the **Hosts** tab.

  1. Click ![image](../../_assets/vertical-ellipsis.svg) in the line of the necessary host and select **Delete**.

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  To remove a host from the cluster, run:

  ```
  $ {{ yc-mdb-mg }} host delete <host name>
       --cluster-name <cluster name>
  ```

  The host name can be requested with a [list of cluster hosts](#list-hosts), and the cluster name can be requested with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

  To remove a host, use the [deleteHosts](../api-ref/Cluster/deleteHosts.md) method.

{% endlist %}

## Starting host resync {#resetup}

To [resync a host](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member/) with other replicas in the {{ mmg-name }} cluster or shard, run forced resync. The operation can be applied to only one `MONGOD` host at a time and only for clusters with more than two replicas, regardless of the host class and type. Resync also lets you remove the collections and documents that were marked as deleted from the host's storage.

During this operation:

1. The host stops accepting write requests. If the host was a `PRIMARY` replica, {{ mmg-short-name }} will try to [make it a `SECONDARY` replica](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown). If the operation fails, it is aborted.

1. The MongoDB instance on the host stops and all data is deleted.

1. The MongoDB instance restarts and downloads data from replica hosts again.

1. After the host has synced with other replicas in the cluster, it becomes a secondary replica.

   {% note info %}
   * During syncing, the host can't fully respond to any request, because it has only part of the {{ mmg-name }} cluster data.
   * Estimated sync rate: 300 GB per day or more.

   {% endnote %}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  To forcibly resync a host, run the following command:

  ```
  $ {{ yc-mdb-mg }} hosts resetup <host_name>
     --cluster-name <cluster name>
  ```

  You can obtain the host name with a [list of hosts in the folder](hosts.md#list-hosts). The cluster name can be requested with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
