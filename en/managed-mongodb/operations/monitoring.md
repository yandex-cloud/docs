## Monitoring the state of hosts {#hosts}

To view detailed information about the status of individual {{ mmg-name }} hosts:

1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ mmg-name }}**.
1. Click the name of the desired cluster and select **Hosts** → **Monitoring**.
1. Select the host from the drop-down list. You'll see the host role (`PRIMARY` or `SECONDARY`) and type (`MONGOCFG`, `MONGOD`, `MONGOINFRA`, or `MONGOS`) next to the host name.

This page displays charts showing the load on an individual host in the cluster:

* **CPU**: The load on processor cores. As the load goes up, the **Idle** value goes down.
* **Memory**: Use of RAM, in bytes. At high loads, the value of the **Free** parameter goes down while those of other parameters go up.
* **Disk bytes**: The speed of disk operations (bytes per second).
* **Disk IOPS**: Number of disk operations per second.
* **Network bytes**: Speed of data exchange over the network, in bytes per second.
* **Network packets**: Number of packets exchanged over the network, per second.


## Alert settings in {{ monitoring-full-name }} {#monitoring-integration}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder with the cluster you wish to configure alerts for.

   1. In the list of services, select ![image](../../_assets/monitoring.svg) **{{ monitoring-short-name }}**.

   1. Under **Service dashboards**, select:

        * **{{ mes-name }}** to configure cluster alerts.
        * **{{ mes-name }} Host Overview** to configure host alerts.

   1. In the chart you need, click ![options](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **Create alert**.

   1. If there are multiple metrics on a chart, select a data query to generate a metric and click **Continue**. For more information about the query language, see the [{{ monitoring-full-name }} documentation](../../monitoring/concepts/querying.md).

   1. Set the `Alarm` and `Warning` threshold values to trigger the alert.

   1. Click **Create alert**.

{% endlist %}

{% include [other-indicators](../../_includes/mdb/other-indicators.md) %}

Recommended threshold values:

| Metric | Parameter                      | `Alarm`                   | `Warning`                 |
|---------------------------------|:-------------------------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| DB write availability | `can_write`                      | `Equals 0`                 | —                         |
| Replication delay              | `replset_status-replicationLag` | `180`,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, | `30`,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, |
| Storage space used | `disk.used_bytes`                | 90% of storage size  | 70% of storage size  |

For the `disk.used_bytes` metric, the values of the `Alarm` and `Warning` metrics are only set in bytes. For example, here are the recommended values for a disk of 100 GB:

* `Alarm`: `96636764160` bytes (90%).
* `Warning`: `75161927680` bytes (70%).

You can view the current storage size in [detailed information about the cluster](cluster-list.md#get-cluster). For a complete list of supported metrics, see the [{{ monitoring-name }} documentation](../../monitoring/metrics-ref/index.md#managed-mongodb).


### Monitoring the switch to read-only mode {#read-only-alert}

To monitor storage usage on cluster hosts and get notifications when free space is about to run out:

1. [Create an alert](../../monitoring/operations/alert/create-alert.md).
1. Add the `disk.free_bytes` status metric.

   To do this, create a query in the query builder:

   `service={{ mmg-name }}` → `name=disk.free_bytes` → `host=*` → `resource_id=*` → `resource_type=cluster`.

1. Set the alert threshold values in the alert settings:
   * **Trigger condition**: Set the `Less than or equal to` condition for the size of free disk space to trigger the alert.

      Recommended threshold values depending on the storage size:

      | Storage size, GB | `Alarm` | `Warning` |
      |---------------------|-------------|------------------|
      | ⩽ 600 | `1G` (1 GB) | `1500M` (1.5 GB) |
      | > 600 | `6G` (6 GB) | `10G` (10 GB) |

   * **Additional settings** → **Aggregation function**: Select the `Minimum` value (the minimum metric value for the period).

## Cluster state and status {#cluster-health-and-status}
