```
POST https://{{ api-host-mdb }}/managed-mongodb/v1/clusters/{clusterId}/shards
```

## Path parameters

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| clusterId | **string**

Required field. ID of the MongoDB cluster to add a shard to.
To get the cluster ID, use a [ClusterService.List](/docs/managed-mongodb/api-ref/Cluster/list#List) request. ||
|#

## Body parameters {#yandex.cloud.mdb.mongodb.v1.AddClusterShardRequest}

```json
{
  "shardName": "string",
  "hostSpecs": [
    {
      "zoneId": "string",
      "subnetId": "string",
      "assignPublicIp": "boolean",
      "type": "string",
      "shardName": "string",
      "hidden": "boolean",
      "secondaryDelaySecs": "string",
      "priority": "number",
      "tags": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| shardName | **string**

Required field. Name of the MongoDB shard to create. ||
|| hostSpecs[] | **[HostSpec](#yandex.cloud.mdb.mongodb.v1.HostSpec)**

Configurations for mongod hosts to be created with the shard. ||
|#

## HostSpec {#yandex.cloud.mdb.mongodb.v1.HostSpec}

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| zoneId | **string**

ID of the availability zone where the host resides.
To get a list of available zones, use the [yandex.cloud.compute.v1.ZoneService.List](/docs/compute/api-ref/Zone/list#List) request. ||
|| subnetId | **string**

ID of the subnet that the host should belong to. This subnet should be a part
of the network that the cluster belongs to.
The network ID is set in the [Cluster.networkId](/docs/managed-mongodb/api-ref/Cluster/get#yandex.cloud.mdb.mongodb.v1.Cluster) field. ||
|| assignPublicIp | **boolean**

Whether the host should get a public IP address on creation.

After a host has been created, this setting cannot be changed. To remove an assigned public IP, or to assign
a public IP to a host without one, recreate the host with `assignPublicIp` set as needed.

Possible values:
* false - don't assign a public IP to the host.
* true - the host should have a public IP address. ||
|| type | **enum** (Type)

Type of the host to be deployed.

- `TYPE_UNSPECIFIED`: Type of the host is unspecified. Default value.
- `MONGOD`: A mongod host.
- `MONGOS`: A mongos host.
- `MONGOCFG`: A mongocfg host.
- `MONGOINFRA`: A mongoinfra (mongos+mongocfg) host. ||
|| shardName | **string**

Name of the shard that the host belongs to. ||
|| hidden | **boolean**

Is host hidden in replSet ||
|| secondaryDelaySecs | **string** (int64)

The number of seconds "behind" the primary that this replica set member should "lag" ||
|| priority | **number** (double)

Priority of host for the election in replSet ||
|| tags | **string**

Host tags ||

```

An Operation resource. For more information, see [Operation](/docs/api-design-guide/concepts/operation).

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| id | **string**

ID of the operation. ||
|| description | **string**

Description of the operation. 0-256 characters long. ||
|| createdAt | **string** (date-time)

Creation timestamp.

String in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format. The range of possible values is from
`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` to `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z`, i.e. from 0 to 9 digits for fractions of a second.

To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the
[Protocol Buffers reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/overview).
In some languages, built-in datetime utilities do not support nanosecond precision (9 digits). ||
|| createdBy | **string**

ID of the user or service account who initiated the operation. ||
|| modifiedAt | **string** (date-time)

The time when the Operation resource was last modified.

String in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format. The range of possible values is from
`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` to `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z`, i.e. from 0 to 9 digits for fractions of a second.

[Protocol Buffers reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/overview).
In some languages, built-in datetime utilities do not support nanosecond precision (9 digits). ||
|| done | **boolean**

If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. ||
|| metadata | **[AddClusterShardMetadata](#yandex.cloud.mdb.mongodb.v1.AddClusterShardMetadata)**

Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.
It typically contains the ID of the target resource that the operation is performed on.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. ||
|| error | **[Status](#google.rpc.Status)**

The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||
|| response | **[Shard](#yandex.cloud.mdb.mongodb.v1.Shard)**

The normal response of the operation in case of success.
If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete,
the response is [google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty).
If the original method is the standard Create/Update,
the response should be the target resource of the operation.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the response type, if any.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||
