# How to participate in the partner program

The partner program enables you to make profit and grow your own business by addressing customer needs using the {{ yandex-cloud }} platform. You can become a partner through either the [VAR](./program/var.md) or the [referral](./program/referral.md) partnership program, as well as participate in both programs at once.

The partner program will enable you to:

* Promote your own solutions based on {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* Sell your solutions to new customers and boost demand among your current ones.
* Deliver integrated projects by offering pro-level services.

Becoming a partner is a multi-step process.

## Step 1. Go to the onboarding page {#step-1}

See the onboarding page for the procedure of getting the partner status:

1. On [the partner program page](https://yandex.cloud/ru/partners), click [**Apply**]({{ link-cloud-partners }}welcome).
1. Learn about the steps of getting the partner status and the partner program benefits and click **Let's get started!**.

## Step 2. Sign in {#step-2}

To sign in, you need a Yandex ID or SSO account in {{ yandex-cloud }}. You can sign in using any of these methods:

* Using an existing account. You will see a list of your recently used {{ yandex-cloud }} accounts. In the next step, you will be able to select the organization within that account to use for your work.
* Creating a new Yandex ID. The system will automatically create a {{ yandex-cloud }} organization for you.
* Using SSO. Use this method if you have an [identity federation](../organization/concepts/add-federation.md) configured in {{ yandex-cloud }}. The organization in which the identity federation was created will be used to access the partner portal.

## Step 3. Submit your partnership application {#step-3}

In your [partnership application]({{ link-cloud-partners }}onboarding-new), provide your contact details and company information for initial verification.

1. Make sure to select the {{ yandex-cloud }} organization you plan to work with under the partner program from the drop-down list at the top of the page.

   * If your organization has a billing account that meets [these requirements](#restrictions), you can use it to submit company information.
   * If there is no billing account, you will see a warning in the **Company information** section and will be able to create one at [Step 5](#step-5).

1. Supply the company info: your **Contact details** and **Company information**. Completing the **Company information** section depends on whether you have a billing account:

   * If you have one, select it from the list and verify that the information is accurate. Once you select an account at this step, you will not be able to change it.
   * If you do not have a billing account, enter your business TIN (INN). A card with business info will appear. Click it to check that all data in the **Additional information** section is accurate.

1. Click **Send request**.

## Step 4. Select the partnership type {#step-4}

1. Watch the information video about our {{ yandex-cloud }} partner program until the end.
1. When done, you will be able to select the partnership type (you can select both options):

   * [Referral partner](program/referral.md): Refers clients to {{ yandex-cloud }} using a referral link for a 10% partner commission. All paperwork and project works are managed by {{ yandex-cloud }}.

     {% note info %}

     To get your referral partnership application approved, [provide your bank account details](../billing/qa/billing-account.md#checking-account) in your billing account.

     {% endnote %}

   * [Direct partner](program/var.md): Implements integrated projects based on {{ yandex-cloud }} services: creates and maintains customer infrastructure, manages paperwork, develops the expertise and products of their own.

1. Provide the **Company's taxation type ** info and click **Continue**.
1. Fill out the questionnaire about your company’s profile. Click **Send**.

## Step 5. Select a billing account {#step-5}

If you have already provided a billing account at [Step 3](#step-3), proceed to the next step. If no payment account was specified, you can create one at this step.

Billing account requirements: {#restrictions}

* Billing account type: [Business account](../billing/concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types).
* A business account issued to a business residing in the Russian Federation.
* Payment method: **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.create-new.payment-type_label_invoice }}**.

1. Click **Create billing account**.

1. On the **General information** page, specify the following:

   * **Account name**: Enter a name for your billing account.
   * **Country**: **Russia**.
   * **Payer**: The system will create a new payer and populate this field automatically.
   * **Account type**: **Business or individual entrepreneur**.
   * **Payment method**: **Wire transfer**.

   Click **Next**.

1. Fill out the **Company information** section: make sure the automatically populated fields contain accurate information and complete all required fields. Click **Next**.

1. The **Contacts** page will show the contacts from [Step 3](#step-3). If you need to specify a different payer in the billing account, update the information on this page. Click **Create**.

1. Fill out the [form](https://forms.yandex.ru/surveys/10033352.3c456c5feb5c56ed6c3112834db3233af1434edc/?language=ru&resident_ru=ru_ru) to verify your newly created billing account.

1. [Upgrade](../billing/operations/activate-commercial.md) you billing account from the trial period to the paid version. When upgrading to the paid version, your grants are preserved with your account and you can use them to pay for your services.

   {% note info %}

   Upgrading from the trial to the paid version involves no extra payments or fees. You will only start getting bills if billable resources appear in the cloud linked to your billing account.

   {% endnote %}

## Step 6. Get a confirmation from {{ yandex-cloud }} {#step-6}

On the application confirmation page, you can view your application's details and follow its status. Please wait for the manager's feedback and approval of your application: this may take up to seven business days.

## Step 7. Get a partner status {#step-7}

If you meet the partner [requirements](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_partnership_requirements/), you will become a {{ yandex-cloud }} partner program member after you complete the above steps.
