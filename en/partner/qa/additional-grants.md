# Additional grants in the partner program

#### What is the purpose of additional grants? {#additional-grants}

The program is aimed at helping partners activate their business of providing services to customers in {{ yandex-cloud }}. Therefore, we track our partners' objectives using grants. Within the first six months of obtaining partner status, you can receive two types of temporary grants under the program:

* A grant for testing replicated solutions.
* A grant for your customer's pilot.

#### What is the grant for testing replicated solutions? {#test-grant}

This grant is given for solutions that a partner plans to regularly deploy in {{ yandex-cloud }} for their customers. The grant for testing replicated solutions can only be credited to the partner's account.

{% note warning %}

You can't transfer the grant amount to your customers' sub-accounts. You can only use it in your partner account's clouds. If you deploy a project for a customer in your partner account's cloud, you won't receive a partner bonus for consumption in that cloud. A bonus for consumption can be credited after this cloud is transferred to the customer's sub-account.

#### How do I get a grant for testing replicated solutions? {#get-test-grant}

Send a request to the support service with the following information:

* A description of the solution you want to implement.
* Deadlines for its implementation and testing with a reasonable explanation.
* The way you plan to replicate the solution to your customers.
* A list of services you need.
* The requested grant amount in rubles.
* Your partner account.

The support service will review your request and notify you of its decision about giving the grant and its terms and conditions (amount, validity period, and crediting period).

#### What is the grant for your customer's pilot? {#pilot-grant}

The grant for a pilot is credited to a customer's sub-account.

{% note info %}

A sub-account is an additional account for a customer's billing account. It's created automatically when you link your customer's account to your partner account in the partner portal. It's displayed both in your {{ yandex-cloud }} account's console and the customer's console.
