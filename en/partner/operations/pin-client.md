# Pinning a customer in the partner portal

To add and pin a customer, you should switch to paid consumption mode.

{% note info %}

If you haven't spent the initial grant yet, it remains after switching to the paid version. Your personal account in {{ yandex-cloud }} won't be debited after you switch to paid consumption mode until you spend the entire amount of the initial grant.

{% endnote %}

## Creating a customer record {#create}

To add a new customer, create their record in the partner portal.

{% list tabs %}

- Partner portal

    To create a customer record:
    1. Log in to the [partner portal](https://partners.cloud.yandex.ru/) with the Yandex ID that the partner's account in {{ yandex-cloud }} is linked to. If you don't have access to it, this means that the account you use to log in has no partner status assigned.
    1. On the **Customers** tab, click **Add customer**.
    1. In the **New customer** form, fill in the fields with your customer's data.
    1. Click **Add**. This adds a new customer record to the list of customers in the partner portal.

    Once created, the customer record gets the `SUBACCOUNT-ACCEPTANCE-REQUIRED` status.

{% endlist %}

## Confirming partnership {#apply}

Customers with the `SUBACCOUNT-ACCEPTANCE-REQUIRED` status must confirm that they are ready to work with a partner. This happens in several stages:

1. An email with the <q>Confirm your willingness to work with the integrator in {{ yandex-cloud }}</q> subject is automatically sent to the customer's `@yandex.ru` email address that the {{ yandex-cloud }} account is registered to.

1. Once the customer confirms their willingness to work with the partner via this email, the customer's status in the partner portal changes to `Active`.

{% note warning %}

The email is only sent once!
If the customer doesn't follow the link provided in the email or can't find the email, the partner can, on its own, create a partnership confirmation link and pass it to the customer. To do this, replace `subaccount_ID` in the `https://partners.cloud.yandex.ru/invite/accept/subaccount_ID` link with a partner ID like `dn...`.
By clicking this link under their account, the customer confirms the partnership.

{% endnote %}

By default, when creating a customer record in the partner portal, a new empty cloud and a folder are created in the partner subaccount for the customer. The partner can see the ID of this cloud in the partner portal on the customer tab.

The customer can see their partner subaccount and the new cloud created in it on the management console's homepage and can start working with this cloud.

## Adding an existing cloud {#bing}

If the customer has previously used any {{ yandex-cloud }} resources and has an existing cloud, link this cloud to the partner subaccount.

{% note alert %}

If you don't link the customer's cloud, the customer will pay for this cloud separately in {{ yandex-cloud }}, and it won't be linked to the partner.

{% endnote %}

You can link the customer's cloud to the partner subaccount from the partner or customer's console.

For the partner to be able to link existing customer clouds, make sure the partner is granted access to them. Learn more about setting up access to a customer's cloud [here](access/grant.md).

{% list tabs %}

- Customer console

    To link a cloud on the customer's side:
    1. Open the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) homepage.
    1. Click the ![image](../../_assets/options.svg) icon in the partner's subaccount.
    1. Select **Link cloud**.
    1. In the drop-down list, select the cloud that you want to link.

    To prevent the partner from linking a customer's cloud on their own, revoke the roles for resources from the partner. Learn more about [roles in {{ yandex-cloud }}](../../resource-manager/security/).

- Partner console

    On the partner's side, a customer's cloud can be linked from the partner's management console homepage in the same way as described on the **Customer console** tab or through the customer's billing account.

    To link a cloud using the customer billing account:
    1. In the management console, go to the **Billing** tab, select the customer's account, and click on it.
    1. In the window that opens, click **Link cloud**.
    1. Select the cloud you need from the drop-down list. The desired cloud may not be on the list if:
       * Too little time has passed since the role was assigned to the partner in the customer console.
       * You need to change the role for this cloud.
