# VAR program

The _VAR (Value Added Reseller) program_ is a partnership program where a partner company resells {{ yandex-cloud }} services and earns a partner bonus.

A _partner bonus_ is a [discount](#premium) on {{ yandex-cloud }} services and technical support. The discount amount depends on the monthly (calendar) amount of services that the partner's customers used in total. When calculating the amount of services consumed, the cost of {{ marketplace-name }} resources and the partner's own consumption of services are not included.

Partners have to pay for the consumption of services by their customers. Under the VAR program, {{ yandex-cloud }} invoices a partner for the total consumption of services by all of its customers. Partners can settle payment invoices in advance (advance payment) or based on the results of consumption (postpaid model). They can also use a [billing threshold](../../billing/concepts/billing-threshold.md).

Program participants:
* A partner is a business that is a resident of the Russian Federation and provides services using {{ yandex-cloud }} technologies.
* A client is a business that purchases {{ yandex-cloud }} services from a partner (a partner subaccount).


## Bonus for participating in the program {#premium}

A partner bonus is a discount on {{ yandex-cloud }} services applied to the payment invoice issued to the {{ yandex-cloud }} partner's billing account at the end of month. The certificate, payment invoice, and regular invoice issued to the partner show the total amount for all services consumed by all partner's customers, including the discount.

### Discount amount {#discount}

The discount amount depends on the total monthly consumption of {{ yandex-cloud }} services by all sub-accounts (customers) linked to the partner's billing account. For more information, see the [Partner Agreement](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_grant/?lang=en).

### What is not included when calculating a partner bonus {#ignore}

The discount doesn't apply to:
* The partner's own consumption of services in the partner account.
* Grants credited to sub-accounts.
* Microsoft resources from {{ marketplace-name }}.

You can view the absolute and relative discounts for a billing period under **Rewards** on the [partner portal]({{ link-cloud-partners }}).

## How to leave the program {#end}

To withdraw from the program, a partner must send written notice to [technical support]({{ link-console-support }}) at least thirty calendar days in advance of the expected withdrawal date.

### Why can partner status be revoked {#recall}

{{ yandex-cloud }} reserves the right to unilaterally revoke partner status for non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the partner agreement.
