# Referral program

A _referral program_ is a program for attracting new {{ yandex-cloud }} customers by distributing referral links. The links are unique and allow for partner identification. The partner who attracted a customer receives a percentage of the amount that the customer pays for resource consumption.

Program participants:
* Referrer: A partner company that refers customers to {{ yandex-cloud }}. This can only be a business that is a resident of the Russian Federation.
* Referral: An attracted customer. This can be either a business or an individual.

## How to participate in the program {#desc}

To become a referrer, make sure your billing account meets the following requirements:
* Billing account type: [Business account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types).
* You registered your business account for a business or individual entrepreneur that is a resident of the Russian Federation.
* The payment method selected in the business account is <q>Bank transfer</q>.
* The business account switched to paid consumption, but the initial grants can still be used.

To become a referrer:
1. [On the website](https://cloud.yandex.ru/partners/service), click **Become a partner**.
1. Fill out the form.
1. Once you get partner status, generate referral links in the [partner portal]({{ link-cloud-partners }}).

### Referrer account requirements {#referrer-conditions}

To get the status of referral partner, make sure your billing account meets the following conditions:
* Billing account type: [Business account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types).
* You registered your business account for a business or individual entrepreneur that is a resident of the Russian Federation.
* The payment method selected in the business account is <q>Bank transfer</q>.

## Reward for attracted referrals {#premium}

### Referral registration conditions {#condition}

The following users are considered under the referral program:
* New users.
   A user is considered new if they had not previously signed up for {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* Users who have been inactive for more than 32 days.
   A user is considered inactive if their account status was `SUSPENDED` and they didn't use any service resources for more than 32 days.

A referrer will get a reward, provided that a referral:
1. Follows the referral link and signs up for {{ yandex-cloud }}.

   Specifics of signup by referral link:
   * If the user closes the browser and then re-opens the same link, the signup is accepted. However, if the user opens the URL without using the referral link, the signup isn't accepted.
   * If the user leaves out some information during registration (a phone number or email address in Yandex ID), the signup will be accepted only after the user enters the missing information and resumes registration in {{ yandex-cloud }}.
   * If the user closes the tab and opens the console without using the referral link (for example, {{ link-console-main }}), the signup isn't accepted.

1. Gives their consent to share information about their consumption of resources with the referrer for 12 months.
   The referrer only sees the total resource consumption of the referral. This is necessary to ensure the transparency of crediting rewards.

The referrer and referral do not sign any additional agreements for providing {{ yandex-cloud }} services.

If the conditions above are not met, the customer is not considered a participant of the referral program. In this case, the partner doesn't receive a reward for this customer.

### Reward amount {#sum}

A reward amounts to 10% of the sales amount to referrals, including VAT, but no more than ₽100000 per customer per month. You can track the resource consumption of the referred customers you attracted in your profile in the [partner portal]({{ link-cloud-partners }}).

### Reward payment period per referral {#duration}

A reward for a referral is paid within 12 months of their signing up via the referrer's link.

### Crediting rewards {#pay-period}

A reward is given once a month when {{ yandex-cloud }} receives payment for resources consumed by a referral. If a customer didn't consume or didn't pay for {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, no reward is given.

### Ways to receive a reward {#money}

The minimum amount for reward withdrawal is ₽500. There are two ways to get your reward:
1. A reward is defined as 10% the sales amount to referrals, including VAT.
   If you apply the general tax system, the calculated reward will include VAT at the rate of 20%. You'll be given an invoice and a report with the VAT amount as a separate item so that you pay VAT to the budget.
   If you apply the simplified tax system, the reward isn't subject to VAT.
1. Transfer the reward amount to a [grant](../../billing/concepts/bonus-account.md) and use it to pay for {{ yandex-cloud }} services.

You can select how to get your reward in the [partner portal]({{ link-cloud-partners }}).
