# Getting started with {{ iot-name }}

In {{ iot-name }}, you can send messages and subscribe to them via [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/). You can subscribe your IoT devices to [topics](concepts/topic/index.md) of your device registry or message broker. The broker imposes fewer restrictions on the way messages are exchanged than the registry does.

Get started with a [device registry](quickstart.md) or a [broker](quickstart-broker.md). Read about the service components in [{#T}](concepts/index.md).
