- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. Create a broker:

      ```
      yc iot broker create --name my-broker
      ```

      {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

      Result:

      ```
      id: b91ki3851h**********
      folder_id: aoek49ghmk*********
      created_at: "2022-05-28T11:29:42.420Z"
      name: my-broker
      ```

   1. Make sure the broker was created:

      ```
      yc iot broker list
      ```

      Result:
      ```
      +----------------------+-------------+
      |          ID          |    NAME     |
      +----------------------+-------------+
      | b91ki3851h********** |  my-broker  |
      +----------------------+-------------+
      ```

- {{ TF }}

   {% include [terraform-definition](../../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}

   If you do not have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   {% note info %}

   To add certificates to a broker, [generate](../certificates/create-certificates.md) them in advance.

   {% endnote %}

   To create a broker:

   1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of the resource to create:

      * `yandex_iot_core_broker`: Broker parameters:
         * `name`: Broker name.
         * `description`: Broker description.
         * `labels`: Broker labels in `key:value` format.
         * `certificates`: List of broker certificates for authorization using [certificates](../../concepts/authorization.md#certs).

      Sample resource structure in the configuration file:

      ```
      resource "yandex_iot_core_broker" "my_broker" {
        name        = "test-broker"
        description = "test broker for terraform provider documentation"
        labels = {
          test-label = "label-test"
        }

        certificates = [
          file("<path_to_first_file_with_certificate>"),
          file("<path_to_second_file_with_certificate>")
        ]
      }

      output "yandex_iot_core_broker_my_broker" {
        value = "${yandex_iot_core_broker.my_broker.id}"
      }
      ```

      For more information about resources you can create using {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/iot_core_broker).

   1. Make sure the configuration files are valid.
      1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run the check using this command:

         ```
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal will display a list of created resources and their parameters. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Deploy cloud resources.

      1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

         ```
         terraform apply
         ```

      1. Confirm that you want to create the resources.

         Once you are done, all the resources you need will be created in the specified folder. You can verify that the resources are there and properly configured in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or using the following [CLI](../../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

         ```bash
         yc iot broker list
         ```

- API

   You can create a broker using the API [create](../../broker/api-ref/Broker/create.md) method.
