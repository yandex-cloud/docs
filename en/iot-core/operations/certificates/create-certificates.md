# Creating a certificate

For devices to interact, you need X.509 certificates. If don't have one, you can create a certificate, for example, with [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org):

```
$ openssl req -x509 \
-newkey rsa:4096 \
-keyout key.pem \
-out cert.pem \
-nodes \
-days 365 \
-subj '/CN=localhost'
```

Where:

- `-x509`: X.509 certificate.
- `newkey`: Encryption algorithm.
- `-keyout`: File to write the private key to.
- `-out`: File to save the certificate to.
- `-nodes`: This flag is set when no public key encryption is required.
- `-days`: Certificate validity period in days.
- `-subj`: Request object.
