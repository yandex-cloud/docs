## What goes into the cost of using {{ alb-name }} {#rules}

When using the {{ alb-name }} service, you pay for the actual use of computing resources of every active load balancer.

The amount of used resources is determined by the number of [resource units](concepts/application-load-balancer.md#lcu-scaling), i.e., internal VMs provisioned for the load balancer in each availability zone.

{% include [lcu-thresholds](../_includes/application-load-balancer/lcu-thresholds.md) %}

You can limit the number of load balancer resource units in its [autoscaling settings](concepts/application-load-balancer.md#lcu-scaling-settings). By default, each availability zone requires at least two units, while the total number of units across all zones is unlimited. You cannot set a limit lower than two resource units per zone.

The load balancer usage is billed hourly. You are charged for the maximum number of resource units that were running for an hour. When [creating](operations/application-load-balancer-create.md) an L7 load balancer, you can see its cost calculation in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) on the right.

### Cost calculation example {#example}

A load balancer operates within a single availability zone. We use the default auto-scaling settings with the minimum of two resource units per zone and no limit on the maximum total number of units.

The load balancer has been running for an hour. The inbound traffic reached these peak values at various timestamps:

{% include [lcu-example](../_includes/application-load-balancer/lcu-example.md) %}

This workload requires **eight resource units** to process:

Calculating cost per hour:

30-day cost estimate for this hourly workload:
