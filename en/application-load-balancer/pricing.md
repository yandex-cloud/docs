### Example of cost calculation {#example}

A load balancer located in one availability zone, ran for an hour with the following indicators:

{% include [lcu-example](../_includes/application-load-balancer/lcu-example.md) %}

Calculating the number of resource units:
> Maximum (6000 / 1000, 30000 / 4000, 500 / 200, 20 / 22, 2) = maximum (6, 8, 3, 1, 2) = 8
>
> Total: 8 resource units.

Where:
* 6000 / 1000 = 6 is the number of resource units that contain 6000 RPS.
* 30000 / 4000 = 7.5 ~ 8 is the number of resource units that contain 30000 active connections.
* 500 / 200 = 2.5 ~ 3 is the number of resource units that contain 500 new connections.
* 20 / 22 = 0.9090... ~ 1 is the number of resource units that contain 20 MB of traffic per second.
* 2 is the minimum number of resource units in the zone.

Calculating the cost per hour:
> 
> 
> 8 × $0.017760 = $0.142080
>
> Total: $0.142080 is the cost of using a load balancer per hour.

Where:
* 8 is the number of resource units.
* $0.017760 is the cost per resource unit.

Calculating the cost per month (30 days) with the same hourly load:
> 
> 
> $0.142080 × 720 = $102.297600
>
> Total: $102.297600 is the cost of using the load balancer per month.

Where:
* $0.142080 is the cost per resource unit.
* 720 is the number of hours in a month.
