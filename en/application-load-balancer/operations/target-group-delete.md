# Delete a target group

To delete a target group:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the target group was created.
   1. Select **{{ alb-name }}**.
   1. On the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/trgroups.svg) **Target groups**.
   1. Select the target group and click ![image](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg).
   1. In the menu that opens, select **Delete**.

      To do this with multiple groups, select the groups to delete from the list and click **Delete** at the bottom of the screen.

   1. Confirm the deletion.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. See the description of the CLI's delete target group command:
      ```
      yc alb target-group delete --help
      ```

   1. Run the command:
      ```
      yc alb target-group delete <target group name or ID>
      ```

      To check the deletion, get a list of target groups by running the command:
      ```
      yc alb target-group list
      ```

- {{ TF }}

   {% include [terraform-definition](../../_tutorials/terraform-definition.md) %}

   For more information about {{ TF }}, [see the documentation](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and delete the fragment with the target group description.

      Sample target group description in the {{ TF }} configuration:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_alb_target_group" "foo" {
        name           = "<target group name>"
      
        target {
          subnet_id    = "<subnet ID>"
          ip_address   = "<internal IP address of VM 1>"
        }
      
        target {
          subnet_id    = "<subnet ID>"
          ip_address   = "<internal IP address of VM 2>"
        }
      
        target {
          subnet_id    = "<subnet ID>"
          ip_address   = "<internal IP address of VM 3>"
        }
      }
      ```

      For more information about the `yandex_alb_target_group` resource parameters, see the [{{ TF }} provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-alb-targetgroup }}).
   1. Apply the changes:

      {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../_tutorials/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

      You can verify that the target group has been updated in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or using the following [CLI](../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

      ```bash
      yc alb target-group list
      ```

{% endlist %}
