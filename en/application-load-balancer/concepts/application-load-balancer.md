# Load balancers

A load balancer is used for receiving incoming traffic and transmitting it to the backend endpoints. Requests are routed based on the settings of load balancer [listeners](#listener). Settings for transmitting traffic to backends are configured in [backend groups](backend-group.md).

The load balancer stores a list of endpoints, which accept traffic and disables TLS encryption before sending the traffic to backends. Load balancer supports modern TLS versions (TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3) and encryption methods. If the load balancer is going to serve multiple domains, you can configure individual certificates and [HTTP routers](http-router.md) for each domain by using the TLS SNI mechanism.

For convenience and security, you can use the load balancer together with {{ certificate-manager-full-name }} to store your TLS certificates. You can also use {{ monitoring-full-name }} services to monitor request processing.

## Security groups {#security-groups}

{% include [security-groups-note](../_includes_service/security-groups-note.md) %}

When you create a load balancer, specify [security groups](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) as they contain a set of rules for the load balancer to receive incoming traffic and send it to backend VMs. Security groups are also assigned to each VM.

For the load balancer to work correctly:

* The load balancer's security groups must allow:
   * Receiving external incoming traffic on the ports specified in the [listener](#listener). For example, for HTTP(S) traffic: TCP connections on ports `80` and `443` from any address (CIDR: `0.0.0.0/0`).
   * Receiving incoming traffic to check the health of the load balancer's nodes in different [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md): TCP connections on port `30080` from IP addresses in the `198.18.235.0/24` and `198.18.248.0/24` ranges.
   * Sending traffic to backend VMs. For example, any outgoing connections to internal addresses of VMs (CIDR: `<VM's internal IP>/32`) and to the [subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) or security groups that host the VMs.
* Backend VM security groups must allow incoming traffic from the load balancer on the ports specified in the [backend groups](backend-group.md). For example, any incoming connections from subnets that [host the load balancer](#lb-location) or from one of its security groups.

## Host load balancer {#lb-location}

When creating a load balancer, specify a [network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md) and [subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) in [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md). Those are the subnets where the load balancer's nodes will be hosted. Application backends will receive traffic from the load balancer nodes in these subnets.

You can disable the load balancer in the selected availability zones. In this case, external traffic will no longer be sent to the load balancer nodes in these availability zones. However, the load balancer's nodes in other availability zones will continue delivering traffic to backends in the availability zones where the load balancer was disabled if permitted by the [locality aware routing](backend-group.md#locality) settings.

### Recommended subnet sizes {#subnets-sizes}


For {{ alb-name }} to provide load balancer availability as specified in the [service level agreement](https://yandex.com/legal/cloud_sla_apploadbalancer/), load balancer subnets must have a sufficient number of [internal IP addresses](../../vpc/concepts/address.md#internal-addresses) available. We recommend sizing the subnets to have at least two free IPs per [resource unit](../pricing.md) at peak load.


> For instance, a load balancer is located in two availability zones with each handling the following load during peak hours:
>
> {% include [lcu-example](../../_includes/application-load-balancer/lcu-example.md) %}
>
> This corresponds to 8 resource units (see the [calculation](../pricing.md#example)) in each availability zone. Therefore, we recommend having at least 8 x 2 = 16 available addresses in each subnet. A load balancer subnet should be at least /27.


## Listener {#listener}

The listener determines the ports, addresses, and protocols the load balancer will accept traffic on.

Request routing to [backend groups](backend-group.md) depends on the _listener type_:

* **HTTP**: The load balancer accepts HTTP or HTTPS requests and distributes them across backend groups based on the rules set in [HTTP routers](http-router.md), or redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS. Backend groups receiving traffic must have the **HTTP** or **gRPC** [type](backend-group.md#group-type).
* **Stream**: The load balancer accepts incoming traffic via unencrypted or encrypted TCP connections and routes it to **Stream** backend groups.

If encrypted traffic is accepted, the _main listener_ and optional _SNI listeners_ are set up for the load balancer. In each SNI listener, the domain name specified when establishing a TLS connection as [Server Name Indication](https://{{ lang }}.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) (SNI) is mapped to a TLS certificate and HTTP router (if the listener type is **HTTP**) or a backend group (if the listener type is **Stream**). The main listener is responsible for TLS connections with domain names that don't match any SNI listener.

{% note tip %}

Some browsers reuse TLS connections with the same IP address if a connection certificate contains the necessary domain name. In this case, no new SNI match is selected and traffic may be routed to an inappropriate HTTP router. Use different certificates in different SNI listeners and the main listener. To distribute traffic across the domain names of a single certificate, set up HTTP router virtual hosts.

{% endnote %}

One load balancer can serve both regular and encrypted traffic on different ports and have public and internal IP addresses on different listeners.

### Example {#listener-example}

The listener can accept HTTP traffic on port 80 and redirect traffic to HTTPS port 443. The listener gets an HTTP request from a client and returns a response with HTTP code 302. Further requests will be accepted at port 443 via HTTPS.

If an HTTPS listener is used, specify a [certificate](../../certificate-manager/concepts/imported-certificate.md) from {{ certificate-manager-name }} that will be used to terminate TLS connections.

## Statistics {#stats}

Load balancer statistics are automatically logged in the {{ monitoring-full-name }} metrics. The following metrics are available:

* **RPS**: Number of load balancer requests per second.
* **4XX**, **5XX**: Number of load balancer responses containing HTTP codes 4XX and 5XX and the [corresponding gRPC codes](../../api-design-guide/concepts/errors.md#error-list) per second.
* **Request size**: Total volume of load balancer requests per second.
* **Response size**: Total volume of load balancer responses per second.
* **Latency**: Response delay (the time between the balancer receiving the first byte of a request to sending the last byte of the response), 50th to 99th percentiles.

{{ alb-name }} has aggregate load balancer statistics available. In {{ monitoring-name }}, you can view statistics itemized by the resources associated with the load balancer (HTTP routers, virtual hosts, routes, and the like) as well as [create alerts](../../monitoring/operations/alert/create-alert.md).

For instructions on viewing statistics, see [{#T}](../operations/application-load-balancer-get-stats.md).


## Logging {#logging}

When creating a load balancer, a log group is created for it in {{ cloud-logs-full-name }}. This log group is used to write messages about incoming requests. You can view the logs in the management console. A complete list of parameters is shown in the [log reference](../logs-ref.md).

You can set up log processing using {{ sf-full-name }}. To do this, create a [trigger for {{ cloud-logs-name }}](../../functions/concepts/trigger/cloudlogs-trigger.md) with the log group ID and a [function](../../functions/concepts/function.md) to be called by the trigger, with the message processing logic.

{% note warning %}

Currently, you can get the ID of the load balancer's log group and [create a trigger](../../functions/operations/trigger/cloudlogs-trigger-create.md) with this ID through the {{ yandex-cloud }} [CLI](../../cli/) or API only.

{% endnote %}

For an example of log processing, see the [{#T}](../tutorials/logging.md) use case.
