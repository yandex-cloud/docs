# {{ alb-full-name }} overview

{{ alb-full-name }} (L7 load balancer, an application-level load balancer) is a service that balances the load between services and applications deployed in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

{{ alb-name }} runs at Layer 7 of the OSI model and transmits traffic over HTTP and HTTPS to the backends of your applications. The load is distributed based on the parameters of HTTP requests sent to the balancer, for example, based on the values of Host headers or the URI. {{ alb-name }} also lets you handle TCP traffic and decrypt it if it's TLS encrypted.

The L7 load balancer infrastructure facilitates development and operation of applications that use the microservice architecture. It establishes secure connections to clients and provides tools for flexible traffic distribution across backends and options to analyze processed requests.

Main components of the application load balancer:

* [Load balancer](application-load-balancer.md)
* [HTTP router](http-router.md)
* [Backend group](backend-group.md)
* [Target group](target-group.md)
