# Gateway resource fields

The `Gateway` resource defines the rules for receiving incoming traffic and selecting routes ([`HTTPRoute` resources](http-route.md)) for the traffic. The [{{ alb-name }} Gateway API](../tools/k8s-gateway-api/index.md) uses these rules to create a [load balancer](../concepts/application-load-balancer.md) with the required listeners and [HTTP routers](../concepts/http-router.md).

`Gateway` is designed for cluster operators. Application developers should use `HTTPRoute`.

`Gateway` is a {{ k8s }} resource specified by the [{{ k8s }} Gateway API project](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/). This reference describes the fields and the annotations of the resource that the {{ alb-name }} Gateway API interfaces with. For a complete reference on the resource, please see the [{{ k8s }} Gateway API documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2.Gateway).

## Gateway {#gateway}

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: <string>
  namespace: <string>
  annotations:
    gateway.alb.yc.io/security-groups: <string>
spec: <GatewaySpec>
```

Where:

* `apiVersion`: `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2`
* `kind`: `Gateway`
* `metadata` (`ObjectMeta`, required)

   Resource metadata.

   * `name` (`string`, required)

      Resource name. For more information about format, please see the [{{ k8s }} documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names).

      Does not match the balancer name in {{ alb-name }}.

   * `namespace` (`string`)

      [Namespace](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#namespace) the resource belongs to. The default value is `default`.

   * `annotations` (`map[string]string`, required)

      Resource annotation.

      * `gateway.alb.yc.io/security-groups` (`string`, required)

         {% include [security-groups-note](../_includes_service/security-groups-note.md) %}

         List of {{ vpc-name }} [security groups](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) for a load balancer. Group IDs are provided in a comma-separated list, such as:

         ```
         gateway.alb.yc.io/security-groups: b0c2kotoidcoh6haf8cu,e2lnhhdj9a0aqmr78d36,e9bud5itjnl8mkjj7td1
         ```

         For proper load balancer and Gateway API operation, the security groups must be configured as specified in [{#T}](../tools/k8s-ingress-controller/security-groups.md).

* `spec` (`GatewaySpec`, required)

   Resource specification. For more detail, please see [below](#spec).


## GatewaySpec {#spec}

```yaml
gatewayClassName: yc-df-class
listeners:
  - name: <string>
    hostname: <string>
    port: <int32>
    protocol: <string>
    tls:
      mode: <string>
      certificateRefs:
        - group: <string>
          kind: <string>
          name: <string>
          namespace: <string>
        - ...
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: <string>
        selector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: <string>
              operator: <string>
              values:
                - <string>
                - ...
          matchLabels:
            <string>: <string>
            ...
  - ...
addresses:
  - type: IPAddress
    value: <string>
  - ...
```

Where:

* `gatewayClassName`: `yc-df-class`
* `listeners` (`[]Listener`)

   Load balancer listeners.

   * `name` (`string`)

      Internal name of the listener.

      Only used for {{ k8s }} needs and doesn't match the listener name in {{ alb-name }}.

      A name should have domain format corresponding to the following regular expression:

      ```[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*```

      For instance, names like `example`, `example.com`, or `foo.example.com` are suitable, while `example.com/bar` and `-example.` are not.

      The maximum length of the name is 63 characters.

   * `hostname` (`string`)

      Domain name that the listener is enabled for.

      {% include [k8s-ingress-controller-hostnames-wildcard](../../_includes/application-load-balancer/k8s-ingress-controller-hostnames-wildcard.md) %}

      The listener is only linked to the routes ([HTTPRoute](http-route.md) resources) whose domain names (the `spec.hostnames` field) <q>overlap</q> with the domain name specified in this field.

   * `port` (`int32`)

      Port where the listener is listening for incoming traffic.

   * `protocol` (`string`)

      Protocol used by the listener to listen for incoming traffic: `HTTP` or `HTTPS`.

   * `tls` (`GatewayTlsConfig`)

      Configuration used by the listener to listen for incoming HTTPS traffic.

      * `mode` (`string`)

         Mode for terminating TLS connections.

         The only supported and default value is `Terminate`: connections are terminated using certificates from the `certificateRefs` field, and decrypted traffic is routed to backends. `Passthrough` mode (without connection termination) is not supported.

      * `certificateRefs` (`[]SecretObjectReference`)

         List of {{ k8s }} resources where TLS certificates are stored.

         Only used if the `protocol` field value is `HTTPS`. The list should then contain at least one certificate.

         The load balancer only uses the first certificate from the list while ignoring the other ones.

         You can add a certificate to a cluster as a secret (`Secret` resource) using the {{ managed-k8s-name }} management console or kubectl:

         ```
         kubectl create secret tls <secret_name> \
           -n <namespace_name> \
           --cert <path_to_certificate_file> \
           --key <path to_file_with_certificate_private_key>
         ```

         * `group` (`string`)

            Name of the {{ k8s }} API group that the resource with the certificate belongs to, such as `networking.k8s.io`.

            The default value is an empty line that indicates the root API group.

         * `kind` (`string`)

            Type of {{ k8s }} resource that stores the certificate.

            The default value is `Secret`.

         * `name` (`string`)

            Name of {{ k8s }} resource that stores the certificate.

         * `namespace` (`string`)

            Namespace that the name of the resource with the certificate belongs to.

   * `allowedRoutes` (`AllowedRoutes`)

      Rules for selecting routes for the listener (`HTTPRoute` resources). These routes are used for creating [HTTP routers](../concepts/http-router.md) and [backend groups](../concepts/backend-group.md) linked to the listener.

      To have the `HTTPRoute` selected, its [specification](http-route.md#spec) (the `spec.parentRefs` field) must refer to the `Gateway` resource.

      * `namespaces` (`RouteNamespaces`)

         Rule for selecting namespaces that the `HTTPRoute` resources linked to the listener belong to.

         * `from` (`string`)

            Rule type:

            * `All`: Resources from all namespaces are selected.
            * `Same`: Resources are only selected from the same namespace as that of the `Gateway` resource (the `metadata.namespace` field).
            * `Selector`: Resources are selected from namespaces that meet the requirements from the `selector` field.

         * `selector` (`LabelSelector`)

            A selector is a set of namespace requirements. Only namespaces that meet all the requirements from the `matchExpressions` and `matchLabels` fields are selected.

            For more information, see the [{{ k8s }} API reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#labelselector-v1-meta).

            If the `from` field value is different from `Selector`, the `selector` field is ignored.

* `addresses` (`[]GatewayAddress`)

   Load balancer's public IP settings.

   If omitted, the load balancer is automatically assigned one public IP address.

   * `type`: `IPAddress`
   * `value` (`string`)

      {{ vpc-full-name }} public IP assigned to the load balancer.

      Before specifying an IP address in this field, be sure to reserve it as described in the [instructions](../../vpc/operations/get-static-ip.md).
