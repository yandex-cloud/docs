# Creating a space

Before you get started, [make sure](../../../iam/operations/roles/get-assigned-roles.md) your account has the `speech-sense.spaces.creator` role that allows creating a [space](../../concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#space).

To create a space:

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Click **Create space**.
1. Enter a name for the space.
1. (Optional) Add a space description.
1. Click **Create**.

Once the space is created, [link a billing account to it](link-ba.md). It is required to [pay for resources](../../pricing.md) in the space.
