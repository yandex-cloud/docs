# Video API, gRPC: VideoService.List

Lists all videos in a specific channel with pagination support.
Results can be filtered and sorted using the provided parameters.

## gRPC request

**rpc List ([ListVideoRequest](#yandex.cloud.video.v1.ListVideoRequest)) returns ([ListVideoResponse](#yandex.cloud.video.v1.ListVideoResponse))**

## ListVideoRequest {#yandex.cloud.video.v1.ListVideoRequest}

```json
{
  "channel_id": "string",
  "page_size": "int64",
  "page_token": "string",
  "order_by": "string",
  "filter": "string"
}
```

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| channel_id | **string**

Required field. ID of the channel containing the videos to list. ||
|| page_size | **int64**

The maximum number of videos to return per page. ||
|| page_token | **string**

Page token for retrieving the next page of results.
This token is obtained from the next_page_token field in the previous ListVideoResponse. ||
|| order_by | **string**

Specifies the ordering of results.
Format is "&lt;field&gt; &lt;order&gt;" (e.g., "createdAt desc").
Default: "id asc".
Supported fields: ["id", "title", "createdAt", "updatedAt"].
Both snake_case and camelCase field names are supported. ||
|| filter | **string**

Filter expression to narrow down the list of returned videos.
Expressions consist of terms connected by logical operators.
Values containing spaces or quotes must be enclosed in quotes (`'` or `"`)
with inner quotes being backslash-escaped.

Supported logical operators: ["AND", "OR"].
Supported comparison operators: ["=", "!=", ":"] where ":" enables substring matching.
Parentheses can be used to group logical expressions.

Example: `title:'sample' AND (status='READY' OR visibilityStatus='PUBLISHED')`

Filterable fields: ["id", "title", "status", "visibilityStatus"].
Both snake_case and camelCase field names are supported. ||
