# Monitoring resource usage during the trial period

{% include [grant-amount](../_includes/grant-amount.md) %}

You can use the grant to pay for {{ yandex-cloud }} services. [The grant terms of use](usage-grant.md) differ for individual and business accounts.

During the trial period, you can [view statistics](../../billing/operations/check-charges.md) on resource usage and charges based on the usage rates. The reports are available in the management console on the [**Billing**]({{ link-console-billing }}) page.

You can also use the management console to find out how much of the grant is still available and how many days are left until the trial period expires.
