The cost of support under the service plan is fixed at {{ sku|USD|support.business.fixed_consumption.v1|string }} per month plus an additional amount, which is calculated as a percent of the cost of resources consumed for the current month, if such cost exceeds $769.23.

The consumption cost percentage is calculated as follows:

* If the consumption amount is more than $769.23 but less than $2564.1, the additional cost is 7% the difference of the consumption amount minus $769.23.
* If the consumption amount is more than $2564.1, the additional cost is $125.64 plus 5% the difference of the consumption amount minus $2564.10.
