#|
||Field | Description ||
|| id | **string**

ID of the operation. ||
|| description | **string**

Description of the operation. 0-256 characters long. ||
|| createdAt | **string** (date-time)

Creation timestamp.

String in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format. The range of possible values is from
`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` to `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z`, i.e. from 0 to 9 digits for fractions of a second.

To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the
[Protocol Buffers reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/overview).
In some languages, built-in datetime utilities do not support nanosecond precision (9 digits). ||
|| createdBy | **string**

ID of the user or service account who initiated the operation. ||
|| modifiedAt | **string** (date-time)

The time when the Operation resource was last modified.

|| done | **boolean**

If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. ||
|| metadata | **[PerformLineActionMetadata](#yandex.cloud.video.v1.PerformLineActionMetadata)**

Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.
It typically contains the ID of the target resource that the operation is performed on.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. ||
|| error | **[Status](#google.rpc.Status)**

The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||
|| response | **[StreamLine](#yandex.cloud.video.v1.StreamLine)**

The normal response of the operation in case of success.
If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete,
the response is [google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty).
If the original method is the standard Create/Update,
the response should be the target resource of the operation.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the response type, if any.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
