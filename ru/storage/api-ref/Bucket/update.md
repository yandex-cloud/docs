# Method update
Updates the specified bucket.
 
In most cases, `storage.editor` role (see [documentation](/docs/storage/security/#storage-editor)) should be enough
to update a bucket, subject to its [policy](/docs/storage/concepts/policy).
 
## HTTP request {#https-request}
```
PATCH https://storage.{{ api-host }}/storage/v1/buckets/{name}
```
 
## Path parameters {#path_params}
 
Parameter | Description
--- | ---
name | <p>Required. Name of the bucket to update.</p> <p>The name cannot be updated.</p> <p>To get the bucket name, make a <a href="/docs/storage/api-ref/Bucket/list">list</a> request.</p>
