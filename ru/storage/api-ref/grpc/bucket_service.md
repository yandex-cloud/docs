### ListBucketsRequest {#ListBucketsRequest}

Field | Description
--- | ---
folder_id | **string**<br>Required. ID of the folder to list buckets in. <br>To get the folder ID, make a [yandex.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.FolderService.List](/docs/resource-manager/api-ref/grpc/folder_service#List) request. The maximum string length in characters is 50.

anonymous_access_flags | **[AnonymousAccessFlags](#AnonymousAccessFlags)**<br>Flags for configuring public (anonymous) access to the bucket's content and settings. For details, see [documentation](/docs/storage/concepts/bucket#bucket-access).
