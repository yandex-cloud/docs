Field | Description
--- | ---
target_group_id | **string**<br>Required. ID of the target group to get operations for. <br>To get the target group ID, use a [TargetGroupService.List](#List) request. The maximum string length in characters is 50.
page_size | **int64**<br>The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `page_size`, the service returns a [ListTargetGroupOperationsResponse.next_page_token](#ListTargetGroupOperationsResponse) that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Default value: 100. The maximum value is 1000.
page_token | **string**<br>Page token. To get the next page of results, set `page_token` to the [ListTargetGroupOperationsResponse.next_page_token](#ListTargetGroupOperationsResponse) returned by a previous list request. The maximum string length in characters is 100.


### ListTargetGroupOperationsResponse {#ListTargetGroupOperationsResponse}

Field | Description
--- | ---
operations[] | **[operation.Operation](#Operation5)**<br>List of operations for the specified target group. 
next_page_token | **string**<br>Token for getting the next page of the list. If the number of results is greater than the specified [ListTargetGroupOperationsRequest.page_size](#ListTargetGroupOperationsRequest), use `next_page_token` as the value for the [ListTargetGroupOperationsRequest.page_token](#ListTargetGroupOperationsRequest) parameter in the next list request. <br>Each subsequent page will have its own `next_page_token` to continue paging through the results. 


### Operation {#Operation5}

Field | Description
--- | ---
id | **string**<br>ID of the operation. 
description | **string**<br>Description of the operation. 0-256 characters long. 
created_at | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**<br>Creation timestamp. 
created_by | **string**<br>ID of the user or service account who initiated the operation. 
modified_at | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**<br>The time when the Operation resource was last modified. 
done | **bool**<br>If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. 
metadata | **[google.protobuf.Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any)**<br>Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains the ID of the target resource that the operation is performed on. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. 
result | **oneof:** `error` or `response`<br>The operation result. If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set. If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set. If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set.
&nbsp;&nbsp;error | **[google.rpc.Status](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/reference/rpc/google.rpc#status)**<br>The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;response | **[google.protobuf.Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any)**<br>The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete, the response is [google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty). If the original method is the standard Create/Update, the response should be the target resource of the operation. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the response type, if any.
