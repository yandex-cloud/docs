# Application Load Balancer API, gRPC: VirtualHostService

A set of methods for managing virtual hosts of HTTP routers.

| Call | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Get](#Get) | Returns the specified virtual host. |
| [List](#List) | Lists virtual hosts of the specified HTTP router. |
| [Create](#Create) | Creates a virtual host in the specified HTTP router. |
| [Update](#Update) | Updates the specified virtual host of the specified HTTP router. |
| [Delete](#Delete) | Deletes the specified virtual host. |
| [RemoveRoute](#RemoveRoute) | Deletes the specified route from the specified virtual host. |
| [UpdateRoute](#UpdateRoute) | Updates the specified route of the specified virtual host. |

## Calls VirtualHostService {#calls}

## Get {#Get}

Returns the specified virtual host. <br>To get the list of all virtual hosts of an HTTP router, make a [List](#List) request.

**rpc Get ([GetVirtualHostRequest](#GetVirtualHostRequest)) returns ([VirtualHost](#VirtualHost))**

### GetVirtualHostRequest {#GetVirtualHostRequest}

Field | Description
--- | ---
http_router_id | **string**<br>Required. ID of the HTTP router that the virtual host belongs to. <br>To get the HTTP router ID, make a [HttpRouterService.List](./http_router_service#List) request. 
virtual_host_name | **string**<br>Required. Name of the virtual host to return. <br>To get the virtual host name, make a [VirtualHostService.List](#List) request. Value must match the regular expression ` ([a-z]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)? `.


### VirtualHost {#VirtualHost}

Field | Description
--- | ---
name | **string**<br>Required. Name of the virtual host. The name is unique within the HTTP router. 
authority[] | **string**<br>List of domains that are attributed to the virtual host. <br>The host is selected to process the request received by the load balancer if the domain specified in the HTTP/1.1 `Host` header or the HTTP/2 `:authority` pseudo-header matches a domain specified in the host. <br>A wildcard asterisk character (`*`) matches 0 or more characters. <br>If not specified, all domains are attributed to the host, which is the same as specifying a `*` value. An HTTP router must not contain more than one virtual host to which all domains are attributed. 
routes[] | **[Route](#Route)**<br>Routes of the virtual host. <br>A route contains a set of conditions (predicates) that are used by the load balancer to select the route for the request and an action on the request. For details about the concept, see [documentation](/docs/application-load-balancer/concepts/http-router#routes). <br>The order of routes matters: the first route whose predicate matches the request is selected. The most specific routes should be at the top of the list, so that they are not overridden. For example, if the first HTTP route is configured, via [HttpRoute.match](#HttpRoute), to match paths prefixed with just `/`, other routes are never matched. 
modify_request_headers[] | **[HeaderModification](#HeaderModification)**<br>Deprecated, use route_options.modify_request_headers. 
modify_response_headers[] | **[HeaderModification](#HeaderModification)**<br>Deprecated, use route_options.modify_response_headers. 
route_options | **[RouteOptions](#RouteOptions)**<br>
