              **enum** (Code)
              GRPC codes that should be discarded
              - `OK`: Not an error; returned on success
                HTTP Mapping: 200 OK
              - `CANCELLED`: The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller.
                HTTP Mapping: 499 Client Closed Request
              - `UNKNOWN`: Unknown error.  For example, this error may be returned when
              a `Status` value received from another address space belongs to
              an error space that is not known in this address space.  Also
              errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information
              may be converted to this error.
                HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
              - `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: The client specified an invalid argument.  Note that this differs
              from `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.  `INVALID_ARGUMENT` indicates arguments
              that are problematic regardless of the state of the system
              (e.g., a malformed file name).
                HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
              - `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations
              that change the state of the system, this error may be returned
              even if the operation has completed successfully.  For example, a
              successful response from a server could have been delayed long
              enough for the deadline to expire.
                HTTP Mapping: 504 Gateway Timeout
              - `NOT_FOUND`: Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found.
                Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class
              of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented whitelist,
              `NOT_FOUND` may be used. If a request is denied for some users within
              a class of users, such as user-based access control, `PERMISSION_DENIED`
              must be used.
                HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found
              - `ALREADY_EXISTS`: The entity that a client attempted to create (e.g., file or directory)
              already exists.
                HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
              - `PERMISSION_DENIED`: The caller does not have permission to execute the specified
              operation. `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used for rejections
              caused by exhausting some resource (use `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
              instead for those errors). `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be
              used if the caller can not be identified (use `UNAUTHENTICATED`
              instead for those errors). This error code does not imply the
              request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies
              other pre-conditions.
                HTTP Mapping: 403 Forbidden
              - `UNAUTHENTICATED`: The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the
              operation.
                HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized
              - `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`: Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or
              perhaps the entire file system is out of space.
                HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests
              - `FAILED_PRECONDITION`: The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
              required for the operation's execution.  For example, the directory
              to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to
              a non-directory, etc.
                Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide
              between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`:
              (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call.
              (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level
              (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the
              client should restart a read-modify-write sequence).
              (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until
              the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
              fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
              should be returned since the client should not retry unless
              the files are deleted from the directory.
                HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
              - `ABORTED`: The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as
              a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.
                See the guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
              `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.
                HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
              - `OUT_OF_RANGE`: The operation was attempted past the valid range.  E.g., seeking or
              reading past end-of-file.
                Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem that may
              be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
              system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an
              offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
              `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current
              file size.
                There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and
              `OUT_OF_RANGE`.  We recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific
              error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
              a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when
              they are done.
                HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
              - `UNIMPLEMENTED`: The operation is not implemented or is not supported/enabled in this
              service.
                HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented
              - `INTERNAL`: Internal errors.  This means that some invariants expected by the
              underlying system have been broken.  This error code is reserved
              for serious errors.
                HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
              - `UNAVAILABLE`: The service is currently unavailable.  This is most likely a
              transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with
              a backoff.
                See the guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
              `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.
                HTTP Mapping: 503 Service Unavailable
              - `DATA_LOSS`: Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.

- `HTTP_5XX`
- `HTTP_ALL` ||
|| grpcCodes[] | **enum** (Code)

GRPC codes that should be discarded

- `OK`: Not an error; returned on success

  HTTP Mapping: 200 OK
- `CANCELLED`: The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller.

  HTTP Mapping: 499 Client Closed Request
- `UNKNOWN`: Unknown error.  For example, this error may be returned when
a `Status` value received from another address space belongs to
an error space that is not known in this address space.  Also
errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information
may be converted to this error.

  HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
- `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: The client specified an invalid argument.  Note that this differs
from `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.  `INVALID_ARGUMENT` indicates arguments
that are problematic regardless of the state of the system
(e.g., a malformed file name).

  HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
- `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations
that change the state of the system, this error may be returned
even if the operation has completed successfully.  For example, a
successful response from a server could have been delayed long
enough for the deadline to expire.

  HTTP Mapping: 504 Gateway Timeout
- `NOT_FOUND`: Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found.

  Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class
of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented whitelist,
`NOT_FOUND` may be used. If a request is denied for some users within
a class of users, such as user-based access control, `PERMISSION_DENIED`
must be used.

  HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found
- `ALREADY_EXISTS`: The entity that a client attempted to create (e.g., file or directory)
already exists.

  HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: The caller does not have permission to execute the specified
operation. `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used for rejections
caused by exhausting some resource (use `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
instead for those errors). `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be
used if the caller can not be identified (use `UNAUTHENTICATED`
instead for those errors). This error code does not imply the
request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies
other pre-conditions.

  HTTP Mapping: 403 Forbidden
- `UNAUTHENTICATED`: The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the
operation.

  HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized
- `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`: Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or
perhaps the entire file system is out of space.

  HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests
- `FAILED_PRECONDITION`: The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
required for the operation's execution.  For example, the directory
to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to
a non-directory, etc.

  Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide
between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`:
(a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call.
(b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level
(e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the
client should restart a read-modify-write sequence).
(c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until
the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
should be returned since the client should not retry unless
the files are deleted from the directory.

  HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
- `ABORTED`: The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as
a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.

  See the guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
`ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.

  HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
- `OUT_OF_RANGE`: The operation was attempted past the valid range.  E.g., seeking or
reading past end-of-file.

  Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem that may
be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an
offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
`OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current
file size.

  There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and
`OUT_OF_RANGE`.  We recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific
error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when
they are done.

  HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
- `UNIMPLEMENTED`: The operation is not implemented or is not supported/enabled in this
service.

  HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented
- `INTERNAL`: Internal errors.  This means that some invariants expected by the
underlying system have been broken.  This error code is reserved
for serious errors.

  HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
- `UNAVAILABLE`: The service is currently unavailable.  This is most likely a
transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with
a backoff.

  See the guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
`ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.

  HTTP Mapping: 503 Service Unavailable
- `DATA_LOSS`: Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.

  HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error ||
|| discardPercent | **string** (int64)

Percent of logs to be discarded: 0 - keep all, 100 or unset - discard all ||

|| grpcCodes[] | **enum** (Code)

GRPC codes that should be discarded

- `OK`: Not an error; returned on success

  HTTP Mapping: 200 OK
- `CANCELLED`: The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller.

  HTTP Mapping: 499 Client Closed Request
- `UNKNOWN`: Unknown error.  For example, this error may be returned when
a `Status` value received from another address space belongs to
an error space that is not known in this address space.  Also
errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information
may be converted to this error.

  HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
- `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: The client specified an invalid argument.  Note that this differs
from `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.  `INVALID_ARGUMENT` indicates arguments
that are problematic regardless of the state of the system
(e.g., a malformed file name).

  HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
- `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations
that change the state of the system, this error may be returned
even if the operation has completed successfully.  For example, a
successful response from a server could have been delayed long
enough for the deadline to expire.

  HTTP Mapping: 504 Gateway Timeout
- `NOT_FOUND`: Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found.

  Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class
of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented whitelist,
`NOT_FOUND` may be used. If a request is denied for some users within
a class of users, such as user-based access control, `PERMISSION_DENIED`
must be used.

  HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found
- `ALREADY_EXISTS`: The entity that a client attempted to create (e.g., file or directory)
already exists.

  HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: The caller does not have permission to execute the specified
operation. `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used for rejections
caused by exhausting some resource (use `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
instead for those errors). `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be
used if the caller can not be identified (use `UNAUTHENTICATED`
instead for those errors). This error code does not imply the
request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies
other pre-conditions.

  HTTP Mapping: 403 Forbidden
- `UNAUTHENTICATED`: The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the
operation.

  HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized
- `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`: Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or
perhaps the entire file system is out of space.

  HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests
- `FAILED_PRECONDITION`: The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
required for the operation's execution.  For example, the directory
to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to
a non-directory, etc.

  Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide
between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`:
(a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call.
(b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level
(e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the
client should restart a read-modify-write sequence).
(c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until
the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
should be returned since the client should not retry unless
the files are deleted from the directory.

  HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
- `ABORTED`: The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as
a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.

  See the guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
`ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.

  HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
- `OUT_OF_RANGE`: The operation was attempted past the valid range.  E.g., seeking or
reading past end-of-file.

  Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem that may
be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an
offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
`OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current
file size.

  There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and
`OUT_OF_RANGE`.  We recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific
error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when
they are done.

  HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
- `UNIMPLEMENTED`: The operation is not implemented or is not supported/enabled in this
service.

  HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented
- `INTERNAL`: Internal errors.  This means that some invariants expected by the
underlying system have been broken.  This error code is reserved
for serious errors.

  HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
- `UNAVAILABLE`: The service is currently unavailable.  This is most likely a
transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with
a backoff.

  See the guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
`ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.

  HTTP Mapping: 503 Service Unavailable
- `DATA_LOSS`: Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.

  HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error ||
|| discardPercent | **string** (int64)

Percent of logs to be discarded: 0 - keep all, 100 or unset - discard all ||
