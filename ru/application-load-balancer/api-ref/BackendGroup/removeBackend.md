An Operation resource. For more information, see [Operation](/docs/api-design-guide/concepts/operation).

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| id | **string**

ID of the operation. ||
|| description | **string**

Description of the operation. 0-256 characters long. ||
|| createdAt | **string** (date-time)

Creation timestamp.

String in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format. The range of possible values is from
`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` to `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z`, i.e. from 0 to 9 digits for fractions of a second.

To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the
[Protocol Buffers reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/overview).
In some languages, built-in datetime utilities do not support nanosecond precision (9 digits). ||
|| createdBy | **string**

ID of the user or service account who initiated the operation. ||
|| modifiedAt | **string** (date-time)

The time when the Operation resource was last modified.

String in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format. The range of possible values is from
`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` to `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z`, i.e. from 0 to 9 digits for fractions of a second.

To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the
[Protocol Buffers reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/overview).
In some languages, built-in datetime utilities do not support nanosecond precision (9 digits). ||
|| done | **boolean**

If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. ||
|| metadata | **[RemoveBackendMetadata](#yandex.cloud.apploadbalancer.v1.RemoveBackendMetadata)**

Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.
It typically contains the ID of the target resource that the operation is performed on.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. ||
|| error | **[Status](#google.rpc.Status)**

The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||
|| response | **[BackendGroup](#yandex.cloud.apploadbalancer.v1.BackendGroup)**

The normal response of the operation in case of success.
If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete,
the response is [google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty).
If the original method is the standard Create/Update,
the response should be the target resource of the operation.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the response type, if any.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| name | **string**

Required field. Name of the backend. ||
|| backendWeight | **string** (int64)

Backend weight. Traffic is distributed between backends of a backend group according to their weights.

Weights must be set either for all backends in a group or for none of them.
Setting no weights is the same as setting equal non-zero weights for all backends.

If the weight is non-positive, traffic is not sent to the backend. ||
|| loadBalancingConfig | **[LoadBalancingConfig](#yandex.cloud.apploadbalancer.v1.LoadBalancingConfig)**

Load balancing configuration for the backend. ||
|| port | **string** (int64)

For details about health checking, see [documentation](/docs/application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group#health-checks).

If no health checks are specified, active health checking is not performed. ||
|| tls | **[BackendTls](#yandex.cloud.apploadbalancer.v1.BackendTls)**

Settings for TLS connections between load balancer nodes and backend targets.

If specified, the load balancer establishes HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) connections with targets
and compares received certificates with the one specified in [BackendTls.validationContext](#yandex.cloud.apploadbalancer.v1.BackendTls).
If not specified, the load balancer establishes unencrypted HTTP connections with targets. ||
|| useHttp2 | **boolean**

Enables HTTP/2 usage in connections between load balancer nodes and backend targets.

Default value: `false`, HTTP/1.1 is used. ||
|#

## LoadBalancingConfig {#yandex.cloud.apploadbalancer.v1.LoadBalancingConfig}

A load balancing configuration resource.

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| panicThreshold | **string** (int64)

Threshold for panic mode.

If percentage of healthy backends in the group drops below threshold,
panic mode will be activated and traffic will be routed to all backends, regardless of their health check status.
This helps to avoid overloading healthy backends.
For details about panic mode, see [documentation](/docs/application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group#panic-mode).

If the value is `0`, panic mode will never be activated and traffic is routed only to healthy backends at all times.

Default value: `0`. ||
|| localityAwareRoutingPercent | **string** (int64)

Percentage of traffic that a load balancer node sends to healthy backends in its availability zone.
The rest is divided equally between other zones. For details about zone-aware routing, see
[documentation](/docs/application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group#locality).

If there are no healthy backends in an availability zone, all the traffic is divided between other zones.

If `strictLocality` is `true`, the specified value is ignored.
A load balancer node sends all the traffic within its availability zone, regardless of backends' health.

Default value: `0`. ||
|| strictLocality | **boolean**

Specifies whether a load balancer node should only send traffic to backends in its availability zone,
regardless of their health, and ignore backends in other zones.

If set to `true` and there are no healthy backends in the zone, the node in this zone will respond
to incoming traffic with errors.
For details about strict locality, see [documentation](/docs/application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group#locality).

If `strict_locality` is `true`, the value specified in `localityAwareRoutingPercent` is ignored.

Default value: `false`. ||
|| mode | **enum** (LoadBalancingMode)

Load balancing mode for the backend.

For details about load balancing modes, see
[documentation](/docs/application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group#balancing-mode).

- `ROUND_ROBIN`: Round robin load balancing mode.

  All endpoints of the backend take their turns to receive requests attributed to the backend.
- `RANDOM`: Random load balancing mode. Default value.

  For a request attributed to the backend, an endpoint that receives it is picked at random.
- `LEAST_REQUEST`: Least request load balancing mode.

  To pick an endpoint that receives a request attributed to the backend, the power of two choices algorithm is used;
that is, two endpoints are picked at random, and the request is sent to the one which has the fewest active
requests.
- `MAGLEV_HASH`: Maglev hashing load balancing mode.

  Each endpoint is hashed, and a hash table with 65537 rows is filled accordingly, so that every endpoint occupies
the same amount of rows. An attribute of each request is also hashed by the same function (if session affinity is
enabled for the backend group, the attribute to hash is specified in session affinity configuration). The row
with the same number as the resulting value is looked up in the table to determine the endpoint that receives
the request.

  If the backend group with session affinity enabled contains more than one backend with positive weight, endpoints
for backends with `MAGLEV_HASH` load balancing mode are picked at `RANDOM` instead. ||
