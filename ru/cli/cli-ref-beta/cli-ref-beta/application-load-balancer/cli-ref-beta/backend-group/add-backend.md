If there are no healthy backends in an availability zone, all the traffic is divided between other zones. If [strict_locality] is 'true', the specified value is ignored. A load balancer node sends all the traffic within its availability zone, regardless of backends' health. Default value: '0'.<br/>mode -> (enum<LEAST_REQUEST\|MAGLEV_HASH\|RANDOM\|ROUND_ROBIN>)<br/>Load balancing mode for the backend. For details about load balancing modes, see documentation.<br/>panic-threshold -> (int)<br/>Threshold for panic mode. If percentage of healthy backends in the group drops below threshold, panic mode will be activated and traffic will be routed to all backends, regardless of their health check status. This helps to avoid overloading healthy backends. For details about panic mode, see documentation. If the value is '0', panic mode will never be activated and traffic is routed only to healthy backends at all times. Default value: '0'.<br/>strict-locality -> (bool)<br/>Specifies whether a load balancer node should only send traffic to backends in its availability zone, regardless of their health, and ignore backends in other zones. If set to 'true' and there are no healthy backends in the zone, the node in this zone will respond to incoming traffic with errors. For details about strict locality, see documentation. If 'strict_locality' is 'true', the value specified in [locality_aware_routing_percent] is ignored. Default value: 'false'.<br/>name -> (string)<br/>Name of the backend.<br/>port -> (int)<br/>Port used by all targets to receive traffic.<br/>tls -> (struct)<br/>Settings for TLS connections between load balancer nodes and backend targets. If specified, the load balancer establishes TLS-encrypted TCP connections with targets and compares received certificates with the one specified in [BackendTls.validation_context]. If not specified, the load balancer establishes unencrypted TCP connections with targets.<br/>sni -> (string)<br/>Server Name Indication (SNI) string for TLS connections.<br/>validation-context -> (struct)<br/>Validation context for TLS connections.<br/>trusted-ca -> (oneof<trusted-ca-bytes\|trusted-ca-id>)<br/>Oneof trusted-ca field<br/>trusted-ca-id -> (string)<br/>trusted-ca-bytes -> (string)<br/>X.509 certificate contents in PEM format.<br/>backend-type -> (oneof\<target-groups\>)<br/>Oneof backend-type field<br/>target-groups -> (struct)<br/>Target groups that belong to the backend. For details about target groups, see documentation.<br/>target-group-ids -> ([]string)<br/>List of ID's of target groups that belong to the backend. To get the ID's of all available target groups, make a [TargetGroupService.List] request.|
