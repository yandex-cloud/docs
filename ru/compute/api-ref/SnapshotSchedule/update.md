# Compute Cloud API, REST: SnapshotSchedule.Update

Updates the specified snapshot schedule.

The schedule is updated only after all snapshot creations and deletions triggered by the schedule are completed.

## HTTP request

```
PATCH https://compute.{{ api-host }}/compute/v1/snapshotSchedules/{snapshotScheduleId}
```

## Path parameters

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| snapshotScheduleId | **string**

Required field. ID of the snapshot schedule to update.

To get the snapshot schedule ID, make a [SnapshotScheduleService.List](/docs/compute/api-ref/SnapshotSchedule/list#List) request. ||
|#

## Body parameters {#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.UpdateSnapshotScheduleRequest}

```json
{
  "updateMask": "object",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "labels": "object",
  "schedulePolicy": {
    "startAt": "string",
    "expression": "string"
  },
  // Includes only one of the fields `retentionPeriod`, `snapshotCount`
  "retentionPeriod": "string",
  "snapshotCount": "string",
  // end of the list of possible fields
  "snapshotSpec": {

  }
}
```

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| updateMask | **object** (field-mask)

A comma-separated names off ALL fields to be updated.
Only the specified fields will be changed. The others will be left untouched.
If the field is specified in `` updateMask `` and no value for that field was sent in the request,
the field's value will be reset to the default. The default value for most fields is null or 0.

If `` updateMask `` is not sent in the request, all fields' values will be updated.
Fields specified in the request will be updated to provided values.
The rest of the fields will be reset to the default. ||
|| name | **string**

New name for the snapshot schedule.

The name must be unique within the folder. ||
|| description | **string**

New description of the snapshot schedule. ||
|| labels | **object** (map<**string**, **string**>)

Snapshot schedule labels as `key:value` pairs.

Existing set of labels is completely replaced by the provided set, so if you just want
to add or remove a label:
1. Get the current set of labels with a [SnapshotScheduleService.Get](/docs/compute/api-ref/SnapshotSchedule/get#Get) request.
2. Add or remove a label in this set.
3. Send the new set in this field. ||
|| schedulePolicy | **[SchedulePolicy](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.SchedulePolicy)**

automatically deleted.

Includes only one of the fields `retentionPeriod`, `snapshotCount`.

New retention policy of the snapshot schedule. ||
|| snapshotCount | **string** (int64)

Retention count of the snapshot schedule. Once the number of snapshots created by the schedule exceeds this
number, the oldest ones are automatically deleted. E.g. if the number is 5, the first snapshot is deleted
after the sixth one is created, the second is deleted after the seventh one is created, and so on.

Includes only one of the fields `retentionPeriod`, `snapshotCount`.

New retention policy of the snapshot schedule. ||
|| snapshotSpec | **[SnapshotSpec](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.SnapshotSpec)**

To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the
[Protocol Buffers reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/overview).

|| expression | **string**

Cron expression for the snapshot schedule (UTC+0).

The expression must consist of five fields (`Minutes Hours Day-of-month Month Day-of-week`) or be one of
nonstandard predefined expressions (e.g. `@hourly`). For details about the format,
see [documentation](/docs/compute/concepts/snapshot-schedule#cron) ||
