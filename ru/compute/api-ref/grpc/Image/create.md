#|
||Field | Description ||
|| folder_id | **string**

Required field. ID of the folder to create an image in.
To get the folder ID, use a [yandex.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.FolderService.List](/docs/resource-manager/api-ref/grpc/Folder/list#List) request. ||
|| name | **string**

Name of the image. ||
|| description | **string**

Description of the image. ||
|| labels | **object** (map<**string**, **string**>)

Resource labels as `key:value` pairs. ||
|| family | **string**

The name of the image family to which this image belongs. For more information, see [Image family](/docs/compute/concepts/image#family).

To get an information about the most recent image from a family, use a [ImageService.GetLatestByFamily](/docs/compute/api-ref/grpc/Image/getLatestByFamily#GetLatestByFamily) request. ||
|| min_disk_size | **int64**

Minimum size of the disk that will be created from this image.
Specified in bytes. Should be more than the volume of source data. ||
|| product_ids[] | **string**

License IDs that indicate which licenses are attached to this resource.
License IDs are used to calculate additional charges for the use of the virtual machine.

The correct license ID is generated by the platform. IDs are inherited by new resources created from this resource.

If you know the license IDs, specify them when you create the image.
For example, if you create a disk image using a third-party utility and load it into Object Storage, the license IDs will be lost.
You can specify them in this request. ||
|| image_id | **string**

ID of the source image to create the new image from.

Includes only one of the fields `image_id`, `disk_id`, `snapshot_id`, `uri`. ||
|| disk_id | **string**

ID of the disk to create the image from.

Includes only one of the fields `image_id`, `disk_id`, `snapshot_id`, `uri`. ||
|| snapshot_id | **string**

ID of the snapshot to create the image from.

Includes only one of the fields `image_id`, `disk_id`, `snapshot_id`, `uri`. ||
|| uri | **string**

URI of the source image to create the new image from.
Currently only supports links to images that are stored in Object Storage.
Currently only supports Qcow2, VMDK, and RAW formats.

Includes only one of the fields `image_id`, `disk_id`, `snapshot_id`, `uri`. ||
|| os | **[Os](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.Os)**

Operating system that is contained in the image.

If not specified and you used the `image_id` or `disk_id` field to set the source, then the value can be inherited from the source resource. ||
|| pooled | **bool**

When true, an image pool will be created for fast creation disks from the image. ||
|| hardware_generation | **[HardwareGeneration](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.HardwareGeneration)**

Specify the overrides to hardware_generation of a source disk, image or snapshot,
or to the default values if the source does not define it. ||

|#

## HardwareGeneration {#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.HardwareGeneration}

They are not necessary supported by every host OS or distro, thus they are fixed to an image
and are applied to all instances created with it as their boot disk image.
These features significantly determine how the instance is created, thus cannot be changed after the fact.

Allows switching to PCI_TOPOLOGY_V2 and back.

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| pci_topology | enum **PCITopology**

- `PCI_TOPOLOGY_V1`
- `PCI_TOPOLOGY_V2` ||
|#

## Generation2HardwareFeatures {#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.Generation2HardwareFeatures}

and UEFI boot (with UEFI related features).

If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. ||
|| metadata | **[CreateImageMetadata](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.CreateImageMetadata)**
