| Call | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Get](#Get) | Returns the specified Snapshot resource. |
| [List](#List) | Retrieves the list of Snapshot resources in the specified folder. |
| [Create](#Create) | Creates a snapshot of the specified disk. |
| [Update](#Update) | Updates the specified snapshot. |
| [Delete](#Delete) | Deletes the specified snapshot. |
| [ListOperations](#ListOperations) | Lists operations for the specified snapshot. |

## Calls SnapshotService {#calls}

## Get {#Get}

Returns the specified Snapshot resource. <br>To get the list of available Snapshot resources, make a [List](#List) request.

**rpc Get ([GetSnapshotRequest](#GetSnapshotRequest)) returns ([Snapshot](#Snapshot))**

### GetSnapshotRequest {#GetSnapshotRequest}

Field | Description
--- | ---
snapshot_id | **string**<br>Required. ID of the Snapshot resource to return. To get the snapshot ID, use a [SnapshotService.List](#List) request. The maximum string length in characters is 50.


### Snapshot {#Snapshot}

Field | Description
--- | ---
id | **string**<br>ID of the snapshot. 
folder_id | **string**<br>ID of the folder that the snapshot belongs to. 
created_at | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**<br> 
name | **string**<br>Name of the snapshot. 1-63 characters long. 
description | **string**<br>Description of the snapshot. 0-256 characters long. 
labels | **map<string,string>**<br>Resource labels as `key:value` pairs. Maximum of 64 per resource.

disk_size | **int64**<br>Size of the disk when the snapshot was created, specified in bytes. 
product_ids[] | **string**<br>License IDs that indicate which licenses are attached to this resource. License IDs are used to calculate additional charges for the use of the virtual machine. <br>The correct license ID is generated by the platform. IDs are inherited by new resources created from this resource. <br>If you know the license IDs, specify them when you create the image. For example, if you create a disk image using a third-party utility and load it into Object Storage, the license IDs will be lost. You can specify them in the [yandex.cloud.compute.v1.ImageService.Create](/docs/compute/api-ref/grpc/image_service#Create) request.
