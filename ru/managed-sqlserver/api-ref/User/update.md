## Body parameters {#body_params}
 
```json 
{
  "updateMask": "string",
  "password": "string",
  "permissions": [
    {
      "databaseName": "string",
      "roles": [
        "string"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "serverRoles": [
    "string"
  ]
}
```

 
Field | Description
--- | ---
updateMask | **string**<br><p>Field mask that specifies which fields of the SQL Server user should be updated.</p> <p>A comma-separated names off ALL fields to be updated. Only the specified fields will be changed. The others will be left untouched. If the field is specified in ``updateMask`` and no value for that field was sent in the request, the field's value will be reset to the default. The default value for most fields is null or 0.</p> <p>If ``updateMask`` is not sent in the request, all fields' values will be updated. Fields specified in the request will be updated to provided values. The rest of the fields will be reset to the default.</p> 
password | **string**<br><p>New password for the user.</p> <p>The string length in characters must be 8-128.</p> 
permissions[] | **object**<br><p>New set of permissions for the user.</p> 
permissions[].<br>databaseName | **string**<br><p>Name of the database the permission grants access to.</p> 
permissions[].<br>roles[] | **string**<br><p>Required. Roles granted to the user within the database.</p> <p>The minimum number of elements is 1.</p> <ul> <li>DB_OWNER: Members of this fixed database role can perform all configuration and maintenance activities on a database and can also drop a database in SQL Server.</li> <li>DB_SECURITYADMIN: Members of this fixed database role can modify role membership for custom roles only and manage permissions. They can potentially elevate their privileges and their actions should be monitored.</li> <li>DB_ACCESSADMIN: Members of this fixed database role can add or remove access to a database for Windows logins, Windows groups, and SQL Server logins.</li> <li>DB_BACKUPOPERATOR: Members of this fixed database role can back up the database.</li> <li>DB_DDLADMIN: Members of this fixed database role can run any Data Definition Language (DDL) command in a database.</li> <li>DB_DATAWRITER: Members of this fixed database role can add, delete, or change data in all user tables.</li> <li>DB_DATAREADER: Members of this fixed database role can read all data from all user tables.</li> <li>DB_DENYDATAWRITER: Members of this fixed database role cannot add, modify, or delete any data in the user tables within a database. A denial has a higher priority than a grant, so you can use this role to quickly restrict one's privileges without explicitly revoking permissions or roles.</li> <li>DB_DENYDATAREADER: Members of this fixed database role cannot read any data in the user tables within a database. A denial has a higher priority than a grant, so you can use this role to quickly restrict one's privileges without explicitly revoking permissions or roles.</li> </ul> 
serverRoles[] | **string**<br><p>New set of server roles granted to the login.</p> <ul> <li> <p>MDB_MONITOR: Effectively grants VIEW SERVER STATE to the login.</p> <p>That gives an ability to use various dynamic management views to monitor server state, including Activity Monitor tool that is built-in into SSMS.</p> <p>No intrusive actions are allowed, so this is pretty safe to grant.</p> </li> </ul>

metadata | **object**<br><p>Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains the ID of the target resource that the operation is performed on. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.</p>

Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the response type, if any.</p>
