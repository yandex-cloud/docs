Acceptable values are 0 to 2, inclusive.
allow_ddl | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines whether DDL queries are allowed (e.g., **CREATE**, **ALTER**, **RENAME**, etc). <br>Default value: **true**. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/permissions-for-queries/#settings_allow_ddl). 
allow_introspection_functions | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables [introspections functions](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/introspection) for query profiling. <br>More info see in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-allow_introspection_functions). 
connect_timeout | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Connection timeout in milliseconds. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **10000**, 10 seconds). Value must be greater than 0.
connect_timeout_with_failover | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>The timeout in milliseconds for connecting to a remote server for a Distributed table engine. Applies only if the cluster uses sharding and replication. If unsuccessful, several attempts are made to connect to various replicas. <br>Default value: **50**. <br>More info see in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#connect-timeout-with-failover-ms). Value must be greater than 0.
receive_timeout | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Receive timeout in milliseconds. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **300000**, 300 seconds or 5 minutes). Value must be greater than 0.
send_timeout | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Send timeout in milliseconds. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **300000**, 300 seconds or 5 minutes). Value must be greater than 0.
timeout_before_checking_execution_speed | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Timeout (in seconds) between checks of execution speed. It is checked that execution speed is not less that specified in `min_execution_speed` parameter. <br>Default value: **10**. 
insert_quorum | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Enables or disables write quorum for ClickHouse cluster. If the value is less than **2**, then write quorum is disabled, otherwise it is enabled. <br>When used, write quorum guarantees that ClickHouse has written data to the quorum of **insert_quorum** replicas with no errors until the `insert_quorum_timeout` expires. All replicas in the quorum are in the consistent state, meaning that they contain linearized data from the previous **INSERT** queries. Employ write quorum, if you need the guarantees that the written data would not be lost in case of one or more replicas failure. <br>You can use `select_sequential_consistency` setting to read the data written with write quorum. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-insert_quorum). The minimum value is 0.
insert_quorum_timeout | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Quorum write timeout in milliseconds. <br>If the write quorum is enabled in the cluster, this timeout expires and some data is not written to the `insert_quorum` replicas, then ClickHouse will abort the execution of **INSERT** query and return an error. In this case, the client must send the query again to write the data block into the same or another replica. <br>Minimum value: **1000**, 1 second (default: **60000**, 1 minute). The minimum value is 1000.
insert_quorum_parallel | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-insert_quorum_parallel). 
insert_null_as_default | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables the insertion of default values instead of NULL into columns with not nullable data type. <br>Default value: **true**. <br>More info see in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#insert_null_as_default). 
select_sequential_consistency | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines the behavior of **SELECT** queries from the replicated table: if enabled, ClickHouse will terminate a query with error message in case the replica does not have a chunk written with the quorum and will not read the parts that have not yet been written with the quorum. <br>Default value: **false** (sequential consistency is disabled). 
deduplicate_blocks_in_dependent_materialized_views | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-deduplicate-blocks-in-dependent-materialized-views). 
replication_alter_partitions_sync | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Wait mode for asynchronous actions in **ALTER** queries on replicated tables: <br><ul><li>**0**-do not wait for replicas. </li><li>**1**-only wait for own execution (default). </li><li>**2**-wait for all replicas. </li></ul><br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/#synchronicity-of-alter-queries). Acceptable values are 0 to 2, inclusive.
max_replica_delay_for_distributed_queries | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Max replica delay in milliseconds. If a replica lags more than the set value, this replica is not used and becomes a stale one. <br>Minimum value: **1000**, 1 second (default: **300000**, 300 seconds or 5 minutes). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_replica_delay_for_distributed_queries). The minimum value is 1000.
fallback_to_stale_replicas_for_distributed_queries | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables query forcing to a stale replica in case the actual data is unavailable. If enabled, ClickHouse will choose the most up-to-date replica and force the query to use the data in this replica. This setting can be used when doing **SELECT** query from a distributed table that points to replicated tables. <br>Default value: **true** (query forcing is enabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-fallback_to_stale_replicas_for_distributed_queries). 
distributed_product_mode | enum **DistributedProductMode**<br>Determine the behavior of distributed subqueries. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#distributed-product-mode). <ul><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_DENY`: Default value. Prohibits using these types of subqueries (returns the "Double-distributed in/JOIN subqueries is denied" exception).</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_LOCAL`: Replaces the database and table in the subquery with local ones for the destination server (shard), leaving the normal IN/JOIN.</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_GLOBAL`: Replaces the IN/JOIN query with GLOBAL IN/GLOBAL JOIN.</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_ALLOW`: Allows the use of these types of subqueries.</li></ul>
distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables of disables memory saving mode when doing distributed aggregation. <br>When ClickHouse works with a distributed query, external aggregation is done on remote servers. Enable this setting to achieve a smaller memory footprint on the server that sourced such a distributed query. <br>Default value: **false** (memory saving mode is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/group-by/#select-group-by-in-external-memory). 
distributed_ddl_task_timeout | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Timeout for DDL queries, in milliseconds. 
skip_unavailable_shards | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables silent skipping of unavailable shards. <br>A shard is considered unavailable if all its replicas are also unavailable. <br>Default value: **false** (silent skipping is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-skip_unavailable_shards). 
compile_expressions | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables expression compilation. If you execute a lot of queries that contain identical expressions, then enable this setting. As a result, such queries may be executed faster due to use of compiled expressions. <br>Use this setting in combination with `min_count_to_compile_expression` setting. <br>Default value: **false** (expression compilation is disabled). 
min_count_to_compile_expression | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>How many identical expressions ClickHouse has to encounter before they are compiled. <br>Minimum value: **0** (default: **3**). <br>For the **0** value compilation is synchronous: a query waits for expression compilation process to complete prior to continuing execution. It is recommended to set this value only for testing purposes. <br>For all other values, compilation is asynchronous: the compilation process executes in a separate thread. When a compiled expression is ready, it will be used by ClickHouse for eligible queries, including the ones that are currently running. The minimum value is 0.
max_block_size | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>The maximum block size for reading. <br>Data in ClickHouse is organized and processed by blocks (block is a set of columns' parts). The internal processing cycles for a single block are efficient enough, but there are noticeable expenditures on each block. <br>This setting is a recommendation for size of block (in a count of rows) that should be loaded from tables. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **65536**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-max_block_size). Value must be greater than 0.
min_insert_block_size_rows | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of rows in a block to be inserted in a table by **INSERT** query. Blocks that are smaller than the specified value, will be squashed together into the bigger blocks. <br>Minimal value: **0**, block squashing is disabled (default: **1048576**). The minimum value is 0.
min_insert_block_size_bytes | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of bytes in a block to be inserted in a table by **INSERT** query. Blocks that are smaller than the specified value, will be squashed together into the bigger blocks. <br>Minimal value: **0**, block squashing is disabled (default: **268435456**, 256 MB). The minimum value is 0.
max_insert_block_size | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Allows to form blocks of the specified size (in bytes) when inserting data in a table. This setting has effect only if server is creating such blocks by itself. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **1048576**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_insert_block_size). Value must be greater than 0.
min_bytes_to_use_direct_io | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of bytes to enable unbuffered direct reads from disk (Direct I/O). <br>By default, ClickHouse does not read data directly from disk, but relies on the filesystem and its cache instead. Such reading strategy is effective when the data volume is small. If the amount of the data to read is huge, it is more effective to read directly from the disk, bypassing the filesystem cache. <br>If the total amount of the data to read is greater than the value of this setting, then ClickHouse will fetch this data directly from the disk. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, Direct I/O is disabled. The minimum value is 0.
use_uncompressed_cache | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines whether to use the cache of uncompressed blocks, or not. Using this cache can significantly reduce latency and increase the throughput when a huge amount of small queries is to be processed. Enable this setting for the users who instantiates small queries frequently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Default value: **false** (uncompressed cache is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-use_uncompressed_cache). 
merge_tree_max_rows_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in rows of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **128x8192**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_max_bytes_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in bytes of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **192x10x1024x1024**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_min_rows_for_concurrent_read | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of rows to be read from a file to enable concurrent read. If the number of rows to be read exceeds this value, then ClickHouse will try to use a few threads to read from a file concurrently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **20x8192**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_min_bytes_for_concurrent_read | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the number of bytes to be read from a file to enable concurrent read. If the number of bytes to be read exceeds this value, then ClickHouse will try to use a few threads to read from a file concurrently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **24x10x1024x1024**). Value must be greater than 0.
max_bytes_before_external_group_by | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of RAM consumption (in bytes) after that the temporary data, collected during the **GROUP BY** operation, should be flushed to disk to limit the RAM comsumption. <br>By default, aggregation is done by employing hash table that resides in RAM. A query can result in aggregation of huge data volumes that can lead to memory exhaustion and abortion of the query (see the `max_memory_usage` setting). For such queries, you can use this setting to force ClickHouse to do flushing and complete aggregation successfully. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, **GROUP BY** in the external memory is disabled. <br>When using aggregation in external memory, it is recommended to set the value of this setting twice as low as the `max_memory_usage` setting value (by default, the maximum memory usage is limited to ten gigabytes). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/group-by/#select-group-by-in-external-memory). <br>See also: the `distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient` setting. 
max_bytes_before_external_sort | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>This setting is equivalent of the `max_bytes_before_external_group_by` setting, except for it is for sort operation (**ORDER BY**), not aggregation. 
group_by_two_level_threshold | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of the number of keys, after that the two-level aggregation should be used. <br>Minimal value: **0**, threshold is not set (default: **10000**). 
group_by_two_level_threshold_bytes | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of the number of bytes, after that the two-level aggregation should be used. <br>Minimal value: **0**, threshold is not set (default: **100000000**). 
priority | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the priority of a query. <br><ul><li>**0**-priority is not used. </li><li>**1**-the highest priority. </li><li>and so on. The higher the number, the lower a query's priority. </li></ul><br>This setting should be set up for each query individually. <br>If ClickHouse is working with the high-priority queries, and a low-priority query enters, then the low-priority query is paused until higher-priority queries are completed. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, priority is not used. The minimum value is 0.
max_threads | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum number of threads to process the request (setting does not take threads that read data from remote servers into account). <br>This setting applies to threads that perform the same stages of the query processing pipeline in parallel. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0** (the thread number is calculated automatically based on the number of physical CPU cores, no HyperThreading cores are taken into account). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_threads). Value must be greater than 0.
max_memory_usage | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum memory usage (in bytes) for processing of a single user's query on a single server. This setting does not take server's free RAM amount or total RAM amount into account. <br>This limitation is enforced for any user's single query on a single server. <br>Minimal value: **0**, no limitation is set. Value that is set in the ClickHouse default config file: **10737418240** (10 GB). <br>If you use `max_bytes_before_external_group_by` or `max_bytes_before_external_sort` setting, then it is recommended to set their values twice as low as `max_memory_usage` setting value. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/query-complexity/#settings_max_memory_usage). The minimum value is 0.
max_memory_usage_for_user | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum memory usage (in bytes) for processing of user's queries on a single server. This setting does not take server's free RAM amount or total RAM amount into account. <br>This limitation is enforced for all queries that belong to one user and run simultaneously on a single server. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, no limitation is set. The minimum value is 0.
max_network_bandwidth | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>The maximum speed of data exchange over the network in bytes per second for a query. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, no limitation is set. 
max_network_bandwidth_for_user | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>The maximum speed of data exchange over the network in bytes per second for all concurrently running user queries. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, no limitation is set. 
max_partitions_per_insert_block | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/ru/operations/settings/query-complexity/#max-partitions-per-insert-block). 
max_concurrent_queries_for_user | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>The maximum number of concurrent requests per user. Default value: 0 (no limit).

If data to insert suits this storage format, ClickHouse will place them into LowCardinality column. <br>If you use a third-party ClickHouse client that can't work with LowCardinality columns, then this client will not be able to correctly interpret the result of the query that asks for data stored in LowCardinality column. Disable this setting to convert LowCardinality column to regular column when creating the result, so such clients will be able to process the result. <br>Official ClickHouse client works with LowCardinality columns out-of-the-box. <br>Default value: **true** (LowCardinality columns are used in Native format).

insert_quorum | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Enables or disables write quorum for ClickHouse cluster. If the value is less than **2**, then write quorum is disabled, otherwise it is enabled. <br>When used, write quorum guarantees that ClickHouse has written data to the quorum of **insert_quorum** replicas with no errors until the `insert_quorum_timeout` expires. All replicas in the quorum are in the consistent state, meaning that they contain linearized data from the previous **INSERT** queries. Employ write quorum, if you need the guarantees that the written data would not be lost in case of one or more replicas failure. <br>You can use `select_sequential_consistency` setting to read the data written with write quorum. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-insert_quorum). The minimum value is 0.
insert_quorum_timeout | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Quorum write timeout in milliseconds. <br>If the write quorum is enabled in the cluster, this timeout expires and some data is not written to the `insert_quorum` replicas, then ClickHouse will abort the execution of **INSERT** query and return an error. In this case, the client must send the query again to write the data block into the same or another replica. <br>Minimum value: **1000**, 1 second (default: **60000**, 1 minute). The minimum value is 1000.
insert_quorum_parallel | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-insert_quorum_parallel). 
insert_null_as_default | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables the insertion of default values instead of NULL into columns with not nullable data type. <br>Default value: **true**. <br>More info see in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#insert_null_as_default). 
select_sequential_consistency | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines the behavior of **SELECT** queries from the replicated table: if enabled, ClickHouse will terminate a query with error message in case the replica does not have a chunk written with the quorum and will not read the parts that have not yet been written with the quorum. <br>Default value: **false** (sequential consistency is disabled). 
deduplicate_blocks_in_dependent_materialized_views | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-deduplicate-blocks-in-dependent-materialized-views).

Acceptable values are 0 to 2, inclusive.
max_replica_delay_for_distributed_queries | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Max replica delay in milliseconds. If a replica lags more than the set value, this replica is not used and becomes a stale one. <br>Minimum value: **1000**, 1 second (default: **300000**, 300 seconds or 5 minutes). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_replica_delay_for_distributed_queries). The minimum value is 1000.
fallback_to_stale_replicas_for_distributed_queries | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables query forcing to a stale replica in case the actual data is unavailable. If enabled, ClickHouse will choose the most up-to-date replica and force the query to use the data in this replica. This setting can be used when doing **SELECT** query from a distributed table that points to replicated tables. <br>Default value: **true** (query forcing is enabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-fallback_to_stale_replicas_for_distributed_queries). 
distributed_product_mode | enum **DistributedProductMode**<br>Determine the behavior of distributed subqueries. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#distributed-product-mode). <ul><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_DENY`: Default value. Prohibits using these types of subqueries (returns the "Double-distributed in/JOIN subqueries is denied" exception).</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_LOCAL`: Replaces the database and table in the subquery with local ones for the destination server (shard), leaving the normal IN/JOIN.</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_GLOBAL`: Replaces the IN/JOIN query with GLOBAL IN/GLOBAL JOIN.</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_ALLOW`: Allows the use of these types of subqueries.</li></ul>
distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables of disables memory saving mode when doing distributed aggregation. <br>When ClickHouse works with a distributed query, external aggregation is done on remote servers. Enable this setting to achieve a smaller memory footprint on the server that sourced such a distributed query. <br>Default value: **false** (memory saving mode is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/group-by/#select-group-by-in-external-memory).

compile_expressions | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables expression compilation. If you execute a lot of queries that contain identical expressions, then enable this setting. As a result, such queries may be executed faster due to use of compiled expressions. <br>Use this setting in combination with `min_count_to_compile_expression` setting. <br>Default value: **false** (expression compilation is disabled). 
min_count_to_compile_expression | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>How many identical expressions ClickHouse has to encounter before they are compiled. <br>Minimum value: **0** (default: **3**). <br>For the **0** value compilation is synchronous: a query waits for expression compilation process to complete prior to continuing execution. It is recommended to set this value only for testing purposes. <br>For all other values, compilation is asynchronous: the compilation process executes in a separate thread. When a compiled expression is ready, it will be used by ClickHouse for eligible queries, including the ones that are currently running. The minimum value is 0.
max_block_size | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>The maximum block size for reading. <br>Data in ClickHouse is organized and processed by blocks (block is a set of columns' parts). The internal processing cycles for a single block are efficient enough, but there are noticeable expenditures on each block. <br>This setting is a recommendation for size of block (in a count of rows) that should be loaded from tables. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **65536**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-max_block_size).

Blocks that are smaller than the specified value, will be squashed together into the bigger blocks. <br>Minimal value: **0**, block squashing is disabled (default: **1048576**). The minimum value is 0.
min_insert_block_size_bytes | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of bytes in a block to be inserted in a table by **INSERT** query. Blocks that are smaller than the specified value, will be squashed together into the bigger blocks. <br>Minimal value: **0**, block squashing is disabled (default: **268435456**, 256 MB). The minimum value is 0.
max_insert_block_size | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Allows to form blocks of the specified size (in bytes) when inserting data in a table. This setting has effect only if server is creating such blocks by itself. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **1048576**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_insert_block_size). Value must be greater than 0.
min_bytes_to_use_direct_io | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of bytes to enable unbuffered direct reads from disk (Direct I/O). <br>By default, ClickHouse does not read data directly from disk, but relies on the filesystem and its cache instead. Such reading strategy is effective when the data volume is small. If the amount of the data to read is huge, it is more effective to read directly from the disk, bypassing the filesystem cache. <br>If the total amount of the data to read is greater than the value of this setting, then ClickHouse will fetch this data directly from the disk. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, Direct I/O is disabled. The minimum value is 0.
use_uncompressed_cache | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines whether to use the cache of uncompressed blocks, or not. Using this cache can significantly reduce latency and increase the throughput when a huge amount of small queries is to be processed. Enable this setting for the users who instantiates small queries frequently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Default value: **false** (uncompressed cache is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-use_uncompressed_cache). 
merge_tree_max_rows_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in rows of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **128x8192**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_max_bytes_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in bytes of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **192x10x1024x1024**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_min_rows_for_concurrent_read | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of rows to be read from a file to enable concurrent read. If the number of rows to be read exceeds this value, then ClickHouse will try to use a few threads to read from a file concurrently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **20x8192**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_min_bytes_for_concurrent_read | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the number of bytes to be read from a file to enable concurrent read. If the number of bytes to be read exceeds this value, then ClickHouse will try to use a few threads to read from a file concurrently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **24x10x1024x1024**). Value must be greater than 0.
max_bytes_before_external_group_by | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of RAM consumption (in bytes) after that the temporary data, collected during the **GROUP BY** operation, should be flushed to disk to limit the RAM comsumption. <br>By default, aggregation is done by employing hash table that resides in RAM. A query can result in aggregation of huge data volumes that can lead to memory exhaustion and abortion of the query (see the `max_memory_usage` setting). For such queries, you can use this setting to force ClickHouse to do flushing and complete aggregation successfully. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, **GROUP BY** in the external memory is disabled. <br>When using aggregation in external memory, it is recommended to set the value of this setting twice as low as the `max_memory_usage` setting value (by default, the maximum memory usage is limited to ten gigabytes). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/group-by/#select-group-by-in-external-memory). <br>See also: the `distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient` setting. 
max_bytes_before_external_sort | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>This setting is equivalent of the `max_bytes_before_external_group_by` setting, except for it is for sort operation (**ORDER BY**), not aggregation. 
group_by_two_level_threshold | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of the number of keys, after that the two-level aggregation should be used. <br>Minimal value: **0**, threshold is not set (default: **10000**). 
group_by_two_level_threshold_bytes | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of the number of bytes, after that the two-level aggregation should be used. <br>Minimal value: **0**, threshold is not set (default: **100000000**). 
priority | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the priority of a query. <br><ul><li>**0**-priority is not used. </li><li>**1**-the highest priority. </li><li>and so on. The higher the number, the lower a query's priority. </li></ul><br>This setting should be set up for each query individually. <br>If ClickHouse is working with the high-priority queries, and a low-priority query enters, then the low-priority query is paused until higher-priority queries are completed. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, priority is not used. The minimum value is 0.
max_threads | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum number of threads to process the request (setting does not take threads that read data from remote servers into account). <br>This setting applies to threads that perform the same stages of the query processing pipeline in parallel. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0** (the thread number is calculated automatically based on the number of physical CPU cores, no HyperThreading cores are taken into account). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_threads). Value must be greater than 0.
max_memory_usage | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum memory usage (in bytes) for processing of a single user's query on a single server. This setting does not take server's free RAM amount or total RAM amount into account. <br>This limitation is enforced for any user's single query on a single server. <br>Minimal value: **0**, no limitation is set. Value that is set in the ClickHouse default config file: **10737418240** (10 GB). <br>If you use `max_bytes_before_external_group_by` or `max_bytes_before_external_sort` setting, then it is recommended to set their values twice as low as `max_memory_usage` setting value. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/query-complexity/#settings_max_memory_usage). The minimum value is 0.
max_memory_usage_for_user | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum memory usage (in bytes) for processing of user's queries on a single server.

If data to insert suits this storage format, ClickHouse will place them into LowCardinality column. <br>If you use a third-party ClickHouse client that can't work with LowCardinality columns, then this client will not be able to correctly interpret the result of the query that asks for data stored in LowCardinality column. Disable this setting to convert LowCardinality column to regular column when creating the result, so such clients will be able to process the result. <br>Official ClickHouse client works with LowCardinality columns out-of-the-box. <br>Default value: **true** (LowCardinality columns are used in Native format). 
allow_suspicious_low_cardinality_types | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Allows specifying **LowCardinality** modifier for types of small fixed size (8 or less) in CREATE TABLE statements.

insert_quorum | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Enables or disables write quorum for ClickHouse cluster. If the value is less than **2**, then write quorum is disabled, otherwise it is enabled. <br>When used, write quorum guarantees that ClickHouse has written data to the quorum of **insert_quorum** replicas with no errors until the `insert_quorum_timeout` expires. All replicas in the quorum are in the consistent state, meaning that they contain linearized data from the previous **INSERT** queries. Employ write quorum, if you need the guarantees that the written data would not be lost in case of one or more replicas failure. <br>You can use `select_sequential_consistency` setting to read the data written with write quorum. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-insert_quorum). The minimum value is 0.
insert_quorum_timeout | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Quorum write timeout in milliseconds. <br>If the write quorum is enabled in the cluster, this timeout expires and some data is not written to the `insert_quorum` replicas, then ClickHouse will abort the execution of **INSERT** query and return an error. In this case, the client must send the query again to write the data block into the same or another replica. <br>Minimum value: **1000**, 1 second (default: **60000**, 1 minute). The minimum value is 1000.
insert_quorum_parallel | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-insert_quorum_parallel). 
insert_null_as_default | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables the insertion of default values instead of NULL into columns with not nullable data type. <br>Default value: **true**. <br>More info see in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#insert_null_as_default). 
select_sequential_consistency | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines the behavior of **SELECT** queries from the replicated table: if enabled, ClickHouse will terminate a query with error message in case the replica does not have a chunk written with the quorum and will not read the parts that have not yet been written with the quorum. <br>Default value: **false** (sequential consistency is disabled). 
deduplicate_blocks_in_dependent_materialized_views | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-deduplicate-blocks-in-dependent-materialized-views). 
replication_alter_partitions_sync | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Wait mode for asynchronous actions in **ALTER** queries on replicated tables: <br><ul><li>**0**-do not wait for replicas. </li><li>**1**-only wait for own execution (default). </li><li>**2**-wait for all replicas. </li></ul><br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/#synchronicity-of-alter-queries). Acceptable values are 0 to 2, inclusive.
max_replica_delay_for_distributed_queries | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Max replica delay in milliseconds. If a replica lags more than the set value, this replica is not used and becomes a stale one. <br>Minimum value: **1000**, 1 second (default: **300000**, 300 seconds or 5 minutes). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_replica_delay_for_distributed_queries). The minimum value is 1000.
fallback_to_stale_replicas_for_distributed_queries | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables query forcing to a stale replica in case the actual data is unavailable. If enabled, ClickHouse will choose the most up-to-date replica and force the query to use the data in this replica. This setting can be used when doing **SELECT** query from a distributed table that points to replicated tables. <br>Default value: **true** (query forcing is enabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-fallback_to_stale_replicas_for_distributed_queries). 
distributed_product_mode | enum **DistributedProductMode**<br>Determine the behavior of distributed subqueries. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#distributed-product-mode). <ul><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_DENY`: Default value. Prohibits using these types of subqueries (returns the "Double-distributed in/JOIN subqueries is denied" exception).</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_LOCAL`: Replaces the database and table in the subquery with local ones for the destination server (shard), leaving the normal IN/JOIN.</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_GLOBAL`: Replaces the IN/JOIN query with GLOBAL IN/GLOBAL JOIN.</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_ALLOW`: Allows the use of these types of subqueries.</li></ul>
distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables of disables memory saving mode when doing distributed aggregation. <br>When ClickHouse works with a distributed query, external aggregation is done on remote servers. Enable this setting to achieve a smaller memory footprint on the server that sourced such a distributed query. <br>Default value: **false** (memory saving mode is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/group-by/#select-group-by-in-external-memory).

skip_unavailable_shards | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables silent skipping of unavailable shards. <br>A shard is considered unavailable if all its replicas are also unavailable. <br>Default value: **false** (silent skipping is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-skip_unavailable_shards). 
compile_expressions | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables expression compilation. If you execute a lot of queries that contain identical expressions, then enable this setting. As a result, such queries may be executed faster due to use of compiled expressions. <br>Use this setting in combination with `min_count_to_compile_expression` setting. <br>Default value: **false** (expression compilation is disabled). 
min_count_to_compile_expression | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>How many identical expressions ClickHouse has to encounter before they are compiled. <br>Minimum value: **0** (default: **3**). <br>For the **0** value compilation is synchronous: a query waits for expression compilation process to complete prior to continuing execution. It is recommended to set this value only for testing purposes. <br>For all other values, compilation is asynchronous: the compilation process executes in a separate thread. When a compiled expression is ready, it will be used by ClickHouse for eligible queries, including the ones that are currently running. The minimum value is 0.
max_block_size | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>The maximum block size for reading. <br>Data in ClickHouse is organized and processed by blocks (block is a set of columns' parts). The internal processing cycles for a single block are efficient enough, but there are noticeable expenditures on each block. <br>This setting is a recommendation for size of block (in a count of rows) that should be loaded from tables. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **65536**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-max_block_size). Value must be greater than 0.
min_insert_block_size_rows | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of rows in a block to be inserted in a table by **INSERT** query. Blocks that are smaller than the specified value, will be squashed together into the bigger blocks. <br>Minimal value: **0**, block squashing is disabled (default: **1048576**). The minimum value is 0.
min_insert_block_size_bytes | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of bytes in a block to be inserted in a table by **INSERT** query. Blocks that are smaller than the specified value, will be squashed together into the bigger blocks. <br>Minimal value: **0**, block squashing is disabled (default: **268435456**, 256 MB). The minimum value is 0.
max_insert_block_size | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Allows to form blocks of the specified size (in bytes) when inserting data in a table. This setting has effect only if server is creating such blocks by itself. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **1048576**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_insert_block_size). Value must be greater than 0.
min_bytes_to_use_direct_io | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of bytes to enable unbuffered direct reads from disk (Direct I/O). <br>By default, ClickHouse does not read data directly from disk, but relies on the filesystem and its cache instead. Such reading strategy is effective when the data volume is small. If the amount of the data to read is huge, it is more effective to read directly from the disk, bypassing the filesystem cache. <br>If the total amount of the data to read is greater than the value of this setting, then ClickHouse will fetch this data directly from the disk. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, Direct I/O is disabled. The minimum value is 0.
use_uncompressed_cache | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines whether to use the cache of uncompressed blocks, or not. Using this cache can significantly reduce latency and increase the throughput when a huge amount of small queries is to be processed. Enable this setting for the users who instantiates small queries frequently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Default value: **false** (uncompressed cache is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-use_uncompressed_cache). 
merge_tree_max_rows_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in rows of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **128x8192**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_max_bytes_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in bytes of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **192x10x1024x1024**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_min_rows_for_concurrent_read | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of rows to be read from a file to enable concurrent read. If the number of rows to be read exceeds this value, then ClickHouse will try to use a few threads to read from a file concurrently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **20x8192**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_min_bytes_for_concurrent_read | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the number of bytes to be read from a file to enable concurrent read. If the number of bytes to be read exceeds this value, then ClickHouse will try to use a few threads to read from a file concurrently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **24x10x1024x1024**). Value must be greater than 0.
max_bytes_before_external_group_by | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of RAM consumption (in bytes) after that the temporary data, collected during the **GROUP BY** operation, should be flushed to disk to limit the RAM comsumption. <br>By default, aggregation is done by employing hash table that resides in RAM. A query can result in aggregation of huge data volumes that can lead to memory exhaustion and abortion of the query (see the `max_memory_usage` setting). For such queries, you can use this setting to force ClickHouse to do flushing and complete aggregation successfully. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, **GROUP BY** in the external memory is disabled. <br>When using aggregation in external memory, it is recommended to set the value of this setting twice as low as the `max_memory_usage` setting value (by default, the maximum memory usage is limited to ten gigabytes). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/group-by/#select-group-by-in-external-memory). <br>See also: the `distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient` setting. 
max_bytes_before_external_sort | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>This setting is equivalent of the `max_bytes_before_external_group_by` setting, except for it is for sort operation (**ORDER BY**), not aggregation. 
group_by_two_level_threshold | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of the number of keys, after that the two-level aggregation should be used. <br>Minimal value: **0**, threshold is not set (default: **10000**). 
group_by_two_level_threshold_bytes | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of the number of bytes, after that the two-level aggregation should be used. <br>Minimal value: **0**, threshold is not set (default: **100000000**). 
priority | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the priority of a query. <br><ul><li>**0**-priority is not used. </li><li>**1**-the highest priority. </li><li>and so on. The higher the number, the lower a query's priority. </li></ul><br>This setting should be set up for each query individually. <br>If ClickHouse is working with the high-priority queries, and a low-priority query enters, then the low-priority query is paused until higher-priority queries are completed. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, priority is not used. The minimum value is 0.

If data to insert suits this storage format, ClickHouse will place them into LowCardinality column. <br>If you use a third-party ClickHouse client that can't work with LowCardinality columns, then this client will not be able to correctly interpret the result of the query that asks for data stored in LowCardinality column. Disable this setting to convert LowCardinality column to regular column when creating the result, so such clients will be able to process the result. <br>Official ClickHouse client works with LowCardinality columns out-of-the-box. <br>Default value: **true** (LowCardinality columns are used in Native format). 
allow_suspicious_low_cardinality_types | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Allows specifying **LowCardinality** modifier for types of small fixed size (8 or less) in CREATE TABLE statements.

If the value is less than **2**, then write quorum is disabled, otherwise it is enabled. <br>When used, write quorum guarantees that ClickHouse has written data to the quorum of **insert_quorum** replicas with no errors until the `insert_quorum_timeout` expires. All replicas in the quorum are in the consistent state, meaning that they contain linearized data from the previous **INSERT** queries. Employ write quorum, if you need the guarantees that the written data would not be lost in case of one or more replicas failure. <br>You can use `select_sequential_consistency` setting to read the data written with write quorum. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-insert_quorum). The minimum value is 0.
insert_quorum_timeout | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Quorum write timeout in milliseconds. <br>If the write quorum is enabled in the cluster, this timeout expires and some data is not written to the `insert_quorum` replicas, then ClickHouse will abort the execution of **INSERT** query and return an error. In this case, the client must send the query again to write the data block into the same or another replica. <br>Minimum value: **1000**, 1 second (default: **60000**, 1 minute). The minimum value is 1000.
insert_quorum_parallel | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-insert_quorum_parallel). 
insert_null_as_default | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables the insertion of default values instead of NULL into columns with not nullable data type. <br>Default value: **true**. <br>More info see in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#insert_null_as_default). 
select_sequential_consistency | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines the behavior of **SELECT** queries from the replicated table: if enabled, ClickHouse will terminate a query with error message in case the replica does not have a chunk written with the quorum and will not read the parts that have not yet been written with the quorum. <br>Default value: **false** (sequential consistency is disabled). 
deduplicate_blocks_in_dependent_materialized_views | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-deduplicate-blocks-in-dependent-materialized-views). 
replication_alter_partitions_sync | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Wait mode for asynchronous actions in **ALTER** queries on replicated tables: <br><ul><li>**0**-do not wait for replicas. </li><li>**1**-only wait for own execution (default). </li><li>**2**-wait for all replicas. </li></ul><br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/#synchronicity-of-alter-queries). Acceptable values are 0 to 2, inclusive.
max_replica_delay_for_distributed_queries | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Max replica delay in milliseconds. If a replica lags more than the set value, this replica is not used and becomes a stale one. <br>Minimum value: **1000**, 1 second (default: **300000**, 300 seconds or 5 minutes). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_replica_delay_for_distributed_queries). The minimum value is 1000.
fallback_to_stale_replicas_for_distributed_queries | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables query forcing to a stale replica in case the actual data is unavailable. If enabled, ClickHouse will choose the most up-to-date replica and force the query to use the data in this replica. This setting can be used when doing **SELECT** query from a distributed table that points to replicated tables. <br>Default value: **true** (query forcing is enabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-fallback_to_stale_replicas_for_distributed_queries). 
distributed_product_mode | enum **DistributedProductMode**<br>Determine the behavior of distributed subqueries. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#distributed-product-mode). <ul><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_DENY`: Default value. Prohibits using these types of subqueries (returns the "Double-distributed in/JOIN subqueries is denied" exception).</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_LOCAL`: Replaces the database and table in the subquery with local ones for the destination server (shard), leaving the normal IN/JOIN.</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_GLOBAL`: Replaces the IN/JOIN query with GLOBAL IN/GLOBAL JOIN.</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_ALLOW`: Allows the use of these types of subqueries.</li></ul>
distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables of disables memory saving mode when doing distributed aggregation. <br>When ClickHouse works with a distributed query, external aggregation is done on remote servers. Enable this setting to achieve a smaller memory footprint on the server that sourced such a distributed query. <br>Default value: **false** (memory saving mode is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/group-by/#select-group-by-in-external-memory).

compile_expressions | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables expression compilation. If you execute a lot of queries that contain identical expressions, then enable this setting. As a result, such queries may be executed faster due to use of compiled expressions. <br>Use this setting in combination with `min_count_to_compile_expression` setting. <br>Default value: **false** (expression compilation is disabled). 
min_count_to_compile_expression | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>How many identical expressions ClickHouse has to encounter before they are compiled. <br>Minimum value: **0** (default: **3**). <br>For the **0** value compilation is synchronous: a query waits for expression compilation process to complete prior to continuing execution. It is recommended to set this value only for testing purposes. <br>For all other values, compilation is asynchronous: the compilation process executes in a separate thread. When a compiled expression is ready, it will be used by ClickHouse for eligible queries, including the ones that are currently running. The minimum value is 0.
max_block_size | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>The maximum block size for reading. <br>Data in ClickHouse is organized and processed by blocks (block is a set of columns' parts). The internal processing cycles for a single block are efficient enough, but there are noticeable expenditures on each block. <br>This setting is a recommendation for size of block (in a count of rows) that should be loaded from tables. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **65536**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-max_block_size). Value must be greater than 0.

Blocks that are smaller than the specified value, will be squashed together into the bigger blocks. <br>Minimal value: **0**, block squashing is disabled (default: **1048576**). The minimum value is 0.
min_insert_block_size_bytes | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of bytes in a block to be inserted in a table by **INSERT** query. Blocks that are smaller than the specified value, will be squashed together into the bigger blocks. <br>Minimal value: **0**, block squashing is disabled (default: **268435456**, 256 MB). The minimum value is 0.
max_insert_block_size | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Allows to form blocks of the specified size (in bytes) when inserting data in a table. This setting has effect only if server is creating such blocks by itself. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **1048576**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_insert_block_size). Value must be greater than 0.
min_bytes_to_use_direct_io | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of bytes to enable unbuffered direct reads from disk (Direct I/O). <br>By default, ClickHouse does not read data directly from disk, but relies on the filesystem and its cache instead. Such reading strategy is effective when the data volume is small. If the amount of the data to read is huge, it is more effective to read directly from the disk, bypassing the filesystem cache. <br>If the total amount of the data to read is greater than the value of this setting, then ClickHouse will fetch this data directly from the disk. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, Direct I/O is disabled. The minimum value is 0.
use_uncompressed_cache | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines whether to use the cache of uncompressed blocks, or not. Using this cache can significantly reduce latency and increase the throughput when a huge amount of small queries is to be processed. Enable this setting for the users who instantiates small queries frequently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Default value: **false** (uncompressed cache is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-use_uncompressed_cache). 
merge_tree_max_rows_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in rows of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **128x8192**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_max_bytes_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in bytes of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **192x10x1024x1024**).

A query can result in aggregation of huge data volumes that can lead to memory exhaustion and abortion of the query (see the `max_memory_usage` setting). For such queries, you can use this setting to force ClickHouse to do flushing and complete aggregation successfully. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, **GROUP BY** in the external memory is disabled. <br>When using aggregation in external memory, it is recommended to set the value of this setting twice as low as the `max_memory_usage` setting value (by default, the maximum memory usage is limited to ten gigabytes). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/group-by/#select-group-by-in-external-memory). <br>See also: the `distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient` setting.

If data to insert suits this storage format, ClickHouse will place them into LowCardinality column. <br>If you use a third-party ClickHouse client that can't work with LowCardinality columns, then this client will not be able to correctly interpret the result of the query that asks for data stored in LowCardinality column. Disable this setting to convert LowCardinality column to regular column when creating the result, so such clients will be able to process the result. <br>Official ClickHouse client works with LowCardinality columns out-of-the-box. <br>Default value: **true** (LowCardinality columns are used in Native format). 
allow_suspicious_low_cardinality_types | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Allows specifying **LowCardinality** modifier for types of small fixed size (8 or less) in CREATE TABLE statements.

If you execute a lot of queries that contain identical expressions, then enable this setting. As a result, such queries may be executed faster due to use of compiled expressions. <br>Use this setting in combination with `min_count_to_compile_expression` setting. <br>Default value: **false** (expression compilation is disabled). 
min_count_to_compile_expression | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>How many identical expressions ClickHouse has to encounter before they are compiled. <br>Minimum value: **0** (default: **3**). <br>For the **0** value compilation is synchronous: a query waits for expression compilation process to complete prior to continuing execution. It is recommended to set this value only for testing purposes. <br>For all other values, compilation is asynchronous: the compilation process executes in a separate thread. When a compiled expression is ready, it will be used by ClickHouse for eligible queries, including the ones that are currently running. The minimum value is 0.
max_block_size | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>The maximum block size for reading. <br>Data in ClickHouse is organized and processed by blocks (block is a set of columns' parts). The internal processing cycles for a single block are efficient enough, but there are noticeable expenditures on each block. <br>This setting is a recommendation for size of block (in a count of rows) that should be loaded from tables. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **65536**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-max_block_size).

This setting has effect only if server is creating such blocks by itself. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **1048576**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_insert_block_size). Value must be greater than 0.
min_bytes_to_use_direct_io | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of bytes to enable unbuffered direct reads from disk (Direct I/O). <br>By default, ClickHouse does not read data directly from disk, but relies on the filesystem and its cache instead. Such reading strategy is effective when the data volume is small. If the amount of the data to read is huge, it is more effective to read directly from the disk, bypassing the filesystem cache. <br>If the total amount of the data to read is greater than the value of this setting, then ClickHouse will fetch this data directly from the disk. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, Direct I/O is disabled. The minimum value is 0.
use_uncompressed_cache | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines whether to use the cache of uncompressed blocks, or not. Using this cache can significantly reduce latency and increase the throughput when a huge amount of small queries is to be processed. Enable this setting for the users who instantiates small queries frequently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Default value: **false** (uncompressed cache is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-use_uncompressed_cache). 
merge_tree_max_rows_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in rows of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **128x8192**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_max_bytes_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in bytes of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **192x10x1024x1024**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_min_rows_for_concurrent_read | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of rows to be read from a file to enable concurrent read. If the number of rows to be read exceeds this value, then ClickHouse will try to use a few threads to read from a file concurrently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **20x8192**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_min_bytes_for_concurrent_read | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the number of bytes to be read from a file to enable concurrent read. If the number of bytes to be read exceeds this value, then ClickHouse will try to use a few threads to read from a file concurrently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **24x10x1024x1024**). Value must be greater than 0.
max_bytes_before_external_group_by | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of RAM consumption (in bytes) after that the temporary data, collected during the **GROUP BY** operation, should be flushed to disk to limit the RAM comsumption. <br>By default, aggregation is done by employing hash table that resides in RAM. A query can result in aggregation of huge data volumes that can lead to memory exhaustion and abortion of the query (see the `max_memory_usage` setting). For such queries, you can use this setting to force ClickHouse to do flushing and complete aggregation successfully. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, **GROUP BY** in the external memory is disabled. <br>When using aggregation in external memory, it is recommended to set the value of this setting twice as low as the `max_memory_usage` setting value (by default, the maximum memory usage is limited to ten gigabytes). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/group-by/#select-group-by-in-external-memory). <br>See also: the `distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient` setting. 
max_bytes_before_external_sort | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>This setting is equivalent of the `max_bytes_before_external_group_by` setting, except for it is for sort operation (**ORDER BY**), not aggregation. 
group_by_two_level_threshold | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of the number of keys, after that the two-level aggregation should be used. <br>Minimal value: **0**, threshold is not set (default: **10000**).

Value must be greater than 0.
max_memory_usage | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum memory usage (in bytes) for processing of a single user's query on a single server. This setting does not take server's free RAM amount or total RAM amount into account. <br>This limitation is enforced for any user's single query on a single server. <br>Minimal value: **0**, no limitation is set. Value that is set in the ClickHouse default config file: **10737418240** (10 GB). <br>If you use `max_bytes_before_external_group_by` or `max_bytes_before_external_sort` setting, then it is recommended to set their values twice as low as `max_memory_usage` setting value. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/query-complexity/#settings_max_memory_usage). The minimum value is 0.

If data to insert suits this storage format, ClickHouse will place them into LowCardinality column. <br>If you use a third-party ClickHouse client that can't work with LowCardinality columns, then this client will not be able to correctly interpret the result of the query that asks for data stored in LowCardinality column. Disable this setting to convert LowCardinality column to regular column when creating the result, so such clients will be able to process the result. <br>Official ClickHouse client works with LowCardinality columns out-of-the-box. <br>Default value: **true** (LowCardinality columns are used in Native format). 
allow_suspicious_low_cardinality_types | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Allows specifying **LowCardinality** modifier for types of small fixed size (8 or less) in CREATE TABLE statements.

timeout_before_checking_execution_speed | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Timeout (in seconds) between checks of execution speed. It is checked that execution speed is not less that specified in `min_execution_speed` parameter. <br>Default value: **10**. 
insert_quorum | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Enables or disables write quorum for ClickHouse cluster. If the value is less than **2**, then write quorum is disabled, otherwise it is enabled. <br>When used, write quorum guarantees that ClickHouse has written data to the quorum of **insert_quorum** replicas with no errors until the `insert_quorum_timeout` expires. All replicas in the quorum are in the consistent state, meaning that they contain linearized data from the previous **INSERT** queries. Employ write quorum, if you need the guarantees that the written data would not be lost in case of one or more replicas failure. <br>You can use `select_sequential_consistency` setting to read the data written with write quorum. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-insert_quorum). The minimum value is 0.
insert_quorum_timeout | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Quorum write timeout in milliseconds. <br>If the write quorum is enabled in the cluster, this timeout expires and some data is not written to the `insert_quorum` replicas, then ClickHouse will abort the execution of **INSERT** query and return an error. In this case, the client must send the query again to write the data block into the same or another replica. <br>Minimum value: **1000**, 1 second (default: **60000**, 1 minute). The minimum value is 1000.
insert_quorum_parallel | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-insert_quorum_parallel). 
insert_null_as_default | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables the insertion of default values instead of NULL into columns with not nullable data type. <br>Default value: **true**. <br>More info see in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#insert_null_as_default). 
select_sequential_consistency | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines the behavior of **SELECT** queries from the replicated table: if enabled, ClickHouse will terminate a query with error message in case the replica does not have a chunk written with the quorum and will not read the parts that have not yet been written with the quorum. <br>Default value: **false** (sequential consistency is disabled). 
deduplicate_blocks_in_dependent_materialized_views | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-deduplicate-blocks-in-dependent-materialized-views).

Acceptable values are 0 to 2, inclusive.
max_replica_delay_for_distributed_queries | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Max replica delay in milliseconds. If a replica lags more than the set value, this replica is not used and becomes a stale one. <br>Minimum value: **1000**, 1 second (default: **300000**, 300 seconds or 5 minutes). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_replica_delay_for_distributed_queries). The minimum value is 1000.
fallback_to_stale_replicas_for_distributed_queries | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables query forcing to a stale replica in case the actual data is unavailable. If enabled, ClickHouse will choose the most up-to-date replica and force the query to use the data in this replica. This setting can be used when doing **SELECT** query from a distributed table that points to replicated tables. <br>Default value: **true** (query forcing is enabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-fallback_to_stale_replicas_for_distributed_queries). 
distributed_product_mode | enum **DistributedProductMode**<br>Determine the behavior of distributed subqueries. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#distributed-product-mode). <ul><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_DENY`: Default value. Prohibits using these types of subqueries (returns the "Double-distributed in/JOIN subqueries is denied" exception).</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_LOCAL`: Replaces the database and table in the subquery with local ones for the destination server (shard), leaving the normal IN/JOIN.</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_GLOBAL`: Replaces the IN/JOIN query with GLOBAL IN/GLOBAL JOIN.</li><li>`DISTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_MODE_ALLOW`: Allows the use of these types of subqueries.</li></ul>
distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables of disables memory saving mode when doing distributed aggregation. <br>When ClickHouse works with a distributed query, external aggregation is done on remote servers. Enable this setting to achieve a smaller memory footprint on the server that sourced such a distributed query. <br>Default value: **false** (memory saving mode is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/group-by/#select-group-by-in-external-memory).

compile_expressions | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Enables or disables expression compilation. If you execute a lot of queries that contain identical expressions, then enable this setting. As a result, such queries may be executed faster due to use of compiled expressions. <br>Use this setting in combination with `min_count_to_compile_expression` setting. <br>Default value: **false** (expression compilation is disabled). 
min_count_to_compile_expression | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>How many identical expressions ClickHouse has to encounter before they are compiled. <br>Minimum value: **0** (default: **3**). <br>For the **0** value compilation is synchronous: a query waits for expression compilation process to complete prior to continuing execution. It is recommended to set this value only for testing purposes. <br>For all other values, compilation is asynchronous: the compilation process executes in a separate thread. When a compiled expression is ready, it will be used by ClickHouse for eligible queries, including the ones that are currently running. The minimum value is 0.
max_block_size | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>The maximum block size for reading. <br>Data in ClickHouse is organized and processed by blocks (block is a set of columns' parts). The internal processing cycles for a single block are efficient enough, but there are noticeable expenditures on each block. <br>This setting is a recommendation for size of block (in a count of rows) that should be loaded from tables. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **65536**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-max_block_size).

Blocks that are smaller than the specified value, will be squashed together into the bigger blocks. <br>Minimal value: **0**, block squashing is disabled (default: **1048576**). The minimum value is 0.
min_insert_block_size_bytes | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of bytes in a block to be inserted in a table by **INSERT** query. Blocks that are smaller than the specified value, will be squashed together into the bigger blocks. <br>Minimal value: **0**, block squashing is disabled (default: **268435456**, 256 MB). The minimum value is 0.

This setting has effect only if server is creating such blocks by itself. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **1048576**). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_insert_block_size). Value must be greater than 0.
min_bytes_to_use_direct_io | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of bytes to enable unbuffered direct reads from disk (Direct I/O). <br>By default, ClickHouse does not read data directly from disk, but relies on the filesystem and its cache instead. Such reading strategy is effective when the data volume is small. If the amount of the data to read is huge, it is more effective to read directly from the disk, bypassing the filesystem cache. <br>If the total amount of the data to read is greater than the value of this setting, then ClickHouse will fetch this data directly from the disk. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, Direct I/O is disabled. The minimum value is 0.
use_uncompressed_cache | **[google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value)**<br>Determines whether to use the cache of uncompressed blocks, or not. Using this cache can significantly reduce latency and increase the throughput when a huge amount of small queries is to be processed. Enable this setting for the users who instantiates small queries frequently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Default value: **false** (uncompressed cache is disabled). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#setting-use_uncompressed_cache). 
merge_tree_max_rows_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in rows of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **128x8192**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_max_bytes_to_use_cache | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum size in bytes of the request that can use the cache of uncompressed data. The cache is not used for requests larger than the specified value. <br>Use this setting in combination with `use_uncompressed_cache` setting. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **192x10x1024x1024**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_min_rows_for_concurrent_read | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the minimum number of rows to be read from a file to enable concurrent read. If the number of rows to be read exceeds this value, then ClickHouse will try to use a few threads to read from a file concurrently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **20x8192**). Value must be greater than 0.
merge_tree_min_bytes_for_concurrent_read | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the number of bytes to be read from a file to enable concurrent read. If the number of bytes to be read exceeds this value, then ClickHouse will try to use a few threads to read from a file concurrently. <br>This setting has effect only for tables of the MergeTree family. <br>Value must be greater than **0** (default: **24x10x1024x1024**). Value must be greater than 0.
max_bytes_before_external_group_by | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of RAM consumption (in bytes) after that the temporary data, collected during the **GROUP BY** operation, should be flushed to disk to limit the RAM comsumption. <br>By default, aggregation is done by employing hash table that resides in RAM. A query can result in aggregation of huge data volumes that can lead to memory exhaustion and abortion of the query (see the `max_memory_usage` setting). For such queries, you can use this setting to force ClickHouse to do flushing and complete aggregation successfully. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, **GROUP BY** in the external memory is disabled. <br>When using aggregation in external memory, it is recommended to set the value of this setting twice as low as the `max_memory_usage` setting value (by default, the maximum memory usage is limited to ten gigabytes). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/group-by/#select-group-by-in-external-memory). <br>See also: the `distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient` setting. 
max_bytes_before_external_sort | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>This setting is equivalent of the `max_bytes_before_external_group_by` setting, except for it is for sort operation (**ORDER BY**), not aggregation. 
group_by_two_level_threshold | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of the number of keys, after that the two-level aggregation should be used. <br>Minimal value: **0**, threshold is not set (default: **10000**). 
group_by_two_level_threshold_bytes | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Sets the threshold of the number of bytes, after that the two-level aggregation should be used. <br>Minimal value: **0**, threshold is not set (default: **100000000**).

The higher the number, the lower a query's priority. </li></ul><br>This setting should be set up for each query individually. <br>If ClickHouse is working with the high-priority queries, and a low-priority query enters, then the low-priority query is paused until higher-priority queries are completed. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0**, priority is not used. The minimum value is 0.
max_threads | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum number of threads to process the request (setting does not take threads that read data from remote servers into account). <br>This setting applies to threads that perform the same stages of the query processing pipeline in parallel. <br>Minimal value and default value: **0** (the thread number is calculated automatically based on the number of physical CPU cores, no HyperThreading cores are taken into account). <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_threads). Value must be greater than 0.
max_memory_usage | **[google.protobuf.Int64Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/int64-value)**<br>Limits the maximum memory usage (in bytes) for processing of a single user's query on a single server. This setting does not take server's free RAM amount or total RAM amount into account. <br>This limitation is enforced for any user's single query on a single server. <br>Minimal value: **0**, no limitation is set. Value that is set in the ClickHouse default config file: **10737418240** (10 GB). <br>If you use `max_bytes_before_external_group_by` or `max_bytes_before_external_sort` setting, then it is recommended to set their values twice as low as `max_memory_usage` setting value. <br>See in-depth description in [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/query-complexity/#settings_max_memory_usage). The minimum value is 0.

If data to insert suits this storage format, ClickHouse will place them into LowCardinality column. <br>If you use a third-party ClickHouse client that can't work with LowCardinality columns, then this client will not be able to correctly interpret the result of the query that asks for data stored in LowCardinality column. Disable this setting to convert LowCardinality column to regular column when creating the result, so such clients will be able to process the result. <br>Official ClickHouse client works with LowCardinality columns out-of-the-box. <br>Default value: **true** (LowCardinality columns are used in Native format).
