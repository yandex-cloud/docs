value | **string**<br>The taint value corresponding to the taint key. 
effect | enum **Effect**<br>The effect of the taint on pods that do not tolerate the taint. <ul><li>`NO_SCHEDULE`: Do not allow new pods to schedule onto the node unless they tolerate the taint, but allow all pods submitted to Kubelet without going through the scheduler to start, and allow all already-running pods to continue running.</li><li>`PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE`: Like NO_SCHEDULE, but the scheduler tries not to schedule new pods onto the node, rather than prohibiting new pods from scheduling onto the node entirely. Enforced by the scheduler.</li><li>`NO_EXECUTE`: Evict any already-running pods that do not tolerate the taint.</li></ul>
