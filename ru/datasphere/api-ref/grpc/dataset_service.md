## Calls DatasetService {#calls}

## Activate {#Activate}

Activates shared dataset for project

**rpc Activate ([ActivateDatasetRequest](#ActivateDatasetRequest)) returns ([operation.Operation](#Operation))**

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation.response:[google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty)<br>

### ActivateDatasetRequest {#ActivateDatasetRequest}

Field | Description
--- | ---
dataset_id | **string**<br>Required.  The maximum string length in characters is 50.
project_id | **string**<br>Required.  The maximum string length in characters is 50.


### Operation {#Operation}

Field | Description
--- | ---
id | **string**<br>ID of the operation. 
description | **string**<br>Description of the operation. 0-256 characters long. 
created_at | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**<br>Creation timestamp. 
created_by | **string**<br>ID of the user or service account who initiated the operation. 
modified_at | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**<br>The time when the Operation resource was last modified. 
done | **bool**<br>If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. 
metadata | **[google.protobuf.Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any)**<br>Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains the ID of the target resource that the operation is performed on. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. 
result | **oneof:** `error` or `response`<br>The operation result. If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set. If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set. If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set.
&nbsp;&nbsp;error | **[google.rpc.Status](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/reference/rpc/google.rpc#status)**<br>The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;response | **[google.protobuf.Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any)<[google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty)>**<br>if operation finished successfully. 


## Deactivate {#Deactivate}

Deactivates shared dataset for project

**rpc Deactivate ([DeactivateDatasetRequest](#DeactivateDatasetRequest)) returns ([operation.Operation](#Operation1))**

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation.response:[google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty)<br>

### DeactivateDatasetRequest {#DeactivateDatasetRequest}
