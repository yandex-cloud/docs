# yandex_alb_backend_group (Data Source)

Get information about a Yandex Application Load Balancer Backend Group. For more information, see [official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/application-load-balancer/quickstart).

This data source is used to define [Application Load Balancer Backend Groups](https://yandex.cloud/docs/application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group) that can be used by other resources.

~> One of `backend_group_id` or `name` should be specified.

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Get information about existing ALB Backend Group
//
data "yandex_alb_backend_group" "my_alb_bg" {
  backend_group_id = yandex_alb_backend_group.my_backend_group.id
}
```
