# yandex_cdn_resource (Data Source)

Allows management of [Yandex Cloud CDN Resource](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cdn/concepts/resource).

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Get information about existing CDN Resource
//
data "yandex_cdn_resource" "my_resource" {
  resource_id = "some resource id"
}

output "resource_cname" {
  value = data.yandex_cdn_resource.my_resource.cname
}
```
