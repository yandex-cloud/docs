# yandex_compute_filesystem (Resource)

File storage is a virtual file system that can be attached to multiple Compute Cloud VMs in the same availability zone.

Users can share files in storage and use them from different VMs.

Storage is attached to a VM through the [Filesystem in Userspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) (FUSE) interface as a [virtiofs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/virtiofs.html) device that is not linked to the host file system directly.

For more information about filesystems in Yandex Cloud, see:
* [Documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/compute/concepts/filesystem)
* How-to Guides
  * [Attach filesystem to a VM](https://yandex.cloud/docs/compute/operations/filesystem/attach-to-vm)
  * [Detach filesystem from VM](https://yandex.cloud/docs/compute/operations/filesystem/detach-from-vm)

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new Compute Filesystem.
//
resource "yandex_compute_filesystem" "default" {
  name = "fs-name"
  type = "network-ssd"
  zone = "ru-central1-a"
  size = 10

  labels = {
    environment = "test"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `block_size` (Number) Block size of the filesystem, specified in bytes.
- `description` (String) The resource description.
- `folder_id` (String) The folder identifier that resource belongs to. If it is not provided, the default provider `folder-id` is used.
- `labels` (Map of String) A set of key/value label pairs which assigned to resource.
- `name` (String) The resource name.
- `size` (Number) Size of the filesystem, specified in GB.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `type` (String) Type of filesystem to create. Type `network-hdd` is set by default.
- `zone` (String) The [availability zone](https://yandex.cloud/docs/overview/concepts/geo-scope) where resource is located. If it is not provided, the default provider zone will be used.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The creation timestamp of the resource.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `status` (String) The status of the filesystem.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```bash
# terraform import yandex_compute_filesystem.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_compute_filesystem.my_filesystem fhmc7**********ngipq
```
