# yandex_iam_service_account_iam_policy (Resource)

**IAM policy for a service account**
When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a resource or as an identity. This resource is used to add IAM policy bindings to a service account resource to configure permissions that define who can edit the service account.

There are three different resources that help you manage your IAM policy for a service account. Each of these resources is used for a different use case:
* [yandex_iam_service_account_iam_policy](iam_service_account_iam_policy.html): Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the service account and replaces any existing policy already attached.
* [yandex_iam_service_account_iam_binding](iam_service_account_iam_binding.html): Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the service account are preserved.
* [yandex_iam_service_account_iam_member](iam_service_account_iam_member.html): Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role of the service account are preserved.

{% note warning %}

`yandex_iam_service_account_iam_policy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `yandex_iam_service_account_iam_binding` and `yandex_iam_service_account_iam_member` or they will conflict over what your policy should be.

{% endnote %}


{% note warning %}

`yandex_iam_service_account_iam_binding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `yandex_iam_service_account_iam_member` resources **only if** they do not grant privileges to the same role.

{% endnote %}


## Example usage

  }
}

resource "yandex_iam_service_account_iam_policy" "admin-account-iam" {
