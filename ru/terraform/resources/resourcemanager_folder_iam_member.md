# yandex_resourcemanager_folder_iam_member (Resource)

Allows creation and management of a single member for a single binding within the IAM policy for an existing Yandex Resource Manager folder.

~> This resource *must not* be used in conjunction with `yandex_resourcemanager_folder_iam_policy` or they will conflict over what your policy should be. Similarly, roles controlled by `yandex_resourcemanager_folder_iam_binding` should not be assigned using `yandex_resourcemanager_folder_iam_member`.

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new IAM Member for existing Folder.
//
data "yandex_resourcemanager_folder" "department1" {
  folder_id = "some_folder_id"
}

resource "yandex_resourcemanager_folder_iam_member" "admin" {
  folder_id = data.yandex_resourcemanager.department1.name

  role   = "editor"
  member = "userAccount:user_id"
}
```
