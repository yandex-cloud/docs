# yandex_vpc_route_table (Resource)

Manages a route table within the Yandex Cloud. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/vpc/concepts).

* How-to Guides
  * [Cloud Networking](https://yandex.cloud/docs/vpc/)

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new VPC Route Table.
//
resource "yandex_vpc_route_table" "lab-rt-a" {
  network_id = yandex_vpc_network.lab-net.id

  static_route {
    destination_prefix = "10.2.0.0/16"
    next_hop_address   = "172.16.10.10"
  }

  static_route {
    destination_prefix = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id         = yandex_vpc_gateway.egress-gateway.id
  }
}

// Auxiliary resources
resource "yandex_vpc_network" "lab-net" {
  name = "lab-network"
}

resource "yandex_vpc_gateway" "egress-gateway" {
  name = "egress-gateway"
  shared_egress_gateway {}
}

## Schema

### Required

- `network_id` (String) ID of the network this route table belongs to.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The resource description.
- `folder_id` (String) The folder identifier that resource belongs to. If it is not provided, the default provider `folder-id` is used.
- `labels` (Map of String) A set of key/value label pairs which assigned to resource.
- `name` (String) The resource name.
- `static_route` (Block Set) A list of static route records for the route table.

~> Only one of `next_hop_address` or `gateway_id` should be specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--static_route))
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The creation timestamp of the resource.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--static_route"></a>
### Nested Schema for `static_route`

Optional:

- `destination_prefix` (String) Route prefix in CIDR notation.
- `gateway_id` (String) ID of the gateway used ad next hop.
- `next_hop_address` (String) Address of the next hop.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_vpc_route_table.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_vpc_route_table.lab-rt-a ...
```
