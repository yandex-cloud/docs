# yandex_kms_asymmetric_encryption_key (Resource)

An asymmetric KMS key that may contain several versions of the cryptographic material.

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new KMS Assymetric Encryption Key.
//
resource "yandex_kms_asymmetric_encryption_key" "key-a" {
  name                 = "example-asymetric-encryption-key"
  description          = "description for key"
  encryption_algorithm = "RSA_2048_ENC_OAEP_SHA_256"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `asymmetric_encryption_key_id` (String) ID of the asymmetric KMS key to return.
 To get the ID of an asymmetric KMS key use a [AsymmetricEncryptionKeyService.List] request.
- `deletion_protection` (Boolean) Flag that inhibits deletion of the key
- `description` (String) Description of the key.
- `encryption_algorithm` (String) Asymmetric Encryption Algorithm ID.
- `folder_id` (String) ID of the folder that the key belongs to.
- `id` (String) ID of the asymmetric KMS key to return.
 To get the ID of an asymmetric KMS key use a [AsymmetricEncryptionKeyService.List] request.
- `labels` (Map of String) Custom labels for the key as `key:value` pairs. Maximum 64 per key.
- `name` (String) Name of the key.
- `status` (String) Current status of the key.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Time when the key was created.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_kms_asymmetric_encryption_key.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_kms_asymmetric_encryption_key.key-a abj7u**********j38cd
```
