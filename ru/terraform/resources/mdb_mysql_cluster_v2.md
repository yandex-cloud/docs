# yandex_mdb_mysql_cluster_v2 (Resource)

Manages a MySQL cluster within the Yandex Cloud. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/managed-mysql/). [How to connect to the DB](https://yandex.cloud/docs/managed-mysql/quickstart#connect). To connect, use port 6432. The port number is not configurable.

## Example Usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new MDB MySQL Cluster (v2).
//

resource "yandex_mdb_mysql_cluster_v2" "cluster" {
  name        = "mysql-cluster"
  description = "MySQL Test Cluster"
  network_id  = yandex_vpc_network.mdb-pg-test-net.id
  environment = "PRODUCTION"

  labels = {
    "key1" = "value1"
    "key2" = "value2"
    "key3" = "value3"
  }

  hosts = {
