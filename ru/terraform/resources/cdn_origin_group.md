### Optional

- `folder_id` (String) The folder identifier that resource belongs to. If it is not provided, the default provider `folder-id` is used.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `use_next` (Boolean) If the option is active (has true value), in case the origin responds with 4XX or 5XX codes, use the next origin from the list.

<a id="nestedblock--origin"></a>
### Nested Schema for `origin`

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.

```bash
# terraform import yandex_cdn_origin_group.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_cdn_origin_group.my_cdn_group ...
```
