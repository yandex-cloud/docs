# yandex_vpc_security_group (Resource)

Manages a Default Security Group within the Yandex Cloud. For more information, see the official documentation of [security group](https://yandex.cloud/docs/vpc/concepts/security-groups) or [default security group](https://yandex.cloud/docs/vpc/concepts/security-groups#default-security-group).

~> This resource is not intended for managing security group in general case. To manage normal security group use [yandex_vpc_security_group](vpc_security_group.html)

When [network](https://yandex.cloud/docs/vpc/concepts/network) is created, a non-removable security group, called a *default security group*, is automatically attached to it. Life time of default security group cannot be controlled, so in fact the resource `yandex_vpc_default_security_group` does not create or delete any security groups, instead it simply takes or releases control of the default security group.

~> When Terraform takes over management of the default security group, it **deletes** all info in it (including security group rules) and replace it with specified configuration. When Terraform drops the management (i.e. when resource is deleted from statefile and management), the state of the security group **remains the same** as it was before the deletion.

~> Duplicating a resource (specifying same `network_id` for two different default security groups) will cause errors in the apply stage of your's configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new VPC Security Group.
//
resource "yandex_vpc_security_group" "sg1" {
  name        = "My security group"
  description = "description for my security group"
  network_id  = yandex_vpc_network.lab-net.id

  labels = {
    my-label = "my-label-value"
  }

  ingress {
    protocol       = "TCP"
    description    = "rule1 description"
    v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
    port           = 8080
  }

  egress {
    protocol       = "ANY"
    description    = "rule2 description"
    v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
    from_port      = 8090
    to_port        = 8099
  }

  egress {
    protocol       = "UDP"
    description    = "rule3 description"
    v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
    from_port      = 8090
    to_port        = 8099
  }
}

// Auxiliary resources
resource "yandex_vpc_network" "lab-net" {
  name = "lab-network"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `network_id` (String) ID of the network this security group belongs to.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The resource description.
- `egress` (Block Set) A list of egress rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--egress))
- `folder_id` (String) The folder identifier that resource belongs to. If it is not provided, the default provider `folder-id` is used.
- `ingress` (Block Set) A list of ingress rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--ingress))
- `labels` (Map of String) A set of key/value label pairs which assigned to resource.
- `name` (String) The resource name.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The creation timestamp of the resource.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `status` (String) Status of this security group.

<a id="nestedblock--egress"></a>
### Nested Schema for `egress`

Required:

- `protocol` (String) One of `ANY`, `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`, `IPV6_ICMP`.

Optional:

- `description` (String) Description of the rule.
- `from_port` (Number) Minimum port number.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to assign to this rule.
- `port` (Number) Port number (if applied to a single port).
- `predefined_target` (String) Special-purpose targets. `self_security_group` refers to this particular security group. `loadbalancer_healthchecks` represents [loadbalancer health check nodes](https://yandex.cloud/docs/network-load-balancer/concepts/health-check).
- `security_group_id` (String) Target security group ID for this rule.
- `to_port` (Number) Maximum port number.
- `v4_cidr_blocks` (List of String) The blocks of IPv4 addresses for this rule.
- `v6_cidr_blocks` (List of String) The blocks of IPv6 addresses for this rule. `v6_cidr_blocks` argument is currently not supported. It will be available in the future.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The resource identifier.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_vpc_security_group.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_vpc_security_group.sg1 enphq**********cjsw4
```
