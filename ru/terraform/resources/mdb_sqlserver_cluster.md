## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_mdb_sqlserver_cluster.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_mdb_sqlserver_cluster.my_cluster ...
```
