# yandex_resourcemanager_folder (Resource)

Allows creation and management of Cloud Folders for an existing Yandex Cloud. See [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy) for additional info. Note: deletion of folders may take up to 30 minutes as it requires a lot of communication between cloud services.

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new Folder.
//
resource "yandex_resourcemanager_folder" "folder1" {
  cloud_id = "my_cloud_id"
}
```
