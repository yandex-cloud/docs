# yandex_ydb_table_changefeed (Resource)

Yandex Database [table changefeed](https://ydb.tech/en/docs/concepts/cdc), or Change Data Capture (CDC) resource, keeps you informed about changes in a given table. When you add, update, or delete a table row, the CDC mechanism generates a change record where it specifies the primary key of the row and writes it to the topic partition corresponding to this key. A [topic](https://ydb.tech/en/docs/concepts/topic) is an entity for storing unstructured messages and delivering them to multiple subscribers. Basically, a topic is a named set of messages.

## Example Usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new YDB Table Change feed.
//
resource "yandex_ydb_table_changefeed" "ydb_changefeed" {
  table_id = yandex_ydb_table.test_table_2.id
  name     = "changefeed"
  mode     = "NEW_IMAGE"
  format   = "JSON"

  consumer {
    name = "test_consumer"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `format` (String) Changefeed format.
- `mode` (String) [Changefeed mode](https://ydb.tech/en/docs/yql/reference/syntax/alter_table#changefeed-options).
- `name` (String) Changefeed name.

### Optional

- `connection_string` (String) Connection string, conflicts with `table_id`.
- `consumer` (Block List) Changefeed [consumers](https://ydb.tech/en/docs/concepts/topic#consumer) - named entities for reading data from the topic. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--consumer))
- `retention_period` (String) Time of data retention in the topic, [ISO 8601](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.
- `table_id` (String) Terraform resource ID of the table.
- `table_path` (String) Table path.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `virtual_timestamps` (Boolean) Use [virtual timestamps](https://ydb.tech/en/docs/concepts/cdc#virtual-timestamps).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--consumer"></a>
### Nested Schema for `consumer`

Required:

- `name` (String) Consumer name. It is used in the SDK or CLI to [read data](https://ydb.tech/en/docs/best_practices/cdc#read) from the topic.

Optional:

- `important` (Boolean)
- `starting_message_timestamp_ms` (Number) Timestamp in the UNIX timestamp format, from which the consumer will start reading data.
- `supported_codecs` (List of String) Supported data encodings.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `default` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_ydb_table_changefeed.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_ydb_table_changefeed.ydb_changefeed ...
```
