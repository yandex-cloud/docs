# yandex_compute_snapshot_schedule_iam_binding (Resource)

Allows creation and management of a single binding within IAM policy for an existing `snapshot_schedule`.

{% note warning %}

**Warning:** This resource is authoritative for the given `role` on the target `snapshot_schedule` and manages the complete set of its members. When you change or delete `yandex_compute_snapshot_schedule_iam_binding`, the `role` may be removed from other subjects on the `snapshot_schedule` as well — including subjects granted outside of this resource (via the corresponding `*_iam_member` resource, the management console, CLI or API). Those subjects are not tracked in the Terraform state, so a plain `terraform plan` does not list them. Be careful.

{% endnote %}


## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new Compute Snapshot Schedule and new IAM Binding for it.
//
resource "yandex_compute_snapshot_schedule" "schedule1" {
  schedule_policy {
    expression = "0 0 * * *"
  }

  retention_period = "12h"

  snapshot_spec {
    description = "retention-snapshot"
  }

  disk_ids = ["test_disk_id", "another_test_disk_id"]
}

resource "yandex_compute_snapshot_schedule_iam_binding" "editor" {
  snapshot_schedule_id = data.yandex_compute_snapshot_schedule.schedule1.id

  role = "editor"

  members = [
    "userAccount:some_user_id",
  ]
}
```

## Arguments & Attributes Reference
