```terraform
//
// Create a new NLB Target Group.
//
resource "yandex_lb_target_group" "my_tg" {
  name      = "my-target-group"
  region_id = "ru-central1"

  target {
    subnet_id = yandex_vpc_subnet.my-subnet.id
    address   = yandex_compute_instance.my-instance-1.network_interface.0.ip_address
  }

  target {
    subnet_id = yandex_vpc_subnet.my-subnet.id
    address   = yandex_compute_instance.my-instance-2.network_interface.0.ip_address

## Schema

### Optional

- `description` (String) The resource description.
- `folder_id` (String) The folder identifier that resource belongs to. If it is not provided, the default provider `folder-id` is used.
- `labels` (Map of String) A set of key/value label pairs which assigned to resource.
- `name` (String) The resource name.
- `region_id` (String) ID of the availability zone where the target group resides. If omitted, default region is being used.
- `target` (Block Set) A Target resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--target))
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The creation timestamp of the resource.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--target"></a>
### Nested Schema for `target`

Required:

- `address` (String) IP address of the target.
- `subnet_id` (String) ID of the subnet that targets are connected to. All targets in the target group must be connected to the same subnet within a single availability zone.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_lb_target_group.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_lb_target_group.my_tg ...
```
