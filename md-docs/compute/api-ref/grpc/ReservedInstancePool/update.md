# Compute Cloud API, gRPC: ReservedInstancePoolService.Update

Updates the specified reserved instance pool.

## gRPC request

**rpc Update ([UpdateReservedInstancePoolRequest](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.UpdateReservedInstancePoolRequest)) returns ([operation.Operation](#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation))**

## UpdateReservedInstancePoolRequest {#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.UpdateReservedInstancePoolRequest}

```json
{
  "reserved_instance_pool_id": "string",
  "update_mask": "google.protobuf.FieldMask",
  "name": "string",

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| reserved_instance_pool_id | **string**

ID of the reserved instance pool to update.
To get the reserved instance pool ID, use a [ReservedInstancePoolService.List](list.md#List) request.
The length must be less than or equal to 50.
This field is required. ||
|| update_mask | **[google.protobuf.FieldMask](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/field-mask)**

Field mask that specifies which fields of the reserved instance pool should be updated. ||
|| name | **string**

New name for the reserved instance pool.
The value must match the regular expression: ```|[a-z]([-_a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?```. ||
|| description | **string**

Description of the reserved instance pool.
The length must be less than or equal to 256. ||
|| labels | **object** (map<**string**, **string**>)

Resource labels as `key:value` pairs.
Existing set of `labels` is completely replaced by the provided set.
Each map key must match the regular expression: `[a-z][-_./\\@0-9a-z]*`.
Each map value must match the regular expression: `[-_./\\@0-9a-z]*`.
The length of each map key must be between 1 and 63.
The length of each map value must be less than or equal to 63.
The number of elements must be less than or equal to 64. ||
|| size | **int64**

Desired size of the pool.
The value must be between 0 and 1048576. ||
|| allow_oversubscription | **bool**

Allows the pool to contain more linked instances than the number of available slots (size without pending or unavailable slots).
While running instances are still limited by available slots, stopped instances can exceed this limit.
Warning: When this option is enabled, attempting to start more instances than the number of available slots will result in a "Not Enough Resources" error. ||
|| allow_pending_slots | **bool**

This field affects only the current request and allows size-increasing operation to complete successfully even when there are not enough resources.
In such cases, some of the new pool slots become "pending", meaning they cannot be used until resources become available.
Pending slots automatically convert to normal slots when sufficient resources are available. ||

## operation.Operation {#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation}

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "created_at": "google.protobuf.Timestamp",
  "created_by": "string",
  "modified_at": "google.protobuf.Timestamp",
  "done": "bool",
  "metadata": "google.protobuf.Any",
  // Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`
  "error": "google.rpc.Status",
  "response": "google.protobuf.Any"
  // end of the list of possible fields
}
```

An Operation resource. For more information, see [Operation](../../../../api-design-guide/concepts/operation.md).

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| id | **string**

ID of the operation. ||
|| description | **string**

Description of the operation. 0-256 characters long. ||
|| created_at | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**

Creation timestamp. ||
|| created_by | **string**

ID of the user or service account who initiated the operation. ||
|| modified_at | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**

The time when the Operation resource was last modified. ||
|| done | **bool**

If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. ||
|| metadata | **[google.protobuf.Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any)**

Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.
It typically contains the ID of the target resource that the operation is performed on.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. ||
|| error | **[google.rpc.Status](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/reference/rpc/google.rpc#status)**

The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||
|| response | **[google.protobuf.Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any)**

The normal response of the operation in case of success.
If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete,
the response is [google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty).
If the original method is the standard Create/Update,
the response should be the target resource of the operation.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the response type, if any.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||
